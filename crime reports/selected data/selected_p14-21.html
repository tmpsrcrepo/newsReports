<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serious </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Prince William </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">County</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dropped for the second consecutive year, according to 2003 statistics released this week by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">county</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> police department.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although 13 killings occurred last year -- almost tying the decade-high of 14 reached in 1999 -- the number of all major </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the state's third-largest jurisdiction fell by about 2.7 percent.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> such as murder, rape and burglary dropped from 8,025 to 7,805, while the overall </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rate dipped from nearly 26 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> per 1,000 residents to about 24 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> per 1,000 residents, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">report</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Chief Charlie T. Deane said the statistics represent the lowest recorded rate in the 34-year-old department's history, but that the rate will inevitably rise again because of growth in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">county,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which now has a population of 332,500. No single factor explains the unpredictable rise and fall of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rates, Deane said, but active neighborhood watch groups and the department's aggressive crackdown on gangs  have put potential offenders on alert. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This can't last forever. There's a point that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rate will not go below [because] the juvenile population is very high,&quot; Deane said. &quot;But I see results almost daily. [Gangs] know they're going to be held accountable. A lot of them are in jail today.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of last year's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- more than 93 percent -- were related to property, and about 6.7 percent were violent, police said. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">county's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 13 homicides last year -- including a triple homicide --  were more than double the number (five) that occurred in 2002, but Deane said those figures have always fluctuated.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1999, for example, there were 14 homicides; in 2000, there were six; and in 2001, the figure jumped back to 13. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to keep these statistics in perspective,&quot; Deane said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only major increase in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> occurred in the number of motor vehicle thefts, which jumped from 665 to 755. Deane described the growing problem as a &quot;regionwide issue&quot; and added that there also has been a rise in heavy equipment thefts at construction sites. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Domestic assaults, which soared in 2001 with 1,680 reported incidents, have gradually declined, dropping to 1,451 last year. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">report</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> showed only a tiny percentage of those are aggravated assaults such as shootings or stabbings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deane said the declining overall </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rate was even more notable given the amount of time some officers spent on other work, such as analyzing terrorism threat levels and concentrating on last year's trial of sniper John Allen Muhammad in Virginia Beach. &quot;We had five of our most experienced detectives and supervisors commit to that investigation,&quot; he said. &quot;It's hard to replace that experience.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for gang activity, Deane and Maj. Ray Colgan said gangs continue to proliferate and break into smaller groups, threatening to raise the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> level. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Different cliques are emerging and we're seeing new [gang] names we haven't seen before,&quot; Colgan said. </SPAN></P>
