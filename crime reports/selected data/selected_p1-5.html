<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Tuesday evening ordered the armed services to immediately &quot;re-train, re-credential and re-screen&quot; tens of thousands of military recruiters and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">sexual-assault</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prevention officers as the revelation of another sex-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> scandal rocked the Pentagon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hagel's order came in response to the Army's disclosure Tuesday that a sergeant first class responsible for handling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">sexual-assault</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cases at Fort Hood, Tex., had been placed under criminal investigation over allegations of abusive sexual contact and other related matters. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators are also scrutinizing allegations that the sergeant may have forced a subordinate into prostitution, according to a U.S. official familiar with the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Army investigation comes just 10 days after a lieutenant colonel who led the Air Force's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">sexual-assault</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prevention programs was arrested in Arlington </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">County</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on charges that he groped and battered a woman in a parking lot. That incident, along with fresh statistics showing that sex </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have become endemic in the military, sparked a furious response from lawmakers on Capitol Hill and President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hagel warned last week that the military's ability to recruit and perform its missions was becoming endangered by deepening public perceptions that the armed forces are unable or unwilling to cope with a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">sexual-assault</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> crisis in the ranks. The latest embarrassment only made him more angry, Pentagon officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot convey strongly enough his frustration, anger and disappointment over these troubling allegations and the breakdown in discipline and standards they imply,&quot; said George Little, the Pentagon press secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense officials said Hagel learned of the Army investigation Tuesday morning from Army Secretary John McHugh. But the Pentagon did not publicly disclose the case until Tuesday evening, several hours after Hagel appeared at a town hall meeting for Defense Department employees at the Mark Center in Alexandria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither the Pentagon nor the Army identified the sergeant because no charges have been filed. Special agents from the Army's Criminal Investigation Command are probing allegations that the sergeant first class mistreated subordinates, committed assault and abusive sexual contact, and engaged in pandering, the Pentagon said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said the noncommissioned officer had been suspended from duties as an &quot;equal-opportunity adviser&quot; and sexual-harassment and assault prevention officer at Fort Hood, one of the Army's biggest installations. The Pentagon did not disclose when the allegations first came to light or how many victims may have been involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaction from lawmakers was swift and livid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tragically, the depth of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">sexual-assault</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> problem in our military was already overwhelmingly clear before this latest highly disturbing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">report,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; said Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said lawmakers would push ahead with a number of measures to address </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">sexual assault</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the armed forces, including changes to military law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Niki Tsongas (D-Mass.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, called the Fort Hood revelations &quot;utterly abhorrent.&quot; She added that &quot;it has become painfully evident that saying the military has a cultural problem in regard to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">sexual assault</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and sexual misconduct is a glaring understatement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Howard P. &quot;Buck&quot; McKeon (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said that he was &quot;outraged and disgusted&quot; and that his faith in the military to police sex </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was &quot;deeply shaken.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said she would introduce legislation Thursday to change military law so that independent prosecutors, not commanders, would be responsible for handling sex </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other serious offenses. Military leaders have strenuously resisted such proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is time to get serious and get to work reforming the military justice system that clearly isn't working,&quot; Gillibrand said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to directing that hundreds of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">sexual-assault</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prevention coordinators be retrained and rescreened, Hagel ordered the same treatment for all military recruiters. That move alone would affect an estimated 20,000 recruiters for the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post reported Monday that military recruiters across the country have been caught in a string of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">sexual-assault</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> scandals over the past year. The Pentagon, however, does not have a grasp on the extent of the problem because it does not track sex </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> committed by its personnel against civilians before they enlist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the Pentagon released a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">report</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> estimating that the number of military personnel victimized by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">sexual assault</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and related </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had surged by about 35 percent over the past two years despite intensive efforts to confront the problem. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pentagon survey estimated that 26,000 troops experienced &quot;unwanted sexual contact&quot; last year. Yet only a fraction of that number - 3,374 - filed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">sexual-assault</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">reports</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with military police or prosecutors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military officials said most victims are reluctant to press charges because they fear retaliation from their superiors or ostracism from their units, or that investigators won't take their cases seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawmakers and victim advocates also blame an unwillingness among many commanders to deal with the problem forthrightly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of Congress said they were outraged to learn about two cases in which Air Force generals granted clemency to convicted sex offenders, adding that the decisions would discourage other victims from reporting rape or sexual abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is abundantly clear that the military cannot adequately handle its sexual violence crisis from within,&quot; said Anu Bhagwati, a former Marine captain and executive director of the Service Women's Action Network, an advocacy group. &quot;If military culture is to transform in any meaningful way, we need to break down the doors of silence and make sure our troops who are harmed have access to the same legal remedies as all civilians whom they protect and defend.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montgomery </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">County</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Superintendent Paul L. Vance, citing an increase in school </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crime,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposed yesterday establishing an alternative school for violent students and taking other steps to tighten security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe these recommendations, while unfortunate in their necessity, are an appropriate response to the increasing occurrence of criminal activity by students and outsiders . . . that affect the health and welfare of the entire school community,&quot; he wrote in a letter that accompanied the proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe the situation will get worse if we do not invest in the improvements necessary to address the security and safety needs in all of our schools,&quot; he added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling expulsion &quot;a necessary option,&quot; Vance said he wants to review the expulsion process for dangerous students. His proposal also recommends legislation to give school administrators access to juvenile </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> records and to impose stiffer punishments for people who commit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on school property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vance proposed additional security training for all school employees and providing security staff with better equipment, such as metal detectors. His plan also urges establishment of a community-watch program around the schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school board will discuss the proposals at its Feb. 11 meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alternative schools have been criticized elsewhere as dumping grounds, but Vance insisted his would help violent students by providing them with extra counseling. It also would help keep other students safe, he said. &quot;I see it as an alternative center where we'll be successful in turning out good citizens,&quot; he said. &quot;We cannot throw these kids into a garbage can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vance did not specify how much his recommendations would cost, but said he thinks residents would approve of spending on school safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, the money isn't there,&quot; he said at a briefing yesterday. &quot;But I submit to you this issue is so critical that the money will be found . . . . I cannot imagine our citizens depriving us of the resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">School officials said there has been a considerable increase in school </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the last few years, although they did not supply data supporting that assertion. In the first 10 months of 1991, there were 10 incidents involving guns, school officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far this year, two </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">sexual assaults</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have been reported during this school year, compared with three for all of the previous year, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Vance said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">county's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> schools are still considerably safer than those of other jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said he views the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">sexual assaults</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and gun incidents as a warning, adding that if security deteriorates, parents might take their children out of the school system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vance's plan was released in conjunction with a $ 6,500 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">report</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> written by consultants with the National Alliance for Safe Schools. That </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">report</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> concluded that trespassers are the biggest single cause of concern among teachers, students, parents and administrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of a coalition of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">county</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parent-teacher associations, Sharon Friedman, said she agrees with trying to improve school security, but wonders how the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">county</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would pay for Vance's suggestions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bottom line for most parents is: Are their children going to school in a safe environment?&quot; she said, but added, &quot;we're looking at a rather bleak fiscal climate . . . . Will the money be there to fund these sorts of things?&quot;</SPAN></P>
