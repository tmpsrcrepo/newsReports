<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince William </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">County's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> overall </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rate fell to a 16-year low last year, despite a slight uptick in aggravated assault and larceny cases, according to the 2010 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> statistics </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">report</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> released Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Prince William's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rate dropped from 19.5 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> per 1,000 residents to 19.2, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">report</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. Violent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">crimes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> including murder, rape and robbery, dropped almost 6 percent, while aggravated assault and larceny went up 3.7 percent and 2 percent, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continues to be down significantly, and that's a trend we're seeing across the country,&quot; Prince William Police Chief Charlie T. Deane said. &quot;I think our strong neighborhood watch program and citizens police academy&quot; have helped keep </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rates low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of reported rapes dropped 7 percent last year, after almost doubling in 2009, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">report</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. In all 53 rape cases reported, the victims were related to or acquainted with the offender, according to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c9">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against property, which make up the majority of offenses in the community, rose 0.6 percent because of the increase in larceny cases, Deane said. The number of burglary and car theft cases declined, Deane said, adding that he attributes the drop in car thefts to a rise in the use of vehicle security devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">report</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also breaks down the number of undocumented immigrants arrested in Prince William.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">county</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supervisors adopted a policy that requires police to ask the immigration status of people arrested on suspicion of violating state or local laws. Of the 1,785 people arrested last year in connection with major </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">crimes,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 138 - or about 8 percent - were illegal immigrants, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">report</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shows, noting that 80 percent of those arrests were for property </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When looking at other offenses, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">report</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shows that about 20 percent of those arrested for public drunkenness were suspected illegal immigrants, as were about 16 percent of those arrested for drunken driving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">report</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also addresses traffic offenses. The number of traffic accidents declined almost 7 percent last year, although the number of fatal accidents increased slightly, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">report</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. Last year, 22 people died from traffic accidents, including six pedestrians. </SPAN></P>

During the next 18 months, Smith will manage the changeover of the Rockville jail into a central booking and intake center, where inmates will stay 72 hours or less before being released by the court or transferred to Clarksburg. Smith is a former acting warden of the center. </SPAN></P>
