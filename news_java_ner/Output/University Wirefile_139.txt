Lawyers representing the <ORGANIZATION>University Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> met <DATE>July 20</DATE> with five former employees who are suing <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> on grounds they were unjustly fired . 
Lawyers for both sides discussed the possibility of resolving the case outside of court , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Louise Dudley</PERSON> said . 
The former employees were fired in <DATE>May</DATE> after three patients in the psychiatric ward were allegedly raped . 
The suspect in two of the rapes , <PERSON>Rudolph T. Johnson Jr.</PERSON> , had been convicted of a felony prior to taking the job at the Medical Center . 
Reacting to the alleged assaults , the Medical Center reviewed the applications of temporary and probationary employees , firing those who had previous criminal records . 
Probationary employees are workers who have been working at <ORGANIZATION>the Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> six months or less . 
The fired employees are suing for back pay and to return to their old jobs or similar jobs at the Medical Center . 
They argue that the firings were unfair , as the employees had nothing to do with alleged assaults at the hospital . 
If the lawyers do not reach a resolution before <DATE>Aug. 16</DATE> , the court will hear the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's motion to dismiss the case . 
" We might resolve it , we might not , " said <PERSON>Robert P. Dwoskin</PERSON> , the attorney representing the fired workers . 
The motion to dismiss argues that the employees were all temporary or probationary and had no contractual agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Therefore , both the employees and the employer were free to terminate employment at any time . 
Neither <PERSON>Dwoskin</PERSON> nor <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> officials were able to comment further on the case , as it is an ongoing legal matter . 
As lawyers met inside the courthouse , members of <ORGANIZATION>the Labor Action Group</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Association</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Advancement of Colored People</ORGANIZATION> gathered outside the courthouse to express their support for the fired workers . 
About 20 people , including <LOCATION>Charlottesville City</LOCATION> Councilwoman <PERSON>Meredith Richards</PERSON> gathered in front of the courthouse for a " peaceful show of solidarity , " LAG member <PERSON>Susan Fraiman</PERSON> said . 
" These events were used to scapegoat the most vulnerable workers at U.Va. , " <ORGANIZATION>Labor Action Group</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Susan Fraiman</PERSON> said . 
The workers were easy to fire because they were temporary or probationary . 
She added that the firing of the employees did not solve the problem of the assaults . 
LAG members started a workers ' defense fund to " help the workers pay bills while they are out of work , " she said , adding that some of the fired workers have taken part-time jobs while they wait for the case to be settled . 
So far , LAG has raised <MONEY>$ 3,500</MONEY> . 
LAG began petitioning on behalf of the workers and already has received more than 1,000 signatures from the community , <PERSON>Fraiman</PERSON> said . 
The <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION> has shown support for the fired employees because eight of the nine original fired workers were black , <PERSON>Fraiman</PERSON> said . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION> feels ( the firings ) are part of a larger pattern of racial discrimination at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . " 
<PERSON>Mary Smith</PERSON> , one of the five plaintiffs said she " was really pleased with LAG and the <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION> . 
LAG has been there since the beginning . " 
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said she expected good things to come out of the meetings with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> lawyers .
