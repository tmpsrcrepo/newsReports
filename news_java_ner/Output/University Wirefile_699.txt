<PERSON>Ashley Belfort</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily Incoming Student Council</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Abraham Axler</PERSON> said he was not intimately involved in the process of formulating the panel , but he did help balance the board where views were lacking . 
A panel on due process , Title IX and campus sexual misconduct was held at the <LOCATION>Caplin Pavilion</LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University Law School</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> . 
After concerns about poor representation on the panel , <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> decided yesterday to no longer sponsor the event . 
Student Council President-elect <PERSON>Abe Axler</PERSON> , a second-year College student , said he was not intimately involved in the process of formulating the panel , but he did help balance the board where views were lacking . 
" Yesterday I was getting a lot of really concerned emails about the composition of the panel , " <PERSON>Axler</PERSON> said . 
" It was troublesome that it was very one-sided with people who were not very reflective of the most rigorous academic conversation . " 
<PERSON>Axler</PERSON> said when <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> realized the panel did not fairly represent a viewpoint in favor of Title IX or <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> processes for handling campus violence , there were three speakers on the panel . 
The first speaker was <PERSON>Heather MacDonald</PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION>Manhattan Institute for Policy Research</ORGANIZATION> . 
She has written many articles , including " The Campus Rape Myth , " for The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , and <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> . 
The second speaker was <PERSON>Stuart Taylor</PERSON> from the Brookings Institution . 
He is a freelance journalist who focuses on legal and policy issues . 
He coauthored a book titled " Until Proven Innocent : Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustice of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case . " 
The last speaker was <PERSON>Susan Kruth</PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION>Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</ORGANIZATION> , an organization with the mission of defending the individual rights on <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's colleges and campuses . 
<PERSON>Axler</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> realized the panel was missing a feminist viewpoint , which needed to be balanced . 
Because the panel date was quickly approaching , <PERSON>Axler</PERSON> said he acknowledged the difficulty in finding a feminist legal theorist to bring diversity of thought to the panel . 
Axler asked <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> alumna <PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> , project coordinator for the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs , to speak on the panel . 
Renda is well known throughout the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community for her involvement in sexual assault prevention and awareness . 
Last year , she was the co-chair of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Leadership Council</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I called <PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> , a known feminist and asked her to join the panel , " <PERSON>Axler</PERSON> said . 
" There were concerns whether this was still enough . " 
<PERSON>Axler</PERSON> said in light of recent events at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , this conversation is a necessary one , whether or not <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> offers direct sponsorship . 
" It was still an important conversation to have about due process . 
We [ StudCo ] just were not confident in getting 100 percent behind it . "
