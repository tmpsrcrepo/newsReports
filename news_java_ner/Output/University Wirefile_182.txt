" Do you think girls have anything to offer the boy scouts ? 
We have the right to choose and associate with who we please . " 
These are the words of <PERSON>Hootie Johnson</PERSON> , chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Augusta National</ORGANIZATION> ( the golf club where the Masters are held every <DATE>April</DATE> ) , in response to the accusation that he believes women have nothing to offer his golf club . 
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> and his club alike have come under fire in recent days as he has responded to the <ORGANIZATION>National Council of Women</ORGANIZATION> 's Organizations ' demands that <ORGANIZATION>Augusta National</ORGANIZATION> admit women members . 
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> has adamantly clung to the club 's right to privacy in order to fend off women 's leader <PERSON>Martha Burke</PERSON> and other dissenters . 
Johnson is absolutely right . 
His club is private . 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Constitution guarantees that <ORGANIZATION>Augusta National</ORGANIZATION> has every right to choose its membership . 
However , the public has the right to dissent . 
Although <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> is entitled to out-dated and prejudiced views , it would be a wiser , more progressive , and more moral decision to reconsider his stance on the issue , and allow otherwise qualified women membership in his club . 
It has been brought to <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> 's attention that there is a strong parallel between gender and racial discrimination . 
In response to this claim , <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Fox Sports</ORGANIZATION> , " Nobody accepts [ these ] as being the same . " 
This claim seems somewhat hard to swallow however , when one observes the main argument that <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> uses to defend his decision to continue the exclusion of women from <ORGANIZATION>Augusta National</ORGANIZATION> . 
Johnson argues , " Our club has enjoyed a camaraderie and a closeness that has served us well for so long , that it makes it difficult for us to consider change . " 
Basically , <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> contends , admitting women to the club would be disruptive to the order <ORGANIZATION>Augusta National</ORGANIZATION> has enjoyed up to this point . 
Interesting point , especially because it is nearly exactly reflective of one of the main arguments traditionally used in the past to exclude African-Americans from the armed forces . 
Although the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> armed forces and a private golf club are obviously two different things , a comparison of their respective arguments for exclusion testifies to the fact that <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> is wrong when he claims that there is a far distance between racial and gender discrimination . 
Also , this " disruption " <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> speaks of hardly seems a legitimate reason to keep women from membership given the fact that , as even <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> himself admits , women play on the course all the time . 
It 's clear that <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> is on the defensive . 
Due to the recent controversy , his sponsors have withdrawn their support ( though he claims he is confident they will return ) , and there have been murmurs of dissent from <ORGANIZATION>Augusta National</ORGANIZATION> standing membership . 
In response , <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> has made clear that <ORGANIZATION>Augusta National</ORGANIZATION> will not allow women membership , " at the point of a bayonet . " 
Though it seems that <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> does genuinely have some aversion to the presence of female members at his club , one can also , given his increasingly hostile manner , suspect that he has taken up a personal agenda on this issue . 
Given the media attention this has received , in addition to the statements he has already made , he does not want to back down . 
However , the reality of the situation is this : if historical trends are any indication , like it or not , <ORGANIZATION>Augusta National</ORGANIZATION> is going to admit women . 
It might not be today , it might not be tomorrow , but it is going to happen , and most likely it is going to happen in the next ten years . 
Not only would it be more morally justifiable for <ORGANIZATION>Augusta National</ORGANIZATION> to concede to admitting women , it would be wise . 
<PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> has the opportunity to save himself the headache of continued public scrutiny and harassment by women 's organizations . 
He could stop picket lines before they start . 
Or he could stick to his position as it now stands . 
The call is certainly his to make , but it would be wise for him to step back from his ego and his prejudices and see the larger picture . 
It is true that <ORGANIZATION>Augusta National</ORGANIZATION> has come under such ( some would say unfair ) scrutiny due to the fact that it hosts the Masters . 
It is unlikely that , were it a regular small town golf club , the nation would take such note of its exclusive membership . 
In the <ORGANIZATION>Fox Sports</ORGANIZATION> interview , <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> stated , " [ the Masters ] is one week . 
51 weeks of the year we are a private club . 
And we do something good for one week , for the sporting world , and we 're going to be penalized . " 
This is fair . 
<ORGANIZATION>Augusta National</ORGANIZATION> does not deserve to be penalized , harassed and scrutinized merely because it is an exceptional club that has risen to national prominence . 
However , <ORGANIZATION>Augusta National</ORGANIZATION> should seize upon its national notoriety in order to take advantage of the great chance it now has to set an example of progressiveness , egalitarianism and respect for the rest of the country .
