Courtesy <PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> As part of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's ongoing efforts to combat sexual misconduct , the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs recently created a handful of focus groups to gauge students ' knowledge of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual misconduct policy . 
The Office has conducted six focus groups to date - four for undergraduate students and two for graduate students . 
Facilitators put participants into scenarios to test their knowledge of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's policies . 
<PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> , project coordinator for the student affairs office , said the focus groups will both allow officials to see what students understand about the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's policy and serve to educate students about the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's definition of consent , and the process of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual misconduct board . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> recently decided to revise its sexual misconduct policy to comply with new federal recommendations . 
In an email sent to focus group participants , the office said it will use the collected data to " inform our education and outreach efforts when the revised policy is rolled out in <DATE>January 2015</DATE> . " 
Associate Dean of Students <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> said students can expect to see a new sexual misconduct policy with definitions that will be " more fleshed out . " 
" We are in the process of revision based on changes in campus data , " <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> said . 
" You 'll see some more defined terms , and in some other areas some more meat on the bones of the definitions . " 
The new policy will also add language on intimate partner violence and provide examples for what constitutes consent . 
" We are always trying to learn things when we implement policies , " <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> said . 
" Obviously we are always trying to make revisions and improvements . " 
The Office of the <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Students</ORGANIZATION> has also increased its focus on prevention efforts - launching the Not on our Grounds and <PERSON>Hoos</PERSON> Got Your Back campaigns this semester . 
To further these efforts , <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> said , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> will institute a " Green Dot " sexual violence reduction program during the <DATE>spring</DATE> semester . 
The Green Dot initiative is part of a national effort and involves intensive training on bystander intervention .
