Cavalier Daily Students and members of the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> community gathered at the <LOCATION>Rotunda</LOCATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE> to rally against gender-based violence at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> and in the greater <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> area . 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Greg Lewis</PERSON> , a leader of the rally , said it was held in response to the disappearance of second-year <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> , as well as what he said is a pattern of sexual assault and gender-based violence at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" This is a group of us - of concerned people and concerned community members and concerned U.Va . 
students - getting together to address this and put in on the table , " <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> said . 
The event was originally scheduled for <DATE>Sept. 19</DATE> , but it was moved to <DATE>Sept. 26</DATE> to allow the group more time to plan the event . 
" We wanted more time to organize , to get people out , to get people engaged in a conversation , " <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> said . 
" We also wanted to give space to <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> 's friends and her family ... so we decided to move it to this <DATE>Friday</DATE> so we could all mobilize together and come out to support survivors of gender-based violence . " 
<PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , director of the Gender Violence and Social Change Program for the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Women 's Center</ORGANIZATION> , said the different forms of violence present at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> serve as forms of oppression . 
" The conversation needs to start at this level , and we need to talk about violence , sexual violence , gender-based violence , power-based violence , as a form of oppression , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
" If you think of it that way it makes it easy to think of other forms of oppression as being interlinked with that . 
We ca n't have a conversation about this without talking about other kinds of oppression because they overlap . " 
<PERSON>Anna Boynton</PERSON> , a fourth-year College Student and another rally leader , spoke specifically about sexual violence toward women at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" A study here at U.Va . 
in <DATE>2009</DATE> found that <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT> of sorority women have been sexually assaulted during their time here , and around <PERCENT>7 percent</PERCENT> of women in the general population have been as well , " <PERSON>Boynton</PERSON> said . 
" I think these numbers are really unfortunate , they 're not necessary . " 
Boynton said women who attend college are more likely to be sexually assaulted than women who do not . 
" We do not need to sacrifice the integrity of our bodies for the integrity of our minds , " <PERSON>Boynton</PERSON> said . 
" We see our colleagues being expelled for honor violations on our exams , but we have n't seen in 14 years a single expulsion because of rape . 
I think that for me as a woman this tells me that this university values my test scores over my body . " 
Many different <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> groups supported the rally , including Queer and Allied Activism , <LOCATION>U.Va</LOCATION> . 
Students United , the Women 's Center and <ORGANIZATION>Students for Peace and Justice</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Palestine</LOCATION> . 
Yahiya Saad , third-year College student and president of <ORGANIZATION>Students for Peace and Justice</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Palestine</LOCATION> , said gender violence is not only a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> problem , but a global one . 
" The assault of a U.Va . 
student is just as bad as the assault of a <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> community member , is just as bad as the assault on a Palestinian refugee , is just as bad as the assault on a woman , or even a man anywhere in this world , " <PERSON>Saad</PERSON> said . 
" I got super enraged about this issue just a couple weeks ago . 
... Now is the time to get people to be attentive , to look at these issues . " 
Many members of the rally held signs with phrases like " We deserve a safe school , " " 1 week 1 disappearance 3 sexual assaults - this needs to end " and " It 's on us . " 
<PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> led the crowd in chants shouting , " Yes means yes " and , " end gender violence now . " 
" I believe that U.Va . 
has a dominant culture , and I think that dominant culture marginalizes women , marginalizes people of color , marginalizes queer people and marginalizes community members , " <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> said . 
" That 's not the whole community , but it 's a few individual members , and one manifestation of those marginalizations is the problem of gender-based violence . 
And I do n't think anyone can deny that this is a problem . "
