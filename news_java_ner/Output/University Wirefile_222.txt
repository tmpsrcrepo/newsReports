In response to community criticism about the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> ( <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> ) <ORGANIZATION>Police Department</ORGANIZATION> 's months-long procedure of asking certain black men to voluntarily provide DNA samples in their search for the serial rapist , Police Chief <PERSON>Timothy Longo</PERSON> has temporarily stopped the practice . 
Calling it a " common sense decision , " <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> said that due to the level of concern raised in <DATE>Monday</DATE> 's <PERSON>Clark Hall</PERSON> community meeting , the police department stepped back to " re-engineer the process . " 
" We decided to step back to look at our process to consider issues raised by the community and reach a common ground that is respectful of community values , but at the same time , allows us to continue our investigation , " he said . 
Although the department has had the ability to use the DNA sampling procedure -- called the " buccal swab " -- since <DATE>April 2001</DATE> , the serial rapist case was the first chosen to include it . 
According to <LOCATION>Longo</LOCATION> , police have not acquired a buccal swab since <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> . 
In a private meeting tomorrow , <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> will present specific future plans and changes for investigation procedure to a handful of community representatives . 
African-American Affairs <PERSON>Dean M. Rick Turner</PERSON> , who has voiced concern about the DNA sampling , said he will attend tomorrow 's meeting and looks forward to a positive outcome . 
<PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said the meeting itself is already a step in the right direction . 
" I wanted both communities to talk and to come to some kind of agreement that the procedure should be changed , " he said . 
" The community spoke , and the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> listened . " 
Turner added that he expects <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> to solicit comments and suggestions on the new procedure . 
In a letter sent to <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> yesterday , <PERSON>Kent Willis</PERSON> , the executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> , listed the organization 's own suggestions on how best the police can use a DNA dragnet . 
" In the best possible world , [ police ] wo n't reinstate it at all , " <PERSON>Willis</PERSON> said . 
However , anticipating a reinstatement , <PERSON>Willis</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> is urging <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> to adopt restricted criteria for sampling that include : establishing probable cause , protecting individuals ' privacy and informing people of their constitutional right to refuse . 
In addition to the letter , the <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> has continued work producing a flier that will let people know they have a right to refuse a sample and ask them to contact the office to document a sample request , <PERSON>Willis</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Longo</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> police began using the buccal swab after attacks in <DATE>November</DATE> and <DATE>April</DATE> of last year . 
Since that time , 197 African American men have been asked to submit to DNA swabs . 
A total of 10 have refused . 
Despite recent community concerns about the use of the " DNA dragnet , " <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> expressed confidence in the department 's continued use of forensic science . 
" If we take the opportunity now to ensure that the procedure , and guidelines in place to support the process , are ones the community has confidence in , you can certainly continue to use it , " he said . 
" Forensic technology , forensic science and the use of DNA have had remarkable success and we need to continue to take advantage of that value . " 
Above all else , however , <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> stressed the necessity of communication and collaboration . 
<LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> 's ability to " reach a common good " will not only better serve the city , but also act as a model for other communities , he said . 
" I 'm very confident that if this issue comes up somewhere in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , that community will be able to look at us and ask how did they deal with it in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , " <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> said . 
The recent controversy has sparked significant national media attention . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> has been following the story and police officials said yesterday they were fielding calls from the <ORGANIZATION>MSNBC</ORGANIZATION> and Court TV networks .
