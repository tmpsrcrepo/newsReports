Last <DATE>summer</DATE> , well known philosopher <PERSON>Colin McGinn</PERSON> resigned from his tenured post at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Miami</ORGANIZATION> , where a graduate student accused him of sexually harassing her . 
This is not an isolated incident . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University of Colorado</ORGANIZATION> recently made public an independent investigation that found sexual harassment and bullying within their own philosophy department , a report that has now led administrators to remove the chairman and suspend all graduate student admissions into the department until at least <DATE>fall 2015</DATE> . 
Sexual harassment is apparently occurring in college philosophy departments around the country . 
Such behavior on the part of professors and the high proportion of men in the discipline demonstrate that women are discriminated against in academic philosophy . 
This discrimination , or at least discomfort among women trying to succeed in philosophy , is seen in the <ORGANIZATION>Society for Philosophy</ORGANIZATION> and Psychology-supported research by <PERSON>Molly Paxton</PERSON> , <PERSON>Carrie Figdor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Valerie Tiberius</PERSON> , who collected data from over 700 male and female students on their experiences in the <ORGANIZATION>Introduction to Philosophy</ORGANIZATION> course at their university . 
From this research , it is apparent that women most often drop philosophy between enrollment in an introductory philosophy class and declaring a philosophy major . 
For example , according to a separate study , women at <ORGANIZATION>Georgia State</ORGANIZATION> make up about <PERCENT>55 percent</PERCENT> of Introduction to Philosophy students , but that number drops to <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT> by the time students have declared a philosophy major.In addition , the research shows that the course reading for philosophy classes was at <PERCENT>89 percent</PERCENT> male authors , with a small minority of time alotted to studying female philsophers . 
The findings from the <ORGANIZATION>Georgia State</ORGANIZATION> study above also show that overall , female students found the philosophy course less enjoyable than male students . 
They also found that female students believed the material was n't as relevant to their lives , compared with their male peers . 
Females also said they felt that they had less in common with typical philosophy majors or with their instructors , and reported feeling less able and likely to succeed in philosophy . 
Finally , the females in the study said they were less comfortable participating in class discussions and that they were less inclined to take a second philosophy course or to major in philosophy than male students . 
Significantly , the study by <LOCATION>Paxton</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Figdor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tiberius</PERSON> also found a significant , positive correlation between the proportion of female faculty in an institution 's philosophy department and the proportion of females in the philosophy major . 
Such a finding is strong evidence for the power of positive role models to address gender imbalances . 
Masculinity is frequently associated with rationality and independence , so it makes sense that this reason-centric and highly individualistic discipline perpetuates masculine and sometimes misogynistic practices . 
Most philosophers these days are , in fact , white men . 
And statistics show that since <DATE>2010</DATE> , philosophy has had a lower percentage of women doctorates than math , chemistry and economics . 
Some argue it is intentional - that male philosophers do not want women to succeed in their profession . 
Some say that men believe women are , as the famous philosopher <PERSON>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</PERSON> so nicely put it , " not adapted to the higher sciences " like philosophy . 
While that was a sentiment of the <DATE>18th century</DATE> , sexism indeed exists in society still , and these discriminatory notions may very well live on today in some people 's minds . 
There is no concrete evidence proving discrimination in the field of philosophy , but the statistics aforementioned , in addition to the several recent alleged sexual assaults , lead to the conclusion that women studying philosophy are indeed feeling uncomfortable and mistreated . 
The philosophy departments at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Colorado</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>the University of Miami</ORGANIZATION> should therefore reevaluate their structure and work to incorporate women and to make female students feel like they are safe to explore philosophical questions . 
A self-fulfilling prophecy exists that causes women in philosophy to underperform . 
From the overwhelmingly male professors to the large proportion of male students , women can become overwhelmed - a feeling which is only exacerbated by the fear of sexual assault and the worry that unspoken biases exist against them . 
Philosophy departments with large male majorities need to consider hiring and admitting women scholars . 
Many women tend to lean toward more " female friendly " philosophies , such as comparative literature and women 's studies . 
However , women would be more willing to branch out and try other concentrations in philosophy if the philosophy departments hired more women professors , and if the male faculty were more welcoming and respectful of female students . 
Such changes could pave the way for more women to get their doctorates in philosophy . 
It is not just the rampant sexual assault of women studying philosophy that deters women from studying it , but also the feeling of solitude , the hostility from male faculty and students and the bias that appears to exist against women . 
These things can easily drive interested undergraduate and graduate students away , intentionally or not . 
Therefore , as <ORGANIZATION>the University of Colorado</ORGANIZATION> restructures its philosophy department , it should consider acknowledging and abolishing the bias that exists against women . 
Universities would do well to support women with brilliant minds and to instill in them the confidence they need to pursue a major and career in philosophy . 
By doing so , an entirely new perspective could be discovered and a new dimension added to the study of philosophy .
