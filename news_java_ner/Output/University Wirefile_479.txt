<PERSON>Ross</PERSON> , a fourth-year Engineering student , was invited by <ORGANIZATION>MacCracken</ORGANIZATION> to attend the meeting , and was allowed to select another leader to come with him . 
" We met with student leaders involved in student government and prevention programs at <ORGANIZATION>William & Mary</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>ODU</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>JMU</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>GMU</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Longwood</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Tech , " said Surface , a third-year College student . 
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> recently initiated a sexual assault prevention campaign called " It 's On Us " and has been reaching out to various colleges and universities for support . 
" We 've been happy to be able to share the successes and challenges of the campaigns we 'd already launched with the team coordinating that effort , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said . 
Surface said various student leaders presented initiatives put in place on their campuses to prevent sexual violence . 
" We also discussed what challenges and tensions we faced on our campuses in our prevention movements , " she said . 
" <LOCATION>GMU</LOCATION> representatives talked a lot about intersectionality and how to engage all corners and identities of their campus , including male survivors . " 
<PERSON>Ross</PERSON> and Surface discussed the Hoos Got Your Back program , an initiative by <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> to raise awareness about bystander intervention to prevent sexual violence on Grounds . 
" We were asked follow up questions about our engagements with Corner merchants , " Surface said . 
" Many were interested in the idea of giving tools to bars and restaurants in regards to bystander intervention . " 
During the <DATE>summer</DATE> , Surface and former <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> spokesperson <PERSON>Carol Wood</PERSON> established the bystander intervention program , as well as the " Not On Our Grounds " sexual assault prevention campaigns . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition</ORGANIZATION> will work with <PERSON>Nicole Thomas</PERSON> , the new Violence Prevention Coordinator , and Dean <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> in the Office of the Dean of Students to promote the campaign throughout the year . 
Student Council has been involved with sexual assault prevention since concern was raised in <DATE>January</DATE> about classifying sexual assault as an Honor offense . 
<PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said that due to legal reasons , sexual assault can not be considered an Honor offense , but in response , the <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> partnered with sexual assault advocacy groups across Grounds to pass the Sexual Misconduct , Awareness , Reaction , and Tangible Change ( " SMART " ) Resolution , which called for specific changes to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> sexual assault education and case processing policies . 
" At the end of the day , sexual assault has no place at this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> ; and <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> is committed to working with any students , groups , organizations , or campaigns that are dedicated to ending it , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said .
