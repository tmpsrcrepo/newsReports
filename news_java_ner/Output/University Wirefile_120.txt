Your new name is 73645 . 
Your new room is Cell Block 386 . 
And your new roommate is a convicted rapist . 
You can have all this , and more , courtesy of the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Police Department</ORGANIZATION> . 
But wait , you say , do n't I need to commit a crime to receive this wonderful prize package ? 
The answer , of course , should be yes . 
But in the case of the <ORGANIZATION>LAPD</ORGANIZATION> , and a growing number of police departments across the nation , the answer is a surprising no . 
Four officers in the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Police Department</ORGANIZATION> stand accused of lying , fabricating evidence , and falsifying police records in order to " send innocent men to jail . " 
( " In <LOCATION>L.A.</LOCATION> police scandal , 4 go on trial for faking cases , " <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> , <DATE>Oct. 13</DATE> ) . 
This incident epitomizes the corruption that has flooded through the pearly gates of our criminal justice system . 
Racial profiling , police beatings and sleepy public defenders have all become regular facets of American justice . 
The majority of Americans would agree this is a problem . 
A huge problem . 
Yet the incident in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> , and many other recent ones , have provoked no public indignation . 
No protest rallies . 
No overflow of letters in the Congressional mailbox . 
This silence is unacceptable . 
Society needs to stop making excuses , and realize the criminal justice system is not going to fix itself . 
Citizens often think the justice system is not under their control , and consequentially they can not change its operations . 
There are no public elections for police officers . 
Judges usually are appointed . 
Police departments are sprawling bureaucracies with lives of their own . 
These facts are true , but it does not mean the public does not have power over the justice system . 
Ultimately , all governmental appointments can be traced back to an elected official . 
People can write their representative or governor and let elected officials know corruption is an issue . 
Representatives can enact legislation that provides for checks on police abuse . 
Governors can appoint judges who are strong advocates of procedural rights . 
Elected officials can enforce responsibility . 
Elected officials only will do this , however , if they know the issue is important to their constituents . 
It is the responsibility of the people to make their interests known . 
Another excuse people use to justify their inaction is the claim that police abuses are unfortunate , but inevitable accompaniments to any justice system . 
Officers are , after all , humans . 
We can not expect humans to be perfect . 
This is also true . 
We should not expect our officers to be perfect . 
Errors made in good faith and judgment are tolerable . 
We should not , however , stand for intentional procedural abuses . 
Police who toss aside the truth in order to bolster their conviction rate have not erred . 
They have deliberately broken the law . 
The main reason for the public 's inaction , however , is not a consideration for the moral fallibility of police officers . 
It is pure selfishness . 
The abuses of the criminal justice system are directed at one demographic -- poor minorities . 
The <ORGANIZATION>LAPD</ORGANIZATION> incident occurred within their <ORGANIZATION>Rampart Division</ORGANIZATION> -- a unit that operates in a neighborhood of lower class immigrants . 
Middle - and upper-class citizens generally do not have to worry about police officers planting drugs in their cars . 
Nor do they have to worry about inept public defenders botching their cases . 
Most people , in fact , can rest assured that they will not be wrongly imprisoned . 
The problem of police corruption is therefore neither a pressing concern , nor an issue for public outrage . 
There are numerous reasons , however , why it should be a pressing concern for all citizens , and not just the citizens who are targeted . 
Justice should be blind . 
Innocent men should be free . 
Police are supposed to protect and serve . 
Poor minorities have few political or economic resources in which to respond to the abuses . 
Americans pride themselves on living in the land of the free . 
Yet , citizens sit idly by , watching as the government robs citizens of their freedom . 
Corrupt police officers are imprisoning innocent people . 
You are paying their salaries . 
You are involved . 
Stop deflecting responsibility . 
Speak out on behalf of those who do not have the resources to be heard .
