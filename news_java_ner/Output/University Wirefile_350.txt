In the quiet coal-mining town of <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION> , W.Va. , there 's a gravel road that leads to a little white , ramshackle shed ; to <PERSON>Megan Williams</PERSON> , it was a makeshift torture chamber . 
For a week -- an entire week -- 20-year-old <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> was sexually assaulted , scalded with hot water , beaten and forced to eat rat feces . 
She was held captive there by six adults , men and women , two of whom were mother and daughter , all of whom were white . 
<ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> is black . 
Throughout the unconscionable experience , <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> was taunted with racial slurs and told she was going to be hanged , according to her statement to the police . 
It is hard to fathom such cruelty . 
It is even harder for the black population in <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION> to go to sleep at night , wondering if they will be the next victims . 
More than anything , they are wondering why the rest of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> does n't seem to really care all that much . 
This crime happened a little over a month ago , and media such as <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> carried a few stories about it , but somehow most of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has yet to have a real discussion about what happened . 
To most , the name " <PERSON>Megan Williams</PERSON> " bears no significance . 
What about the name " <PERSON>Natalee Holloway</PERSON> ? " 
Any news-literate person can immediately summon the image of the all-American young woman with flowing golden hair who vanished in <LOCATION>Aruba</LOCATION> in <DATE>2005</DATE> . 
The speculation of rape alone was enough to keep the American public glued to the television , eagerly awaiting any sort of update about what had happened to the young woman . 
That indeed was a tragedy . 
But where is the shock to the conscious , the public outrage , about <PERSON>Megan Williams</PERSON> ? 
Her story leaves nothing to the imagination . 
We know exactly what happened to her ; we can see the marks on her ankle where the knife cut through it . 
The horrifying capacity for human evil is laid bare , and yet no one seems to be talking . 
According to <ORGANIZATION>City-Data</ORGANIZATION> . 
com , <PERCENT>91.9 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION> residents are white and <PERCENT>4.8 percent</PERCENT> are black . 
Imagine the sense of persecution and the fear for their daughters black <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION> residents must feel . 
Imagine the downright rage gripping black <LOCATION>Logan</LOCATION> residents , knowing that a group of white men and women consciously , deliberately terrorized a 20-year-old black young woman for an entire week . 
This was not an act of passion . 
For an entire week , six white people woke up each morning and thought it was OK to force-feed rat feces to a girl . 
Nevertheless , the white world has the audacity to tell black people how good race relations are " on the whole . " 
They insist that these hate crimes do n't happen all that often , and besides , there 's nothing we can really do to prevent random acts of terror . 
On the whole ? 
As if we should resign a few black men and women to hate crimes a few times a year ? 
The " few bad apples " argument fails to allow the white majority to adequately understand the terror that haunts the abandoned country towns and urban streets of today where hate crimes continue to be committed . 
The <PERSON>Ku Klux Klan</PERSON> was smart enough to know they did n't have to worry about persecuting a whole town of black people -- all they had to do was make an example of one . 
One of the clearest examples of racism alive today in this country is the white majority 's inability to sympathize , to feel , for the atrocities committed against their fellow black Americans . 
The media 's reluctant , spotty coverage aids and abets this callousness toward hate crimes . 
For some , surely subconscious , reason , there is an emotional divide in how white people relate to one another compared to how they relate to black people . 
The pain and suffering of blacks does not garner the same visceral sympathy . 
Consider this event the burning cross in the front yard of our nation . 
This is modern <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
You should give a damn .
