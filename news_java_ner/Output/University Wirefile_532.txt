and " What are the productive things we can do now ? "

Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Will Cadigan</PERSON> , co-chair of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition</ORGANIZATION> and member of One in Four , said discussion is important to eradicate sexual assault and violence on Grounds , particularly in light of recent events . 
" We were all really inspired by our collaboration with <ORGANIZATION>Sustained Dialogue</ORGANIZATION> to make this a place where people can come together and collaboratively talk about the things that this issue brings up , " <PERSON>Cadigan</PERSON> said . 
" There have been a lot of protests and rallies , which are wonderful forms of activism , but I think people need a space to come together and talk about these things and have thoughtful discussion . " 
Members of the sponsoring organizations served as moderators for the small group discussions . 
As a moderator , <ORGANIZATION>Firestone</ORGANIZATION> said she tried not to influence the discussion . 
" It 's not my job as a moderator to steer the direction in any particular way , just to keep it along the lines of what we can do as students now , tomorrow , next semester , " she said .

" I feel that it was productive , and I think it has the potential to be the first of many dialogues like this , " she said . 
" A lot of people came out tonight that were really interested and really invested . 
I think it 's great to see so much energy around this very issue . " 
Though only the first of many actions toward eliminating sexual assault on Grounds , <PERSON>Harman</PERSON> said the talk was an important step forward . 
" It 's not like the issue can be fixed in one event or one night , but I think a lot of people started thinking about solutions and things that they can do - and that 's where the change starts , " <PERSON>Harman</PERSON> said . 
Third-year College student <PERSON>Bella Reyes</PERSON> participated in the round-table discussion , and said the event was a way to voice her opinion about issues raised in the wake of the article 's publication . 
" I 've been hearing a lot of different reactions to the article , and I think that it 's important to be part of a mediated dialogue , " <PERSON>Reyes</PERSON> said . 
" A lot of the reactions have been very strong ones and very defensive ones , but this seemed like an efficient way to voice my opinion and come up with solutions in a safe environment . " 
Reyes said her small group discussed topics such as bystander intervention , education about sexual assault and language employed in discussing sexual assault . 
Reyes said she hopes such discussions will persist moving forward . 
" We need a deep culture change , " <PERSON>Reyes</PERSON> said . 
" We need to spread the word beyond this room . " 
Before leaving , students were asked to sign " What Can We Do " pledge cards which read , " I will take the following concrete actions to support survivors and help foster a community that does not tolerate sexual assault . " 
<PERSON>Cadigan</PERSON> said he hopes participants will be moved to continue to make collaborative efforts to eliminate the pervasive effects of sexual assault . 
" This is something that we can and must find the solutions to , together , " he said . 
" No one person has the solution , but if we engage in dialogues , I think that we can really begin to move forward . "
