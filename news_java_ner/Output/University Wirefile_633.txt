<ORGANIZATION>University Contracted Independent Organization</ORGANIZATION> One Less presented the Teach Safe Relationships Act bill with <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Democratic Sen. <PERSON>Tim Kaine</PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Tuesday Feb. 3</DATE> . 
Members of One Less worked with <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> to craft the bill . 
One Less is an all-female student group committed to educating students on sexual and domestic violence and empowering survivors in the community . 
Crafting the bill In an email , a spokesperson for Senator <PERSON>Tim Kaine</PERSON> said the idea for the Bill emerged in response to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students expressing concern over the lack of sexual assault prevention education in K-12 education . 
The spokesperson said these comments were made in the wake of the Rolling Stone article . 
" With young women between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four consistently experiencing the highest rate of intimate partner violence , Senator <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> believes it 's important that schools promote safe relationship behavior and teach students about these heinous crimes that disproportionately impact young people " <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> first met with One Less last <DATE>December</DATE> to discuss gender violence . 
One Less Outreach Chair <PERSON>Alex Pinkleton</PERSON> , a third-year College student , said the group discussion focused on the importance of early education . " 
[ <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> ] had the idea to create this legislation in an effort to prevent sexual assault , domestic violence and dating violence , " <PERSON>Pinkleton</PERSON> said . 
" One Less stressed the importance of early education regarding safe sexual and emotional relationships as many individuals arrive on Grounds without ever discussing consent or what a healthy relationship looks like , even if they have already experienced sexual activity or a relationship . " 
Why K-12 ? 
One Less member <PERSON>Madeline DuCharme</PERSON> , a fourth-year College student , said the idea behind the act is to educate middle school and high school students about healthy relationships , before they enter college , which is sometimes considered a high-risk environment . 
" This means that from a young age people will know what consent is and what constitutes a good relationship , " <PERSON>DuCharme</PERSON> said . 
" It will be a good thing for people moving into college to already have exposure to this kind of education . " 
DuCharme explained one of the major problems with sexual violence is that many students start college without proper knowledge . 
This is especially dangerous because of the " Red Zone , " a period in the first semester of college when the risk of sexual assault , especially among freshman women , is the highest . 
" Students are given a quick orientation they talk about sexual assault , but they 're also taking about their meal plan and roommates ; there is n't enough time to really educate people , " <PERSON>DuCharme</PERSON> said . 
" We need to start education earlier so it is more effective . " 
One Less member <PERSON>Evelyn Wang</PERSON> , a first-year College student , said sexual violence is not limited to the university setting . 
" According to [ the Rape , <ORGANIZATION>Abuse & Incest National Network</ORGANIZATION> ] , <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT> of survivors are assaulted before the age of 18 , which just shows how the issue of sexual assault is not unique to college students " <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> said . 
" The culture of violence begins at an early age and thus needs to be addressed early . " 
Wang said that although sexual education is mandated in some public schools , many schools do not teach it adequately . 
" We do not [ want ] the same to happen with safe relationship training " <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> said . 
" Safe relationship training is only effective if the content of the training is good . " 
The content The proposal mandates educators to create courses that " incorporate elements of effective and evidence-based programs that promote safe relationship behavior " , thus preventing relationship violence among teens . 
Although a seemingly ambiguous term , the Bill defines ' safe relationship behavior ' education as " age-appropriate education that promotes safe relationships and teaches students to recognize and prevent physical and emotional relationship abuse , including teen and adolescent dating violence , domestic abuse , sexual violence and sexual harassment . " 
The bill would also aid local and state institutions in completing Title IX requirements and provide grants for the training of secondary school educators . 
" This legislation would assist secondary schools by authorizing grants towards providing safe relationship behavior educational curricula for students and educating staff and administration about this curricula , " <PERSON>Pinkleton</PERSON> said . 
" Finally , it will require that these educational programs be culturally and linguistically appropriate and be based in the numerous studies about the most effective ways to reduce sexual and relationship violence . " 
The legislative process The Relationships Act would amend the Elementary and Secondary Schools Act . 
The Schools Act is due for reauthorization by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> later this year to include education on appropriate behavior in sexual and domestic relationships as part of already required sexual education courses . 
The spokesperson said the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Health , Education</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Labor</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pensions Committee</ORGANIZATION> has begun the process of reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act . 
" Senator <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> will encourage the <ORGANIZATION>HELP Committee</ORGANIZATION> to incorporate this legislation into the <ORGANIZATION>ESEA</ORGANIZATION> as it 's redrafted , " the spokesperson said . 
" If it is not incorporated in the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> 's bill , Senator <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> will likely introduce it as an amendment when the bill is sent to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> floor for debate later this year . " 
This includes education regarding consent as well as emotional health and well-being in relationships . 
Wang said with a long process of revision and debate ahead , <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> said she believes the next steps of passing and implementing the bill will not be easy . 
Accordingly , she said student lobbying efforts could play an important role in ensuring the Bill is enacted . 
" We will need student lobbyists to promote this bill , and [ we ] will need to promote it all across the country to raise awareness and support , " she said . 
" We need to fight to get this bill passed , and then we will need to fight to get it implemented correctly . " 
Members of One Less said they are optimistic about the future of this bill and hope <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students will stand behind the new legislation . 
I just want to encourage everyone to write letters to their senators and representatives to support this bill , and to encourage their friends to do the same , " <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> said . 
" We all have a crucial role to play in getting this bill passed , and not a single person [ is ] unimportant . 
The bill in action Though this type of comprehensive health education is currently not mandatory in secondary schools , the hope is that such age-appropriate education may lessen the prevalence of relationship violence . 
<ORGANIZATION>Albemarle School Board</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Jason Buyaki</PERSON> said if the bill is passed , <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> members would work with administrators and teachers to decide how to implement it into the school curriculum and obtain funding . 
Buyaki said he is wary regarding how exactly the Bill will be implemented , particularly because it will be the responsibility of each school district to determine how best to incorporate these topics into school curricula . 
" I 'm always leery about anytime curriculum comes down from the Federal government or <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> government because a lot of times they 'll pass a law , but then they do n't send the funding along with it , " <PERSON>Buyaki</PERSON> said . 
" To me , this one may not have such heavy cost burden because you can incorporate it into the curriculum , but we would leave it up to the professionals in the school system . " 
Buyaki said he believes the proposed legislation is an important step towards acknowledging the problem sexual violence , but that it will likely not completely end offenses . 
" A law wo n't prevent violence , but it will raise awareness and raising awareness can help to condemn behaviors and stop them , " <PERSON>Buyaki</PERSON> said . 
" But it comes down to the individual and if the individual is bent on being violent , then there 's not a lot stopping them . "
