University President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> announced the suspension of " all fraternal organizations and associated social activities " until <DATE>Jan. 9</DATE> in an email to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community <DATE>Saturday</DATE> . 
During the period of suspension " we will assemble groups of students , faculty , alumni and other concerned parties to discuss our next steps in preventing sexual assault and sexual violence on Grounds , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said in the email . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> had previously announced all fraternities would voluntarily suspend their social activities for this weekend . 
Inter-Fraternity Council President <PERSON>Tommy Reid</PERSON> , a fourth-year College student , issued a statement shortly after <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> 's email . 
In it , he emphasized a mission of action by fraternities to act as primary agents for change in sexual assault . 
" This is a temporary , short-term action that will ultimately benefit our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and our community in the long-term , not an impulsive move to blame rape on fraternities , " he said in an email . 
" The temporary suspension grants our fraternity system time to develop substantive and actionable solutions for the future . " 
<PERSON>Reid</PERSON> said sexual assault was not just a fraternity problem , but a University-wide problem . 
" At times , our organizations are placed with a disproportionate share of the blame for sexual misconduct , " he said . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> recognizes that sexual assault is a problem in fraternities ; we also recognize that we can be catalysts for the solution . 
Banning fraternities will not solve the complicated problem of rape in our society . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> will also meet <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to discuss <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policy and procedure , as well as the recent allegations . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> also called upon individuals with knowledge about the sexual assault detailed in a Rolling Stone article published <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to come forward . 
" There are individuals in our community who know what happened that night , and I am calling on them to come forward to the police to report the facts , " she said . 
" Only you can shed light on the truth , and it is your responsibility to do so . " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said many members of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community have contacted her since the Rolling Stone article was published , and she said now is the time for a strong re-revaluation of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's policies and culture . 
" Alongside this investigation , we as a community must also do a systematic evaluation of our culture to ensure that one of our founding principles - the pursuit of truth - remains a pillar on which we can stand , " she said . 
" There is no greater threat to honor than secrecy and indifference . " 
She said the email and decision to suspend fraternity organizations ' activities were in direct response to the outpouring of messages she has received . 
" At UVa we speak in idealistic terms : honor and tradition inform our thinking , and balance our daily actions , " she said . 
" And it is easy here , where success is demanded as much as it is sought , to let our idealism outweigh our reality . " 
Sullivan once again asked the fourth-year class to " embrace your role as leaders and demonstrate a renewed sense of responsibility to our community . " 
She also expressed her grief for the passing of second-year College student <PERSON>Peter D'Agostino</PERSON> , " whose passing adds overwhelming emotion to what has been a difficult semester for all of us . "
