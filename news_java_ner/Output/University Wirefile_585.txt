At the beginning of semester , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> launched its chapter of the national sexual assault initiative Not On Our Grounds to raise awareness of the issue and spark prevention efforts . 
Also started this semester was <PERSON>Hoos</PERSON> Got Your Back , a sub-campaign under Not On Our Grounds geared at promoting bystander awareness , especially among first-years , who are statistically at the greatest risk of sexual violence in college . 
The initiative also engages the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> community by reaching out to local merchants such as <PERSON>Mincer</PERSON> 's , The Virginian , <PERSON>Littlejohn</PERSON> 's and Take It Away . 
" We intended for Hoos Got Your Back to be an introduction to bystander [ intervention ] , and to raise awareness for how important bystanders can be in fighting sexual misconduct , " Associate Dean of Students <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> said in <DATE>September</DATE> . 
" We kind of considered it our first step , and our next step is working on developing and implementing some training programs for students , so I think you 'll see more of that coming towards the end of this semester and into the <DATE>spring</DATE> semester . " 
Additionally , in <DATE>August</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> announced a new <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policy requiring faculty and staff to report sexual misconduct allegations they hear from students . 
Employees who are in health care or in counseling are considered Confidential Employees , and are not required to report - though the exact extent of the policy has yet to be ironed out . 
That policy was adopted to help the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> improve its compliance with Title IX requirements which prohibit discrimination based on sex among institutions receiving federal financial aid . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is currently under a Title IX compliance investigation . 
" We believe it accurately reflects the current Title IX regulatory expectations for all institutions of higher education across the country , " Dean of Students <PERSON>Allen Groves</PERSON> said of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> 's new policy in <DATE>August</DATE> . 
Just before the Thanksgiving holiday , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> also proposed a set of new sexual misconduct policies to more fully comply with Title IX as the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> formulated a zero-tolerance policy for sexual assault . 
The proposed policy more explicitly defines the channels through which victims can respond to sexual assault , expands the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's definition of sexual assault and modifies the judicial and reporting procedures related to circumstances of misconduct . 
Board of Visitor 's member <PERSON>Helen Dragas</PERSON> proposed a zero-tolerance policy for sexual assault on <DATE>Nov. 25</DATE> . 
It was passed unanimously . 
" We 're not as good as we should be , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said in her statement to the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Our job now is to channel the energy and the passion into action . 
Together , we need to work together to isolate and exclude any subculture of deviance . " 
Efforts to implement a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault will be in place by the start of next semester . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> also announced plans to improve lighting , bolster security measures and create a police substation on the Corner by the <DATE>spring</DATE> semester .
