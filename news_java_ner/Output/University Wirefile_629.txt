" In this case , first-degree murder and abduction with intent to defile . " 
The case was transferred from the <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Department</ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>Albemarle County Police Department</ORGANIZATION> following the discovery of <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> 's remains in <LOCATION>Albemarle County</LOCATION> on <DATE>Oct. 18</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>Sellers</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" This transition was made extremely easy since Chief <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> requested our involvement in the search and investigation at the very early stages , " Sellers said . 
<PERSON>Lunsford</PERSON> said she could not comment on the details of the case , why certain charges were brought or on the trial strategy . 
" As an attorney involved in a matter that may be tried to a jury , I am ethically prohibited from making statements that may interfere with the fairness of a trial , " <PERSON>Lunsford</PERSON> said . 
Both Sellers and <PERSON>Lunsford</PERSON> said they were grateful to those on " Team Hannah " and for the community efforts in response to last fall 's events . 
<PERSON>Graham</PERSON> was last seen on <DATE>Sept. 13</DATE> , and thousands of members of the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> community came together in the days that followed as part of a massive search effort coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Department of Emergency Management</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Graham</PERSON> 's remains were ultimately discovered by a sheriff 's deputy with the <ORGANIZATION>Chesterfield County Sheriff 's Office</ORGANIZATION> . 
" The prosecutions for the abduction and murder of <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> will bring Mr. <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> to justice for these crimes - crimes that were committed against <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> , against her family and against our community , " <PERSON>Lunsford</PERSON> said .

The delay was requested by <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> 's attorney , <PERSON>James Camblos</PERSON> , who said the defense needed more time to review documents brought forward by the prosecution . 
" It 's hard to say how the cases will proceed in terms of which will go first , " <PERSON>Lunsford</PERSON> said . 
" The two cases are sort of connected because there is the same defendant . 
Other than that , it really does n't matter which prosecution goes first - it only matters that we 're able to provide a fair trial . "
