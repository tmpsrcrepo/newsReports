Kelsey Grant | The Cavalier DailyAnne Owen | The Cavalier Daily In the aftermath of the disappearance and death of second-year College student <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students , <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> citizens and city officials have found themselves increasingly concerned with personal safety . 
The city has responded with new awareness measures , also moving to foster discussion about new safety initiatives which can work to address community concerns - particularly on the <ORGANIZATION>Downtown Mall</ORGANIZATION> , where <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> was last seen alive . 
Safety Concerns Though the Downtown Mall is home to many family - and student-oriented shops and events , it is by no means free from crime . 
This year alone , the <ORGANIZATION>Downtown Mall</ORGANIZATION> has been host to a number of violent incidents , including 72 assaults , 76 drug or narcotics violations and three robberies in the designated Mall neighborhood , according to year-to-date statistics published by the <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Department</ORGANIZATION> . 
By comparison , the <PERSON>Venable</PERSON> and Corner neighborhoods , which include many off-Grounds student housing facilities - excluding those on <LOCATION>Wertland St.</LOCATION> - reported 22 assaults of all types , nine drug-related violations and 16 burglaries in the same year-to-date data . 
<LOCATION>Albemarle County</LOCATION> , the jurisdiction in which the actual University sits , does not maintain a similar breakdown of crime data online . 
In the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's Clery Act report for <DATE>2013</DATE> , however , there were a reported 37 rape or fondling incidents on or near <ORGANIZATION>University Grounds</ORGANIZATION> . 
The report also says there were four aggravated assaults and 59 burglaries in <DATE>2013</DATE> . 
Data aside , students continue to frequent the Mall - though in light of events this year there has been a shift in attitudes about safety . 
First-year College student <PERSON>Sofie Niziak</PERSON> said she is more aware of her surroundings on the Downtown Mall . 
Niziak still frequents the area but is more concerned with safety than she was before <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> 's disappearance . 
" I 'm a lot more cautious and everyone is a lot more on edge , " <PERSON>Niziak</PERSON> said . 
" I would n't want to go there at night . 
Whenever I go to the Downtown Mall I try to leave before [ it gets dark ] . " 
First-year College student <PERSON>Jonathan Palmer</PERSON> said the <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> case was a wake-up call to the realities of living in a city . " 
[ <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> 's disappearance ] made me realize that , after all , [ the Downtown Mall ] may not be as safe as a gated community , " <PERSON>Palmer</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Palmer</PERSON> said it is important to be careful in and around the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> community . 
" If we 've learned [ something ] from <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> 's disappearance , it would be to just use more caution and to travel in groups , " <PERSON>Palmer</PERSON> said . 
" There is strength in numbers . 
Obviously what happened was n't a normal occurrence , but being extra wary is always key for safety . " 
<PERSON>Mike Rodi</PERSON> , owner of Rapture Restaurant and <ORGANIZATION>Nightclub</ORGANIZATION> , has also noticed an increased awareness about safety among Rapture patrons - particularly at sorority and fraternity events hosted at Rapture since <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> 's disappearance . 
" At sorority events we have had since then , I think the students are more understanding when we tell them to stay with their group , " <PERSON>Rohi</PERSON> said . 
" They 're a bit more appreciative of the reminder . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Downtown Business Association Co-Chair Bob Stroh</ORGANIZATION> said he does not believe the <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> case represents a chronic problem in the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> community . 
" I have lived in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> all my life and never viewed it as unsafe , " <PERSON>Stroh</PERSON> said . 
" One case is not indicative of a larger security concern for the citizens of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> . " 
<PERSON>Stroh</PERSON> said <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> 's disappearance has stimulated a greater attention to safety among <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> residents , however . 
" I think the biggest safety measure has been the increased awareness in the community , " <PERSON>Stroh</PERSON> said . 
Moving Forward <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> officials are looking to make constructive changes to their safety policies , <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police</ORGANIZATION> spokesperson <PERSON>Steve Upman</PERSON> said . 
" Frankly , we 're always looking at ways to improve patrol efforts , not only on the Downtown Mall , but also in the entirety of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , " <PERSON>Upman</PERSON> said . 
" We are always looking at strategies to increase our presence and enforcement efforts in all areas of the city when the need arises . " 
Upman said the <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Department</ORGANIZATION> often bases police stationing on the community 's current needs . 
This frequently occurs during large community events . 
" It 's not a hard fast rule - it 's dependent on what 's going on in that particular instance , " <PERSON>Upman</PERSON> said . 
" For example , we always increase patrol efforts on <DATE>Fridays</DATE> after 5 , [ and ] we increase patrol on the Corner when big events are going on . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville City Council</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Kristin Szakos</PERSON> said that the city will continue to improve safety measures , as safety is always a primary concern . 
" In the grand scheme of things , everything needs to be safer , " <PERSON>Szakos</PERSON> said . 
" We should always be trying to make the city safer . 
The Downtown Mall is not one of our least safe areas . 
The crime rate has gone down recently , but that 's not to say that there 's not always more we can do . " 
Szakos said the most important aspect of safety is ensuring <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> citizens feel safe throughout the city , whether on the Downtown Mall or elsewhere . 
" In terms of the perception of safety , a city is n't really safe until people feel safe , " <PERSON>Szakos</PERSON> said . 
" We can spurt out all the statistics we want , but if people are afraid , the statistics are irrelevant . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville City Council</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Bob Fenwick</PERSON> said making changes to safety policies in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> will likely take time because of the analysis necessary for implementing successful policy . 
" Everyone expects a quick easy answer , but these are things we really need to think through , " <PERSON>Fenwick</PERSON> said . 
" We ca n't jump into something quickly and find out it does n't work . " 
Suggested Reform Regarding safety strategies , <PERSON>Upman</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> police are constantly looking for opportunities to better protect the community . 
" It 's a process of analyzing what 's going on , and implementing strategies to address those events when they take place , " <PERSON>Upman</PERSON> said . 
" Any time we see a need or an opportunity to improve the deployment of our resources , we always take that opportunity . " 
Rodi has taken the initiative of purchasing a camera system for Rapture , saying restaurants and other establishments on the Mall should take some responsibility for the safety of their patrons . 
" We 've long had a policy ... of not denying people access just because they 're intoxicated , " <PERSON>Rodi</PERSON> said . 
" We wo n't serve them , but it 's always been my belief that you ca n't just let someone who might not be familiar with the area go wandering off . 
I think we need to take some responsibility for that . " 
As a part of that philosophy , staff is also trained to be aware of the status of their patrons , <PERSON>Rodi</PERSON> said . 
" We continue to train bartenders to look for people that may be over-served or that have ingested some sort of narcotic , " <PERSON>Rodi</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Stroh</PERSON> said he hopes <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> will implement long-term safety measures to create a more secure environment on the Downtown Mall . 
" The one thing that we are looking to create is a system with better cameras and better access , " <PERSON>Stroh</PERSON> said . 
" The footage that was captured on the <TIME>night</TIME> of <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> 's disappearance was the result of the <ORGANIZATION>Downtown Business Association</ORGANIZATION> asking its members to create a private system of security cameras . " 
Installing the cameras is ultimately a decision made by the <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville City Council</ORGANIZATION> . 
" There has been some discussion about cameras on the <ORGANIZATION>Downtown Mall</ORGANIZATION> , which [ Chief ] <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> brought up in <DATE>2007</DATE> , " <PERSON>Upman</PERSON> said . 
" There are ongoing discussions about those , but nothing has been decided at this point . " 
<ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> is open to any suggestions regarding how to improve safety on the Downtown Mall . 
Recently , the <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Youth Council</ORGANIZATION> suggested the implementation of a blue light system - similar to the system on Grounds - on the Mall . 
" We were n't considering [ the blue light system ] before they brought it forward , but they have moved the conversation in that direction " <PERSON>Szakos</PERSON> said . 
" I think it 's great that it 's another tool in the toolbox that we can use . "
