The <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> is off " immediate jeopardy " status after being evaluated this week to determine if hospital administrators have corrected deficiencies in psychiatric patient care . 
The ward attracted attention after a patient care assistant was arrested for allegedly raping two patients . 
Inspectors representing the <ORGANIZATION>Centers</ORGANIZATION> for Medicare and <ORGANIZATION>Medicaid Services</ORGANIZATION> began their evaluation <DATE>Monday</DATE> . 
<ORGANIZATION>CMS</ORGANIZATION> conducted the investigation after an early <DATE>June</DATE> examination claimed that the hospital " does not have a policy in place to protect patients from abuse . " 
<ORGANIZATION>CMS</ORGANIZATION> officials initiated the investigation following reports in <DATE>April</DATE> and <DATE>May</DATE> that three female patients were sexually assaulted while in the hospital 's psychiatric ward . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> police department charged former hospital employee <PERSON>Rudolph T. Johnson Jr.</PERSON> with two of the assaults . 
The report also found that psychiatric ward restraints were being used improperly . 
The deficiencies in restraint use were unrelated to the sexual assaults . 
<ORGANIZATION>CMS</ORGANIZATION> gave the hospital until <DATE>July 3</DATE> to correct problems before the medical center would face the possibility of losing its Medicare payment option , which accounted for <MONEY>$ 230 million</MONEY> last near , nearly <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of its revenue . 
Medicare patients also would have seen a break in coverage for treatment if the medical center officials did not make improvements by the deadline . 
" We are pleased that the immediate jeopardy status has been removed , " said <PERSON>Leonard W. Sandridge</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president and chief operating officer . 
Last week hospital officials submitted a correctional plan to <ORGANIZATION>CMS</ORGANIZATION> , which would include increasing security camera use on the psychiatric ward , better restraint training for hospital staff and improving the screening process for hiring new employees . 
The plan " constitutes the medical center 's creditable allegation that the jeopardy to patient health and safety ... has been removed , " said <PERSON>William E. Carter Jr.</PERSON> , chief operating officer for the medical center , in a letter to <ORGANIZATION>CMS</ORGANIZATION> dated <DATE>June 21</DATE> . 
" We will not be satisfied until we have met the expectations of <ORGANIZATION>CMS</ORGANIZATION> on all fronts , " <PERSON>Sandridge</PERSON> said . 
" We are expanding our internal education efforts , instituting new review practices and carefully monitoring all that we do . " 
" We believe the changes we have instituted are strong and specific and hope that our commitment to delivering the highest quality health care will be evident to the community , " <PERSON>Sandridge</PERSON> added . 
The medical center still is facing a lawsuit from six former employees who were fired after <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> 's <DATE>May 15</DATE> arrest .
