<PERSON>John Pappas</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily Various</ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community spoke on issues pertaining to sexual assault . 
Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> held its annual vigil <DATE>Thursday</DATE> as the culmination of its week-long campaign to combat and raise awareness about sexual assault and misconduct . 
The vigil opened with a song by the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Women 's Chorus as well as a performance by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> a cappella group the <ORGANIZATION>Academical Village People</ORGANIZATION> . 
Survivors then had the opportunity to come forward , either anonymously or not , to share their personal stories in front of the community . 
<PERSON>Amelia Nemitz</PERSON> , Take Back the Night co-chair for the vigil , said the event is above all focused on establishing a system of support . 
" The vigil provides a safe and anonymous space for survivors of sexual violence to share their stories with the community , " <PERSON>Nemitz</PERSON> said . 
" It [ also ] gives the community a chance to provide their support and learn more about the issue . " 
Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> also works in coordination with the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Resource Agency</ORGANIZATION> , which provides advocates each year to support speakers and audience members who wish to receive counsel . 
<PERSON>Erica Robertson</PERSON> , major events chair for the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition</ORGANIZATION> , said the event is one of the most emotional and engaging of the week-long campaign . 
SVPC is the umbrella organization which brings together various advocacy groups on grounds , such as One Less and One in Four . 
" It 's one of many events that we have during the week - but I think it 's one of the most touching and empowering because it 's very personal and you feel that connection even if you do n't know who it is , " <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> said . 
Survivors who chose to speak at the event had the option to do so either from within or outside a covered tent to preserve anonymity . 
SARA and Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> volunteers also offered to read any stories should an individual not feel comfortable speaking up by him - or herself . 
<PERSON>Nemitz</PERSON> said she is amazed by the courage of those who come forward to speak and grateful for the support the vigil itself provides . 
" We just want to offer a big thank you to all the survivors to those in the audience and those who speak , " <PERSON>Nemitz</PERSON> said . 
" We really admire their courage in coming forward and again , we appreciate the audience especially because their support is really crucial for us to create the community of support for survivors at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . " 
First-year College student <PERSON>Madi Baril</PERSON> , a member of the Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night Open Arts Board</ORGANIZATION> , said she believes having the vigil is especially important for the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> this year . 
" The events that have happened [ on Grounds this semester ] ... have only been brief moments of awareness , " <PERSON>Baril</PERSON> said . 
" Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> is supporting a movement that is sustainable , and to come out and support actual survivors rather than the idea of survivors is really important to me . " 
<PERSON>Baril</PERSON> said the vigil itself is both hopeful and heartbreaking for her . 
" It felt really heavy and I 'm actually kind of scared that this is something that happens so frequently , " <PERSON>Baril</PERSON> said . 
" Even though I 've read so much about it and tried to keep informed its terrifying to think that sexual assault happens to one in four women on college campuses . " 
Baril also stressed the overall message of hope and support the vigil sends to the community , not only for survivors , but for allies as well . 
" I think it was very powerful evening for everybody , " <PERSON>Baril</PERSON> said . 
" I really hope those messages reach all those people who they were supposed to meet , including supporters and survivors and also perpetrators . "
