<DATE>July 17</DATE> , the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> put itself in less than desirable company , voting with the likes of <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> against the formation of the <ORGANIZATION>Worldwide War Crimes High Court</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> 's refusal to sanction the court leaves the world to question why the land of the free and the home of the brave fears the presence of a court formed to prosecute the worst of human behavior . 
It would be naive to claim that this decision to reject the court transpired in a political vacuum . 
<ORGANIZATION>Senate Foreign Relations</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Jesse Helms</PERSON> already informed the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> Administration that the warcrimes court charter as it stands would never gain his committee 's approval . 
At the core of that rejection is <PERSON>Helms</PERSON> 's and others ' fear that the court 's independent prosecutor , who can bring cases to the court unilaterally , would have too much power and would bring frivilous or trumped-up charges against American troops stationed abroad . 
The words " independent prosecutor " also probably struck fear in the hearts of the <ORGANIZATION>Administration</ORGANIZATION> , knowing the record of such officials in this country presently . 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is afraid that an overzealous prosecutor , perhaps from a country not politically friendly , will attack American troop deployment in foreign lands rather than prosecute actual war crimes . 
But the government has yet to explain fully this fear , nor has it explained why the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is willing to go this battle alone , ignoring the overwhelming support the court received from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and every other major ally . 
What 's going on here really ? 
For centuries , the sight of an armed man in uniform entering a village sent terror into the hearts of the civilians living there . 
Armies did n't liberate towns . 
They raped and pillaged them . 
All this changed 50 years ago when the <LOCATION>G.I.</LOCATION> became not the symbol of fear , but the paradigm of mercy . 
The American fighting man represented all the hope and justice that his home nation stood for . 
Apparently , this is n't true anymore . 
In <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> , the conduct of American forces brought shame to this nation and death to thousands of civilians . 
Yankees were monsters instead of liberators . 
In today 's wars fought not against <ORGANIZATION>Nazis</ORGANIZATION> but against shabbily-dressed teenagers with AK-47s , the battlefield gets very confusing . 
Suddenly , with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government sending its boys overseas to fight politically-motivated wars , the American soldier has become susceptable to horrendous losses of discipline . 
For the first time in a century , he too has committed war crimes . 
It would be understandable for the <ORGANIZATION>Administration</ORGANIZATION> to protect the <LOCATION>G.I.</LOCATION> model soldier from prosecution . 
But if our soldiers are committing war crimes , why should n't they be subject to the same standards to which we now hold other nations ' troops . 
Perhaps the <ORGANIZATION>Administration</ORGANIZATION> has another ulterior motive . 
There have been reports , largely from alternative news sources , that American troops in <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> fired indiscrimantly on Somali civilians during a fierce battle in <LOCATION>Mogadishu</LOCATION> , killing scores . 
Much of the media coverage of the event took place in between stages of the battle , and only recorded the shocking scenes of Somalis dragging dead American soldiers through the streets with ropes . 
Perhaps these reports will prove false . 
But remember that it took several years for the My Lai massacare to become public during the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War . 
If Americans did slaughter civilians maliciously , however , then why are they any better than the Serbs or Rwandans the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> seeks to prosecute now ? 
" Because they are Americans , " is not a good enough answer . 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> can not have its cake and eat it too if it expects the world to respect its views on human rights . 
If we intend to prosecute those who reflect the worst of human behavior , we should do so , regardless of whose side they are on , or whose flag they salute . 
Perhaps the embarassment of having a few Americans convicted as war criminals will make this nation reconsider the spirit of some of its international deployments . 
The death knells of the Cold War have not brought the end of an imperialist slant to our foreign engagements . 
We have fought to reinstall a puppet president in <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION> , battled the Iraqis for oil reserves and muttled around <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> in the hopes of bringing " democracy " to a nation that has never seen it . 
Accepting a new spirit of internationalism may put smiles back on civilians ' faces when they see an American in uniform and civility back in American foreign policy .
