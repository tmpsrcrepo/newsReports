For the past two weeks , the topic of sexual assault at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has plagued <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> 's meetings -- discussion that is prompting members to take an active role in ending the silence surrounding the issue . 
Since the school year 's beginning , <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> members have said they are aware of alleged sexual assaults occurring at <ORGANIZATION>University Hall</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Rugby Road</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Culbreth Theater</ORGANIZATION> , Emmet Street , Wertland Street , Lambeth Field and at other locations within the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's immediate vicinity . 
Most recently , for example , a female student last month claimed she was confronted by an assailant in a ski mask while walking from her car in the U-Hall parking lot . 
While the student got away unharmed , <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> members are concerned that if further actions are not taken to ensure safety around Grounds , more assaults likely will occur and remain unreported . 
" A lot of assaults occur at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> that get reported but are never talked about , " said <PERSON>Dan Soschin</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> vice president for administration . 
" I think there should be some way of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> announcing it when assaults occur so students are n't blind to the issues . " 
Soschin said he thinks <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> officials can do more to prevent incidents of sexual assault . 
" I think the primary problem is that it seems that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is not actively doing anything to address the issue , " he said . 
" Education only reaches those who are willing to listen , not the ones who really need to be educated . " 
Other Council members said they agreed they would like to see more effort put forth by <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administrators to create an atmosphere where students feel safe . 
" I think [ Council would ] like to see a more pro-active stance taken by the administration , not to say they are n't already working on this issue , " Council Executive Vice President <PERSON>Howard Foard III</PERSON> said . 
" But there needs to be more discussion about [ the occurrence of sexual assault ] at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . " 
Foard said <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> members would like to work more closely with the <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Students Office</ORGANIZATION> to foster an environment in which students feel comfortable talking about sexual assault . 
Assoc. Dean of Students <PERSON>Shamim Sisson</PERSON> visited <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> 's meeting last week to inform members of her efforts in the area of sexual assault . 
" In <DATE>1990</DATE> , I did a comprehensive assessment of where the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> stood as compared to other schools , " <PERSON>Sisson</PERSON> said at the meeting . 
At that time , she said , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> was deficient in its crisis response system and in the coordination of its educational services . 
Since then , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has been striving to improve these entities . 
For instance , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> contributes <MONEY>$ 16,000</MONEY> a year to S.A.R.A. , a resource for sexual assault victims . 
She was unavailable for further comment yesterday . 
Soschin , who is the director of the <ORGANIZATION>Student Escort Service</ORGANIZATION> , said the demand for <ORGANIZATION>the Service</ORGANIZATION> has tripled since this time last year . 
" Students now feel so unsafe that they wo n't walk home from anywhere , " he said . 
" But the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> still says no to 24-hour bus service and they say no to more money for <ORGANIZATION>Student Escort Service</ORGANIZATION> . 
" This is clearly a case of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> wanting something [ to happen ] but not taking action , " he added . 
Soschin said the 24-hour bus service would benefit students by decreasing the likelihood of sexual assaults occurring late at night . 
" All we need is a few buses and a few drivers , " he said . 
" If U.Va . 
and the administration feel this is a necessary service , they can come up with the money . " 
Women 's Center Director <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> said she agreed with <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> in its concern about the naivety surrounding sexual assault and would like to see more people get involved . 
She said safety is an issue that concerns all members of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community : students , faculty and administrators . 
" Professors could be talking to students about these issues during class , encouraging them to do research on them , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
" Greeks could be requiring their members to commit to more than just 15 to 20 minutes of training " about sexual assault . 
" They should have a minimum of two hours education . 
This goes for athletes as well , " she said . 
Beyond asking for late-night service , <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> members said they think the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> needs to place a greater financial commitment on preserving student safety . 
" I think it 's amazing how the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is spending <MONEY>$ 25 million</MONEY> on the stadium , and then [ <ORGANIZATION>University Transit System</ORGANIZATION> ] complains there is n't enough money to run a 24-hour bus service , " College Rep. <PERSON>Alexandra Minoff</PERSON> said . 
Council members decided last week to pay <MONEY>$ 350</MONEY> for a half-page advertisement in today 's Cavalier Daily listing some of the areas where alleged sexual assaults recently have occurred . 
" I think the general populous is drastically uneducated about sexual assault on Grounds , " said <PERSON>Joy Hunt</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Council 's Women 's Affairs Committee</ORGANIZATION> chairwoman . 
" I think [ this letter ] is important because it lists the locations of assaults that students are unaware of . 
Council members said their main objective in printing the letter is to make students aware sexual assault exists at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" When students find out an assault has happened in their neighborhood , it brings the message home , " <PERSON>Hunt</PERSON> said . 
Council President <PERSON>Sajeena Geevarghese</PERSON> said she and Hunt would like to have a bulletin board on Grounds with a map showing the locations of all alleged sexual assaults in the area . 
" In a way , students live in a plastic bubble , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
" <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> is a safe place , and students tend to get too comfortable but college campuses in general are magnets " for sexual assaults . 
" I think the main problem with rape and sexual assault is that people do n't know about it , " College Rep. <PERSON>Katie Russell</PERSON> said . 
" It happens to people all the time and the next [ victim ] could be them . "
