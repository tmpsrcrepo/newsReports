At a special meeting on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> unanimously passed a zero-tolerance motion on sexual assault . 
The resolution was reported by national media , including The Washington Post and Inside Higher Ed . 
Passing the resolution is a first step in patching up the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's image , which has been damaged by media reports of the way <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has handled sexual assault cases going back as many as 30 years . 
That is not to say the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> only passed this resolution to make themselves look better , but it remains to be seen whether the resolution will turn into action that actually improves the climate at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
It is unclear right now what a zero-tolerance policy against sexual assault will look like . 
Rector <PERSON>George Martin</PERSON> said efforts will be in place by the beginning of next semester . 
The words " zero-tolerance " may conjure the assumption of mandatory expulsion for sexual assault , but we discussed in our previous editorial why such a policy will not improve the situation at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , because victims may be less likely to file complaints with only one outcome available . 
A term like " zero-tolerance " is emotive ; it embodies a uniform conviction , which perhaps the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> now needs . 
But within that conviction , there must be room for nuance to accommodate for the complexities of the problem of sexual violence . 
Whatever this zero-tolerance policy entails , it is vital that it not contradict the principles of victim advocacy which are so essential to forming a strong survivor support network . 
Fourth-year College student and President of One Less <PERSON>Ashley Brown</PERSON> said she expects from the administration " The strongest support system for survivors . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> has declared what they do not stand for - sexual violence . 
But student are also asking their administration to declare what ( or rather who ) they do stand for - survivors of sexual violence . 
With the passage of this resolution , the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> is pushing back against the assumption that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administration turns a blind eye to the problem of sexual violence , and is asserting that they want to achieve justice in these cases . 
But getting justice involves two major components - the infrastructure which facilitates fair adjudications , and the participation of a complainant . 
For some survivors , going through an adjudication is a component of the healing process . 
Others have to feel like they can stand on their own two feet before they can report . 
The best policy the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> can adopt is twofold : zero-tolerance against offenders , and <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> commitment to helping the survivors regain their strength . 
One potential administrative policy to support survivors we can borrow from the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Council of Chair and Directors</ORGANIZATION> , who suggest providing victim 's advocates and legal council to sexual assault survivors . 
Another policy , which we have already discussed , is mandating all faculty go through Survivor Support Network training to increase awareness about what needs their students might have if they have experienced trauma . 
Sexual violence is a crime against the community , because it corrupts the community 's sense of safety . 
But it is first and foremost a crime against an individual , a violation of bodily autonomy and a denial of free will . 
It is easy for the leaders of an institution to identify what does not belong in the community and condemn it . 
It is more difficult for them to turn to the community members who have been violated and help to restore their internal senses of security . 
From our <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> , we need to ask for both .
