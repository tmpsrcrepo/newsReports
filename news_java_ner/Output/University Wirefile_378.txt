<PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , director of sexual and domestic violence services at the Women 's Center , wrote an op-ed piece last week in which she stressed the importance of " turning the culture [ of the community ] around so that abusers have no way to commit their acts of violence here . " 
The culture of gender violence to which <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> refers certainly bears some culpability in cases of sexual assault across Grounds . 
It 's necessary to understand the nature of the gender-violence culture that exists inside and outside of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> in order to tackle the issue <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> raised . 
This culture stems in part from socially acquired gender perceptions . 
Sexist and misogynistic attitudes arise through socialization , and music is a medium through which gender socialization occurs . 
If you regularly eat at any of the dining halls - or if you have n't lived under a rock for the past year - you 're probably familiar with <PERSON>Robin Thicke</PERSON> 's " Blurred Lines " and <PERSON>Daft Punk</PERSON> 's " Get Lucky . " 
The two songs , along with much popular music , share similar themes of sexism and misogyny . 
The former is about what Thicke perceives as the undefined gray area - the " blurred lines " - between consensual and unwanted sex . 
Throughout the song , Thicke repeats , " I know you want it , " an expression that perpetrators of sexual assault often use in order to justify their offenses . 
T.I. performs the third verse of the song , rapping " I 'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two " and " he do n't smack that ass and pull your hair like that . " 
The latter song is subtler , though no less demeaning . 
The chorus goes : " She 's up all night to the sun / I 'm up all night to get some / She 's up all night for good fun / I 'm up all night to get lucky " . 
There 's no question that these words are objectifying , treating women as instruments of sexual pleasure . 
I doubt that many people give these lyrics much thought when passing through the dining hall . 
But attitudes that objectify women and pervade popular music are often internalized . 
Dining halls are places of communion , places where our community comes together to eat , talk and study . 
Music that perpetuates misogyny and encourages rape culture on college campuses has no place in our dining halls . 
If we recognize the culture <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> discussed as a reality that we must turn around , then it comes as a great shock that we allow music that engenders sexist and misogynistic attitudes in our dining halls . 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> is correct : we can put an end to the sexual-assault culture . 
It starts with putting an end to sexist attitudes that persist in our environment . 
One could argue that removing such blatantly sexist and misogynistic songs from the dining hall could result in a slippery slope of censorship . 
Where do we draw the line when it comes to music ? 
I do n't have the answer to that . 
But any song that openly celebrates objectification of women or forced sex should not be played in the dining halls , especially while our community continues to fight against sexual assault on Grounds . 
When as many as <DATE>1530</DATE> currently enrolled female undergraduates experience sexual assault during their time at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , we must take this issue seriously . 
Problems of sex and gender at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> extend beyond the music played at the dining halls . 
Ending the culture of sexual assault on college campuses is a complicated undertaking ; we must begin with the little things . 
While the aforementioned songs can be enjoyed innocuously , <ORGANIZATION>University Dining</ORGANIZATION> should exercise prudent judgment in selecting the music we listen to each meal . 
I should n't have to hear <PERSON>Robin Thicke</PERSON> repeat " I know you want it " or <PERSON>Snoop Dogg</PERSON> declare " we do n't love them hoes " each time I grab a salad at O-Hill .
