In recognition of <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>John T. Casteen III</PERSON> 's continual dedication to alcohol and substance abuse prevention , the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Education 's Higher Education Center for Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention</ORGANIZATION> will present him with the first <ORGANIZATION>Presidents Leadership Group Award</ORGANIZATION> this <DATE>Friday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> meeting . 
The award was created to highlight college and university presidents who have taken an active role against substance abuse so that they may serve as models to other presidents . 
" The college alcohol issue is a pervasive one that needs to be addressed in a comprehensive manner , " said <PERSON>Helen Stubbs</PERSON> , spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION>Higher Education Center for Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We want to bring attention to those presidents who have been leaders on this issue . " 
<PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> has initiated and supported numerous <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> programs for the prevention of substance abuse , including an increase in professional staff devoted to alcohol and other drug prevention and the adoption of a parental notification policy . 
Other policies include ending re-admittance to football games , deferring fraternity and sorority rush to the <DATE>spring</DATE> and increasing the presence of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> police , according to <PERSON>Stubbs</PERSON> . 
Although <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> said he recognizes that substance abuse problems exist at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and need to be addressed , he added that " statistically , they 're not as big a problem here as at other institutions . " 
Other programs adopted under <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> 's leadership include <DATE>summer</DATE> orientation for parents and students and social norms marketing , which attempts to show students that most of their peers on Grounds either abstain from drinking altogether or choose to drink in moderation . 
" This is the first of these awards they 've given , " <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> said . 
It partially " was a recognition of the things we had done on the social norms approach . " 
<PERSON>Stubbs</PERSON> also commended <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> for his leadership outside the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" One of the things that impressed us about <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> was that he had served as a leader not only on his own campus but also on a statewide and national level , " <PERSON>Stubbs</PERSON> said . 
Casteen served on the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Governor 's <ORGANIZATION>Task Force</ORGANIZATION> on Substance Abuse and Sexual Assault on College Campuses in the early '90s and the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Attorney General 's <ORGANIZATION>Task Force</ORGANIZATION> on Drinking by <ORGANIZATION>College Students</ORGANIZATION> in the late '90s , <PERSON>Stubbs</PERSON> said . 
As far as national achievements , <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> served on the <ORGANIZATION>Task Force</ORGANIZATION> on College Drinking established by the <ORGANIZATION>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</ORGANIZATION> , a federal research agency sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Health</ORGANIZATION> , she added . 
" President <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> is certainly deserving of this award , " said <PERSON>James C. Turner</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> director of student health . 
Recent surveys have shown that the percentage of students who identify themselves as usually abstaining from alcohol has gone up , while the numbers of students going to the emergency room for alcohol-related incidents has gone down , <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said . 
" We feel cautiously optimistic -- as a result of these surveys -- and President <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> 's leadership , vision , and support have permitted us to feel that way , " he added . 
<PERSON>Susan Bruce</PERSON> , director of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> center for alcohol and substance abuse education , also commented on trends in drinking . 
" While the numbers of students who drink is still higher than we would like , the overall trend over the past ten years is that drinking rates have leveled off and may even have started to decline , " she said . 
Bruce attributes at least part of this optimism to <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> 's support for initiating policies and programs .
