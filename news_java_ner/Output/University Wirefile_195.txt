The <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Student Health Center</ORGANIZATION> will continue to issue prescriptions for emergency contraceptives despite calls from <LOCATION>Del</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Robert Marshall</PERSON> R-Manassas urging the Center to discontinue prescribing the medication . 
<ORGANIZATION>James Madison University 's Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> voted <DATE>Friday</DATE> to prohibit the distribution of the medicine , commonly referred to as the " morning after pill , " at the school 's student health center . 
A letter from <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION>JMU</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Linwood H. Rose</PERSON> prompted the decision . 
" I do n't see why we have to subsidize something some social engineer feels is good , " <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> said . 
" We need limits . 
We do n't subsidize body piercing for college students . " 
<PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> also recently sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>John T. Casteen III</PERSON> and said he plans to write similar letters to all <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> colleges and universities that make such drugs available to their students . 
" Parents do not send their children to college to engage in this sort of activity , " <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> 's letter and the decision by the <ORGANIZATION>JMU Board</ORGANIZATION> , however , will have no impact on <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policies or the process of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policymaking , according to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and student health officials . 
" We do n't act on delegates writing letters , " <ORGANIZATION>University Board</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>William Goodwin</PERSON> said . 
He asserted the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> only makes decisions after careful consideration and discussion , not at the prompting of a state elected official . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University Student Health Center</ORGANIZATION> has provided prescriptions for emergency contraceptives , which can be filled at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> pharmacy , since <DATE>1988</DATE> , said <PERSON>Christine Peterson</PERSON> , director of gynecology at <ORGANIZATION>Student Health</ORGANIZATION> . 
The cost of the medication is not subsidized by public funds . 
<PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> said about 200 students enter the center annually in need of the pill , a rate that has stayed constant for the last five years . 
Occasionally cases involve acquaintance rape or sex while intoxicated in which the issue of consent is uncertain . 
However , a majority of cases result because other forms of birth control may have failed , such as a condom breaking or falling off , <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> said . 
She said she believes university or college officials are out of place when trying to intervene in medical decisions . 
" I was very disappointed a board of visitors would see fit to interfere with medical practice , " <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> said . 
" It 's imposing a religious viewpoint on medical practices " <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> said she thought a ban by the <ORGANIZATION>University Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> , similar to ban on the <LOCATION>Harrisonburg</LOCATION> campus , is highly unlikely . 
Only through a gross over-extension of its powers would the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> be able to enact such a change since the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> pharmacy is a fully licensed pharmacy attached to the <ORGANIZATION>University Hospital</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Lauren Russo</PERSON> , vice president <ORGANIZATION>National Organization for Women</ORGANIZATION> at U.Va , said <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> 's demand and the <ORGANIZATION>JMU Board</ORGANIZATION> 's decision show a lack of concern for the well-being of students . 
" It is problematic for the [ JMU ] <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> to take a political issue and transform it into one that deals with an individual 's health and their healthcare choices , " <PERSON>Russo</PERSON> said . 
Russo also said she fears further restrictions on other health options for women , part of a broader reproach on women 's health that <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> 's insistence demonstrates . 
" If he wants to outlaw this type of birth control , then what is next ? 
Regular birth control ? " 
<PERSON>Russo</PERSON> said . 
" That 's scary . "
