Flickr Commons A former student from <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Wesleyan College</ORGANIZATION> is filing a lawsuit against the school for allowing her sexual assailant to transfer to another university without having an expulsion on his record after he was found guilty by a Title IX hearing administered by the school . 
The student is pressing charges anonymously under the name <PERSON>Jane Doe</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>Norfolk Circuit Court</ORGANIZATION> regarding her <DATE>2012</DATE> assault . 
<ORGANIZATION>Virginia Wesleyan College</ORGANIZATION> has said it will fight the allegations . 
A <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student in the midst of a sexual misconduct disciplinary process could potentially leave and enroll at another institution , <ORGANIZATION>Associate Dean of Students Nicole Eramo</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" We have no way of preventing that , but we can continue to pursue the case in their absence and prevent their return to U.Va . 
until there is a finding in their case , " <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> said in an email . 
Eramo said after <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> carries out an investigation , a student found responsible for disciplinary charges would have that reflected on his or her official transcript . 
" Most institutions ask on a transfer application if a student has ever been subject to discipline by their prior institution , " <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> said . 
" If they answer ' yes , ' the institution is asked for more information about the charges in order to consider the transfer application further . " 
According to the <LOCATION>Virginia Wesleyan</LOCATION> student 's charges , the assault occurred after one of her peer advisors invited her to an on-campus party three days into her freshman orientation . 
The female student said she did not drink much at the party , and believes someone put drugs in hers and other girls ' drinks . 
According to the lawsuit , she was violently raped while attempting to walk home from the party and left " bruised and bloodied . " 
The student said neither the nurse nor the school counselor she met with a few weeks after the assault provided any information on how to report the rape to the school or to the police . 
In <DATE>February 2013</DATE> , the school held a Title IX hearing and determined that <PERSON>Zachary Kane</PERSON> , a lacrosse team member , had sexually assaulted the student , and the school permanently dismissed him . 
Several weeks later , the school - allegedly intimidated by <PERSON>Kane</PERSON> 's legal team - reversed the decision , allowing him to " withdraw " so that he could escape the negative repercussions of an expulsion due to the rape , according to the lawsuit . 
According to the lawsuit , the student is suing the College on three counts : negligence , for the school 's failure to protect her from criminal assault ; gross negligence , for the physical and sexual harm she underwent as a result ; and fraud , because the <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> presented itself as a safe environment to prospective students and parents . 
In a statement from <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Wesleyan College</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> defended its decision allowing <PERSON>Kane</PERSON> to withdraw . 
" We have carefully reviewed the facts of this unfortunate incident and the allegations in <PERSON>Jane Doe</PERSON> 's Complaint , " the statement read . 
" While we sympathize with <PERSON>Jane Doe</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> denies any allegation of improper conduct and will vigorously defend this lawsuit . "
