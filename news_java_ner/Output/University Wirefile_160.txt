The <ORGANIZATION>Golden Key International Honour Society</ORGANIZATION> has not looked so golden recently . 
An internal report , which will be published in the upcoming issue of <ORGANIZATION>The Chronicle of Higher Education</ORGANIZATION> , confirmed allegations of corruption , misallocation of resources and even sexual misconduct that led to the firing of the society 's chairman last year . 
<PERSON>James W. Lewis</PERSON> , who founded Golden Key in <DATE>1977</DATE> , accepted stock from a corporation in exchange for high-level education contacts and admitted ineligible students in order to boost revenue . 
He also made employees do his personal work , including writing his son 's private high school application essays , and engaged in sexual relationships with interns and students despite warnings from Golden Key board members , according to the report . 
" If it 's true , it is pretty upsetting that it is going on , " <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Golden</ORGANIZATION> Key President <PERSON>Doug Myers</PERSON> said . 
" It 's upsetting that is how the top end of it is being run , because it is not how we run the local chapters . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is one of more than 300 schools worldwide with an active Golden Key chapter , making the honor society one of the world 's largest . 
There are between 300 and 400 Golden Key members at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The report was compiled by <ORGANIZATION>Georgia State University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Carl Patton</PERSON> , chairman of the Golden Key board , who subsequently resigned from the board , leaving Golden Key to replace several leadership roles . 
Patton based the report on interviews with 17 employees and an investigation of <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> himself . 
Though <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> confessed to sexual acts with interns and to having ordered employees to write his son 's essays , he dismissed the report and denied the numerous other accusations of misconduct cited . 
" It could give the local chapter a bad name , " <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> said . 
" I hope it wo n't hurt what we are trying to do here in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> ( <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> ) . " 
Myers explained the news comes at a bad time for the <ORGANIZATION>University Golden</ORGANIZATION> Key chapter , which currently is undergoing a period of revitalization . 
" The active membership has really died down , but myself and several other members are currently trying to reinvigorate it , " said <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> , who was inducted into Golden Key in <DATE>October</DATE> and elected president in <DATE>January</DATE> . 
Golden Key offers admittance to the top <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of upperclassmen at member universities . 
Students choosing to accept pay a <MONEY>$ 60</MONEY> fee for lifetime admittance . 
Though meetings have been " irregular , " with most members remaining inactive , recent efforts have gone to aid community service , according to <PERSON>Aaron Laushway</PERSON> , Golden Key faculty adviser and dean of students for fraternity and sorority life . 
" The U.Va . 
chapter of Golden Key recently made a donation to Habitat for Humanity to support the house built by the <ORGANIZATION>Venable Neighborhood Association</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Greek Council</ORGANIZATION> , " University Golden Key Treasurer <PERSON>Jay Rosenberger</PERSON> said . 
" We have a great opportunity to support organizations that are composed of many Golden Key members . 
Over the next semester , we are planning to sponsor a blood drive and continue to support Habitat for Humanity with both financial and labor resources . " 
Myers and <PERSON>Rosenberger</PERSON> stressed the actions of Golden Key executives are not representative of the many chapters worldwide . 
" Despite allegations of wrongdoing among the higher levels of Golden Key , the officers and members of the U.Va . 
chapter conduct themselves with dignity and honor , " <PERSON>Rosenberger</PERSON> said . 
" Misconduct by the leaders of the organization is disappointing , but it does not in any way demean the integrity of our chapter . "
