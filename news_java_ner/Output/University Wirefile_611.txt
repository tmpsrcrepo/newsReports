As the trial of two former <ORGANIZATION>Vanderbilt</ORGANIZATION> football players charged with rape is underway , a long-dormant discussion surrounding universities ' football recruitment has begun again . 
In the <ORGANIZATION>Vanderbilt</ORGANIZATION> trial , defense lawyers have suggested the woman who has accused these football players of rape was involved in <ORGANIZATION>Vanderbilt</ORGANIZATION> 's recruitment process for those players . 
This victim-blaming suggestion has prompted a broader conversation about what , exactly , women 's roles are in the recruitment process . 
Some schools have been known to use " hostesses " to help recruit prospective football players . 
While the requirements of a hostess are ambiguous , they can consist of greeting players , taking them around the school and even exposing them to the school 's nightlife . 
The potential for sexualization of hostesses in the recruitment process is problematic . 
Presenting prospective student athletes with women in an objectifying context only enhances an imbalanced power dynamic between athletes and female students at many schools . 
The implication is that if prospective student athletes come to that particular institution , they will be greeted by women in the manner hostesses greet them . 
This suggestion fuels a culture of male dominance . 
And this culture is not only sexist : it can manifest itself in violent ways , too . 
Studies have indicated student athletes have been found to commit higher rates of campus sexual assaults , and though the cause of this trend is unclear , an inherently sexist practice like providing hostesses to potential recruits could perpetuate this problem . 
Perhaps the most scandalous situation involving a hostess occurred at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Colorado</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Boulder</LOCATION> in <DATE>2001</DATE> , when a woman reported she was raped by two recruits . 
As the case unfolded , documents said the recruits were given " third-party consent " to have sex with a woman , presumably from the school 's athletic department - an incentive for the recruits to attend that institution . 
The use of hostesses in the recruitment process has not dissipated in the years since the <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> incident . 
Though the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> eliminated gender-specific hostess group names - not the existence of hostesses themselves - and banned alcohol , sex , drugs and gambling in recruitment in <DATE>2004</DATE> , issues involving hostesses still arise . 
In <DATE>2013</DATE> , former <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> state players acknowledged that recruits and school hostesses regularly had sex . 
Though there has been no suggestion that these encounters were nonconsensual , such practices can lead to an expectation that hostesses are there precisely to engage in sexual activity . 
These practices send the wrong message not only about a school 's commitment to gender equality , but also about the very purpose of attending a higher institution of learning . 
Recruits should be seeking out institutions that will best match their athletic and academic needs , and universities should be encouraging this type of attitude in their recruitment processes . 
Since universities may be loath to regulate their hostess programs so long as other schools do n't ( for fear of losing a competitive edge ) , the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> should better enforce its regulations on the use of hostesses in college recruitment . 
Doing so would demonstrate initiative on the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> 's part , and improve a practice that can lead to exploitation .
