The defense of our democratic ideals and constitutional freedoms is carried out by <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizens stationed around the world . 
These citizens , as protectors of our flag and Constitution , value the individual rights and freedoms granted by our Constitution dearly , enough to put their lives on the line . 
Thus , it makes absolutely no sense to deny these brave and courageous citizens their constitutional rights . 
Regardless of personal beliefs , <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> has established that ( for now ) abortion is protected by the Constitution , and therefore the 100,000 or so servicewomen and military dependents should no doubt be offered access to abortion in military hospitals . 
Currently , federal law provides that " no medical treatment facility or other facility of the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Defense</ORGANIZATION> may be used to perform an abortion except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or in a case in which the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest . " 
This ban also precludes the idea of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> servicewomen receiving an abortion for which she pays for personally . 
Many , but certainly not all , pro-lifers , in their self-righteous pursuit of morality enforcement , support this offensive ban on the right to choose in the military . 
Therefore , if women require abortions for any other reasons , such as a possible non-fatal health risk , she would be forced to receive care at a local hospital . 
Perhaps this option sounds fair if the servicewomen was located in <LOCATION>Western Europe</LOCATION> , but its plausibility is nonexistent in <LOCATION>Third World</LOCATION> countries . 
Many non-American facilities are inadequate and simply dangerous , or even too far to be reached . 
Also , the safety of the servicewomen would be jeopardized in certain areas where anti-American sentiments run high . 
Obviously , many of our servicewomen are put in a situation where abortion simply is not accessible . 
Whether pro-choice or pro-life , certain relevant facts are unambiguous . 
First of all , the right to choose in <DATE>2004</DATE> is a constitutional right . 
<PERSON>Stenberg v. Carhart</PERSON> ( <DATE>2000</DATE> ) , Planned Parenthood of Southeastern ( <DATE>1992</DATE> ) and <PERSON>Roe v. Wade</PERSON> ( <DATE>1973</DATE> ) all clearly establish a women 's right to make individual choices about her body and life . 
In <PERSON>Harris v. McRae</PERSON> ( <DATE>1980</DATE> ) , <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> ruled that the government does not have to fund abortions , but this case is inapplicable to the situation at hand because the military also bans abortions paid for by the client . 
Furthermore , in <ORGANIZATION>Webster v. Reproductive Health Services</ORGANIZATION> ( <DATE>1989</DATE> ) , <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> allowed the state of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> to ban state facilities from providing abortions , but specifically mentioned that the decision was based on the availability of abortions in private clinics -- obviously , this is also inapplicable , because there are no private American clinics in other nations , and sometimes no clinics at all . 
Furthermore , some proponents of the ban may claim that the military may limit constitutional rights , citing , for example , that <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> sailors are prohibited from striking -- however , this argument is void , because , unlike other constitutional rights such as the right to assemble , offering abortions does not retard or affect military operations . 
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is currently failing not only to afford its citizens their constitutional rights , but is clearly violating its own international commitments . 
In a document labeled " Key actions for the further implementation of the <ORGANIZATION>Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development</ORGANIZATION> , " the United States pledged an international agreement saying , " In circumstances where abortion is not against the law , health systems should train and equip health-service providers and should take other measures to ensure that such abortion is safe and accessible . 
Additional measures should be taken to safeguard women 's health . " 
Clearly , the standing military policy is in violation of this international promise , a promise made on our own free will . 
The issue is not whether choice should exist in general , for even if pro-lifers do not like it , a women 's right to make individual decisions concerning her body is currently a constitutional guarantee . 
Thus , while it is guaranteed to citizens at home , it must be guaranteed to citizens abroad , citizens who are giving their lives to fight for the very same rights . 
It makes absolutely no sense to deprive only our courageous servicewomen and dependents of their right to choose . 
The argument is not against the pro-life stance , which is a whole separate issue . 
The argument is that while the right to choose exists , it should not be outside the reach of those most deserving of American freedoms . 
In the name of consistency , in the name of decency and in the name of the Constitution , the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government must repeal this flagrant attack on the freedoms of our troops .
