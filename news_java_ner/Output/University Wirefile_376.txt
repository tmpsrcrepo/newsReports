The <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> has a problem with rape . 
We know this because of the studies showing that a substantial number of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's female undergraduates are raped during their four years here . 
We know this because of <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Michael Gibson</PERSON> 's emails reporting sexual assaults by a " non-stranger " - a term that almost certainly means that a fellow <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student was the attacker . 
And we know this because of the stories friends tell us under their breath : stories that make us wonder how much goes unsaid . 
Our headline is intended as a provocation . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> can not make rape a single-sanction offense for a host of legal reasons that this issue explores . 
Nor should the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> have jurisdiction over sexual misconduct cases . 
We draw the parallel to illustrate the conflict of values that a continued problem of sexual violence at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> brings to the fore . 
In recent years a contradiction in how the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community governs itself has become palpable . 
We expel cheaters , but we do not expel rapists . 
On our honor The honor code extends beyond the classroom . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's prohibition against lying , cheating and stealing is about more than academic integrity . 
It is also an attempt to fashion ourselves into the kind of community we want to be . 
If we accept an understanding of honor as more than an academic code - if we take honor to offer a set of guiding principles for student life - it is undeniable that rape violates the spirit , if not the letter , of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's honor system . 
Justice requires that worse offenses merit worse punishments . 
And which is worse : sexual assault or honor code violations ? 
Honor offenses and sexual assaults both dissolve the bonds of trust that are supposed to unite <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students . 
But sexual assault damages the community of trust to a greater degree . 
Rape involves an element of targeted brutality and violence that honor offenses do not . 
The discovery that a classmate cheated on a test replaces trust with suspicion or frustration . 
The awareness that a substantial portion of our peers will be sexually assaulted trades trust for terror . 
Sexual assault tends to be a repeat offense . 
A <DATE>2002</DATE> study by psychologist <PERSON>David Lisak</PERSON> found that serial rapists account for nine out of every 10 campus rapes . 
The risk of repeat offenders offers another reason why applying the single sanction to sexual assault would be desirable . 
An honor offense inflicts harm on the community . 
A sexual assault damages the community , yes , but it primarily damages the victim . 
The harm lasts far beyond the attack or the end of a toxic relationship . 
Reports of survivors dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder , depression and suicidal thoughts are all too common . 
By any reasonable measure , sexual assault is worse than an honor offense both for the community and the individual . 
At <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , however , students who are convicted of honor code violations are expelled , without exception . 
Students who are convicted of sexual misconduct are not . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> , which conducts disciplinary hearings for sexual-assault cases , has the power to expel students . 
But the school has not expelled a student for sexual misconduct in more than a decade . 
On this basis , we can conclude that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's structures of punishment are unjust . 
A worse offense does not receive a worse punishment . 
A theory of justice <ORGANIZATION>The University</ORGANIZATION> is not the only school that has a problem with sexual assault . 
Rarely do schools expel rapists . 
The reason , as student sexual-assault advocate <PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> explains in depth in this issue , is a tension between due-process claims and Title IX . 
Title IX , a federal anti-sex-discrimination statute , specifies , as of a <DATE>2011</DATE> " Dear Colleague " letter issued by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> , that the standard of proof in university sexual-misconduct hearings must be a " preponderance of evidence " standard , analogous to <PERCENT>51 percent</PERCENT> . 
But a student - even someone who is accused of rape - has a recognized legal interest in his or her education . 
So expulsion generally requires a high standard of evidence . 
Sexual-misconduct expulsions are easily appealed on due-process grounds because of the low standard of proof and the host of due-process concerns that frequently arise in campus sex-crime cases : the " he said , she said " problem and , in the case of alcohol consumption , unreliable memories . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is legally stuck . 
Other schools are as well . 
Bound by regulatory schemes and a labyrinth of legislation , schools can support survivors in other ways : by removing an alleged perpetrator from a victim 's class or dorm , or enacting a " no contact order " between victim and assailant . 
These strategies are not perfect . 
But they can help reduce the pain survivors undergo . 
Hopes for change Ultimately we must modify the legal codes that pit due process against Title IX to the detriment of student sexual-assault survivors . 
But even in the context of a flawed system , we can work to improve the lives of students affected by sexual violence , and prevent other attacks . 
First , we must find out more about sexual violence at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and devise ways to encourage students to report incidents . 
The two aims are connected . 
The more underreported sexual violence is , the less we know about it and the less help students get . 
Getting at the truth of sexual violence is difficult because it forces us to question many of our fundamental assumptions about gender and sexual behavior . 
In addition , guilt , confusion and self-blame often cloud a student 's understanding of an incident . 
The most recent study of sexual-assault rates at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> is a <DATE>2005</DATE> report by <PERSON>Jacqueline Chevalier Minow</PERSON> and <PERSON>Christopher Einolf</PERSON> . 
Minow and <PERSON>Einolf</PERSON> found that <PERCENT>17.6 percent</PERCENT> of female undergraduates are raped during their four years at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Estimates based on current national statistics suggest that more than 1,500 female undergraduates will experience a sexual assault or attempted sexual assault at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Reporting rates , however , are very low . 
In the <DATE>2013</DATE> fiscal year , the Women 's Center received 20 reports of sexual misconduct . 
Associate Dean of Students <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> , who chairs the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> , estimated in an email that the body had heard just over 20 cases since <DATE>1998</DATE> . 
The problem of sexual violence is in part a problem of voicelessness . 
A sexual assault takes away a victim 's voice and autonomy . 
Encouraging students to report sexual-misconduct incidents and digging up more data about the frequency of sexual assaults at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> would help us better understand the problem we face . 
And if we can better understand how sexual violence manifests itself at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , we will be in a stronger position to enact strategies that reduce the number of sexual attacks in our community . 
Increased information might also help strip away the assumptions - such as injurious perceptions that sexual attacks only happen to certain kinds of people doing certain kinds of things - that inhibit us from supporting survivors fully . 
Second , we must realize that as <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students we have an obligation to assist each other . 
Even the frequent admonition against being a " bystander " does n't fully capture the kind of atmosphere we need to cultivate in order to reduce sexual violence at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
We need to treat sexual violence with the urgency it deserves . 
Doing so requires empathy . 
We must feel our friends ' woundedness , and take that woundedness seriously . 
Only by trying to understand and feel the terror and anger that a trend of sexual violence leaves in its wake can we arrive at solutions guided by compassion . 
Third , we must seek to prevent sexual attacks by challenging harmful assumptions - sometimes manifested in a stray remark - that make for a hostile sexual environment . 
Regardless of how someone is dressed , how many drinks they 've had , if they 've flirted , if they 've kissed you already - everyone has a right to say no . 
Healthy sexual relationships require enthusiastic consent . 
Finally , we can not succumb to fatalism . 
Sexual violence is not inevitable . 
Nor is it something we must endure . 
We can not endure it any longer .
