The <ORGANIZATION>American Association of University Women of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> held a conference <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Doubletree Hotel</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> to celebrate the chapter 's ninetieth anniversary and address major issues , including campus sexual assault , human trafficking and the use of archives . 
In a workshop on sexual assault , students and administrators discussed university policies for investigating claims of sexual assault on campus and sexual assault education programs . 
Many women and men involved in all levels of education attended the one-hour panel along with several students from different universities . 
<PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , program director of the Gender Violence and Social Change program at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , was a guest at the panel . 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said the panel focused on what universities are doing in terms of prevention and intervention of sexual assault . 
" I was talking about Green Dot , one of the evidence-based programs that research has shown works , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
" We talked about bystander intervention , and talked about how when I first got into this work we thought awareness was enough to create behavior change - but it was n't . " 
While the panel touched on the Rolling Stone article about an alleged sexual assault at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , the discussion centered around college environments in general , with representatives from different universities presenting examples from their own campus . 
Additionally , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said part of the panel involved debunking myths members of the panel and audience heard regarding sexual assault on campus . 
" Given there was an age range , there were some myths that came forward and it was interesting having this conversation with people who might have been undergraduates in the 50s , 60s , etc. " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
Many of the attending members held diverse views about the causes of sexual assault . 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said some members had misconceptions about how much of a role alcohol , as well as fraternity culture , plays in causing sexual assault . 
Others said they believed males should not be allowed on females ' hall floors . 
<PERSON>MaryAnn Vega</PERSON> , a graduate student at <ORGANIZATION>George Mason University</ORGANIZATION> , was a member of the panel for domestic violence on college campuses . 
She said the panel was supposed to be run by questions from the moderator , but due to the overwhelming audience response it became more of a question and answer session . 
She also addressed the importance of correcting myths about sexual assault . 
" It is important when we talk about sexual assault , that we remove the rape myths that we are provided through our everyday interactions ( e.g. she should n't have drank , she should have been with friends , they should have worn different clothes , you ca n't be raped by your significant other ) and remember that no one asks to be raped , " <PERSON>Vega</PERSON> said in an email . 
The panel touched on future solutions for reducing sexual assault at universities . 
" Most questions from audience members were how we could change the social climate that rape is happening within and how we can stop blaming survivors for what happens to them , " <PERSON>Vega</PERSON> said . 
" One of the things discussed at the panel is that rape happens even in the absence of substance abuse . 
Prevention needs to start with teaching students what constitutes as rape and how it is not always violent with alcohol and drug use involved . " 
Ultimately , however , the panel 's focus was not on proposing solutions for sexual assault , but rather a dialogue about sexual assault , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Sally Sledge</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Virginia AAUW</ORGANIZATION> vice president for membership and moderator of the discussion , said the attendees were mainly interested in getting a better sense of the issues and culture surrounding campus sexual assault . 
" We learned that there are a lot of resources for students , " <ORGANIZATION>Sledge</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" We could potentially donate to these institutions . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Virginia AAUW</ORGANIZATION> Co-President <PERSON>Patsy Quick</PERSON> said her branch will meet <DATE>Thursday</DATE> to read evaluations from the workshops and discuss the outcomes of the conference . 
" I think we are just beginning to address sexual assault , " Quick said . 
" I think our national association has already addressed sexual harassment as well as sexual assault , and I feel like we will continue to address that . 
It is not going away unless we get a lot of people involved to make a difference . 
It 's a whole culture . 
It has taken decades to come to this point and it will not be an easy thing to fix . "
