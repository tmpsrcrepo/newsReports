The student member of the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> is only as useful as students make him . 
Students ought to understand both the back-ground and the goals of <PERSON>Carey Mignerey</PERSON> , the recently-selected incoming member of the <ORGANIZATION>BOV</ORGANIZATION> , in order that they might better communicate their concerns to the individual chosen to represent them . 
Prior to his appointment as the student member of the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Mignerey</PERSON> exemplified the sort of successful , ambitious student one might expect to take on such an important position as the one he 'll assume in <DATE>April</DATE> . 
As part of his promise to remain involved with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , Mignerey recently sat down with the <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board of The Cavalier Daily</ORGANIZATION> to discuss his plans for the future . 
When he begins his term in <DATE>April</DATE> , he plans to focus much of his attention on four " areas of emphasis . " 
First , <PERSON>Mignerey</PERSON> said , the <ORGANIZATION>BOV</ORGANIZATION> must help the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> grow in size and scope " without losing the benefits we have as a smaller institution . " 
Second , he stressed that the dialogue on diversity should continue , of course , " with an eye towards tolerance . " 
But diversity for Mignerey means more than fulfilling the hollow promises of tired talking points . 
" Students should know that there are schools particularly that often are forgotten and student groups ... that often go unheard . 
These are the groups that would get my first priority . " 
As an undergraduate , <PERSON>Mignerey</PERSON> was an active participant in several forms of student self-governance as chair of the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> and a member of <ORGANIZATION>Sigma Chi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity . 
Upon graduating in <DATE>2004</DATE> , Mignerey worked for the consulting firm <ORGANIZATION>McKinsey & Co.</ORGANIZATION> for two years before returning to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to attend law school . 
Each year , a committee comprised of the heads of certain student organizations and administrators select a single student who " serves as a soundboard for the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> with regard to issues that affect students at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , " to use <ORGANIZATION>Mignerey</ORGANIZATION> 's words . 
This position bridges the gap between the student body and <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> 's corporate governing board with the intent of lending a voice to student concerns . 
Mignerey calls the position " one of the best jobs a student can have . " 
Never discarding his background in business , his third area of emphasis concerned ensuring the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's ability to finance its endeavors . 
Mignerey 's fourth and final point -- arguably his most crucial responsibility -- deals with devising new ways to make the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> safer for students . 
" When I was an undergraduate , " <PERSON>Mignerey</PERSON> recalled , " student safety just was n't a concern . 
There did n't seem to be a problem . " 
Bearing in mind the recent instances of sexual assault and vandalism , he reiterated the need to rethink how the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> approaches safety . 
Ultimately , students must view the student member of the BOV as a " conduit " for their questions and concerns . 
Of all his plans , what emerged most clearly from our conversation was <ORGANIZATION>Mignerey</ORGANIZATION> 's commitment to maintaining an open-door policy with students . 
" Students should be more than willing to come to me and express their views . " 
Well-intentioned though he may be , <ORGANIZATION>Mignerey</ORGANIZATION> 's ability to address student concerns depends entirely on students ' will to engage in fruitful conversation with the representative chosen to serve them .
