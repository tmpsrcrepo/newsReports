Photo provided by <ORGANIZATION>Annie Forrest After Fourth-year College</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Annie Forrest</PERSON> was sexually assaulted in <DATE>2011</DATE> , she Â   shared her story through Project Unbreakable and worked as an advocate for survivors at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Annie Forrest</PERSON> has worked as a survivor advocate and anti-sexual violence activist for most of her time at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Forrest was a first year when she was raped in <DATE>October 2011</DATE> . 
After her assault , <ORGANIZATION>Forrest</ORGANIZATION> faced the deep , personal effects of collegiate rape culture . 
At first , she suffered in silence . 
But more than <DATE>a year later</DATE> , Forrest chose to share her story through the national photography project , Project Unbreakable . 
According to their website , <ORGANIZATION>Project Unbreakable</ORGANIZATION> aims " to give a voice to survivors of sexual assault , domestic violence , and child abuse , featuring photographs of survivors holding posters with quotes from their abusers . " 
When the organization published her photo , Forrest catapulted from silent survivor to powerful advocate with the click of a camera . 
" My mom was concerned about the backlash I would receive ... but what happened when I posted it on Facebook was an outpouring of love , " <ORGANIZATION>Forrest</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" Honestly , I was n't prepared for all the positivity and support . 
It was overwhelming in a beautiful way . " 
Following her public acknowledgement of being a survivor , Forrest became involved with One Less and the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Resource Agency</ORGANIZATION> , becoming an advocate at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> and within the local community . 
Through these organizations , <ORGANIZATION>Forrest</ORGANIZATION> was able to both find a support system and build support for others . 
" Other survivors started coming forward to me with their own stories , [ which ] was something I had no idea would happen , " <ORGANIZATION>Forrest</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" In trying to empower myself , I ended up empowering other people indirectly . 
I realized I 'm the voice for a lot of people who are n't comfortable sharing their own stories . " 
Third-year College student <PERSON>Alex Pinkleton</PERSON> - also a survivor , advocate and member of One Less - works to empower other survivors by sharing her story . " 
[ My own experiences and ] hearing stories from friends and other people in the community made me realize how significant of a problem [ sexual assault ] is here , " <PERSON>Pinkleton</PERSON> said . 
" Advocacy work has been an outlet for a lot of my anger and frustration that I have surrounding the issue . 
I 'm hoping that it helps other people in terms of allowing them support . " 
Forrest , <PERSON>Pinkleton</PERSON> and other advocates at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> have worked continuously alongside the administration in recent years to increase awareness and improve sexual assault policies . 
A recent article in <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> claimed the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> lacks a " radical feminist culture , " which in part , the author claims , led to the prevalence of sexual assault on Grounds . 
Forrest said she disagrees , saying she believes true advocacy goes beyond staging a well-organized protest . 
" I think creating positive relationships with the administration , fraternities and student groups is a more effective way of being an advocate , " <ORGANIZATION>Forrest</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" It 's important to remember to be intentional and purposeful with your type of support . 
In One Less , we try to focus on tangible ways [ students ] can look inside ourselves and see how we 're contributing to the culture and change it . " 
Forrest hopes students ' passion for anti-sexual assault advocacy persists beyond the initial reaction to the recent Rolling Stone article . 
" I really do implore our community to not let [ the action ] stop in the coming weeks , " <ORGANIZATION>Forrest</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" There is no instant gratification - the only thing we can do is start to change our culture , which is going to take a really long time . " 
In the same Rolling Stone article , a third-year student - identified by only her first name , <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> - came forward with details of a gang-rape she experienced at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity during her first year . 
In the article , she describes being discouraged against reporting the rape , as her friends feared social repercussions that might come from outing the fraternity members for their crime . 
Following the article 's publication , many students expressed shock and anger toward <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's friends ' reported reaction to her attack . 
Forrest , however , said this reaction is typical due to a lack of education surrounding sexual assault . 
" People think <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's friends ' response to her assault was unusual , but I do n't think it is , " <ORGANIZATION>Forrest</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" No one questioned my situation . 
It 's not their fault it happened and I did n't report , but at the same time if they did question it , my story may have been different . " 
Pinkleton said a large part of the problem surrounding reporting starts with those closest to the survivor . 
" I think [ many ] times the issue that survivors have [ is ] either friends of the accused or their own friends [ saying ] things in defense of the perpetrator before they come to the defense of the survivors , " <PERSON>Pinkleton</PERSON> said . 
" Now that this article has come out , people realize we do have a lot of survivors in the community that we need to support , and [ we must ] act on their behalf before acting on behalf of the perpetrator . " 
Forrest said cultural change occurs on an individual level - as friends , responders and fellow human beings . 
" I 'd like to see the status quo change here , and support for survivors begin from the first moment a sexual assault happens , " <ORGANIZATION>Forrest</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" We have a responsibility to each other as human beings on the most basic level to take care of each other [ and ] we have a responsibility as U.Va . 
students to take care of each other . 
We can not let it stop after this story is n't told anymore . "
