The Rolling Stone article detailing the gang rape of a first-year student by several <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> brothers has spawned student , faculty and alumni responses to Greek life 's association with sexual assault . 
On <DATE>November 21</DATE> , I attended the SlutWalk organized by my peers in which we marched from the Amphitheatre to the Corner in protest of victim-blaming . 
At one point , a group of demonstrators marched into <ORGANIZATION>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</ORGANIZATION> 's yard to air objections to the Greek system before being asked to leave . 
That same day , Professor <PERSON>John Arras</PERSON> published an open letter to President <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> lambasting the " twisted , misogynist , privileged , moronic culture maintained by our Greek system " and its " alcohol-sodden , elitist , and anti-intellectual " qualities . 
President <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> released an email the next day announcing her suspension of " all fraternal organizations and associated social activities " until next semester . 
And currently , a change.org petition created by two <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> alumni calling for the abolition of the Greek system has nearly 1,500 signatures . 
I take issue with these calls to punish the entire Greek system because the Greek system is not a monolith and should be approached with greater nuance . 
There are four Greek councils at the University : the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Sorority Council</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>National Pan-Hellenic Council</ORGANIZATION> , and the <ORGANIZATION>Multicultural Greek Council</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> does not have a Greek life problem . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has an <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> problem . 
Last year , <ORGANIZATION>Sigma Nu</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Pi Kappa Alpha</ORGANIZATION> fraternities lost their <ORGANIZATION>Fraternal Organization Agreements</ORGANIZATION> after hazing new members . 
The year before , the administration ordered the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> to cut its pledge process short due to concerns with hazing and other dangerous practices . 
In <DATE>2011</DATE> , a <ORGANIZATION>Zeta Psi</ORGANIZATION> pledge was rushed to the emergency room after being forced to drink unhealthy amounts of soy sauce . 
<ORGANIZATION>Sigma Phi Epsilon</ORGANIZATION> 's chapter on Grounds lost its charter in <DATE>2009</DATE> after hazing allegations surfaced . 
In <DATE>2006</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>St. Anthony 's Hall</ORGANIZATION> came under fire after a member inadvertently circulated an email suggesting plans for drug usage during pledge initiation . 
Each of these Greek organizations belongs or belonged to the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> . 
Anecdotally , I have heard too many stories of sexual assaults at fraternity parties on <ORGANIZATION>Rugby Road</ORGANIZATION> . 
And between each of these incidents are likely many more occurrences of fraternity hazing and sexual assault that go unreported each year . 
Presenting these incidents as indictments of the entire Greek system is simply dishonest . 
In conflating the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> with the Greek system , we risk marginalizing members of the <ORGANIZATION>NPHC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MGC</ORGANIZATION> . 
Altogether , they represent 15 fraternities and sororities for black and other multicultural interests , respectively . 
Each Greek organization within the <ORGANIZATION>NPHC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MGC</ORGANIZATION> carries traditions and conventions unique from those shared by <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>ISC</ORGANIZATION> organizations . 
Additionally , <ORGANIZATION>NPHC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MGC</ORGANIZATION> organizations have had little to do with the sexual assault and hazing issues that have plagued <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> fraternities in recent years . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> already receives hefty condemnation for its lack of attention towards black and other minority communities , a problem that my fellow columnist <PERSON>Dani Bernstein</PERSON> recently addressed . 
Attacking the Greek system as a whole instead of the specific <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> fraternities implicated by incidents of sexual assault paints an incomplete picture of Greek life . 
A key component of sexual assault prevention efforts is the notion that each individual deserves a voice . 
To lay the blame on the entire Greek system denies the members of <ORGANIZATION>NPHC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>MGC</ORGANIZATION> organizations their distinct identity on Grounds . 
To qualify , not all <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> fraternity men are to blame for these disasters in our community . 
In an article regarding the problematic structure of fraternities , my fellow columnist <PERSON>Gray Whisnant</PERSON> writes : " The overwhelming majority of fraternity men are not rapists nor would they ever consider committing or condoning sexual violence . " 
Like <PERSON>Whisnant</PERSON> , I do not doubt that most men belonging to <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> fraternities are well-meaning individuals , many of whom are actively involved in sexual assault peer education groups such as One in Four . 
The vast majority of men in <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> fraternities have probably never committed sexual assault or sent a pledge to the hospital . 
But when these disasters do occur , we should be asking ourselves about how the intersection of wealth , class and elitism along with ingroup and outgroup social dynamics in <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> fraternities engender a culture in which such disasters are more likely to occur .
