Many things will be different for first-year guys in the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> 's Kent dorm this year . 
They have a new woman in their lives : She 's their RA . 
" I thought she ( Cara ) was just one of the ( Greeters ) who kept using our bathroom constantly on Move-In Day , " first-year College student <PERSON>Craig Kemper</PERSON> said of the woman he later learned was his RA . 
This year , the age-old rivalry between New Dorms and Old Dorms is overshadowed by talk about the girl living next door . 
This year , three female RAs -- second-year College students <PERSON>Charlotte Hudgins</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cara Coolbaugh</PERSON> and third-year <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Miya Hunter</PERSON> -- will be in charge of halls of male residents . 
Life in <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> residence halls has been changed . 
And it 's all thanks to a statistical glitch . 
" There was a mixup with the number of students " admitted to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , said <PERSON>Sarah Chewning</PERSON> , fourth-year College student and co-chairwoman of <ORGANIZATION>Residence Life</ORGANIZATION> . 
According to <PERSON>Chewning</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>Admissions Office</ORGANIZATION> typically selects a class composed of <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> females and <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> males . 
The residence life department selected RAs in the <DATE>spring</DATE> , anticipating that the ratio of females to males would remain three to two . 
" We made ( resident ) staff selections based upon the composition of the typical first-year class , " <PERSON>Chewning</PERSON> said . 
This year , however , the percentages of male and <PERCENT>54 percent</PERCENT> female , according to <PERSON>Ida L. Wootten</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> relations . 
Because the number of males admitted was nearly equal to females , residence life found they had under-anticipated the number of males who would enroll . 
They had no alternative but to assign three female RAs to male halls . 
" It was weird for the first half hour , but once I accepted it , everything was alright , " first-year Engineering student <PERSON>Grahame Burke</PERSON> said . 
In two of the <ORGANIZATION>McCormick Road</ORGANIZATION> houses , <PERSON>Kent and Humphreys</PERSON> , the second floor , which has traditionally been female , is now male . 
In fact , the bathroom signs on those floors still read WOMEN in bold letters . 
" I remember when I first came in and saw ' <ORGANIZATION>Cara</ORGANIZATION> ' written on the RA door . 
Then there was a Women 's sign on the bathroom door . 
I figured I had to be on the entirely wrong hall , " first-year College student <PERSON>Paul Crane</PERSON> said . 
Crane lives on the second floor of Kent and is one of <PERSON>Cara Coolbaugh</PERSON> 's residents . 
<PERSON>Hudgins</PERSON> , who was notified over the <DATE>summer</DATE> that she would supervise males in the first-right hall of Kent , said she was a little taken back by the news . 
" I was surprised and excited about the challenge -- I figured that being an RA would be challenging anyway , " she said . 
While somewhat nonplussed by the experience at first , <PERSON>Hudgins</PERSON> said she is pleased with her residents so far . 
" These guys are pretty cool and I enjoy them , " she said . 
And the residents , for the most part , agree . 
" Cara 's like one of the boys , " first-year Engineering student <PERSON>Rafael Defaria</PERSON> said . 
Crane agreed . 
" I think she could kick all our butts , she 's pretty buff , " he said . 
" So is her boyfriend . 
He 'd be there to back her up if things got out of hand . " 
Defaria admitted that even though it can be easier to relate to guys at times , he can get good tips about girls from his female RA . 
" I had two sisters growing up , so it 's nothing new , " <ORGANIZATION>Kemper</ORGANIZATION> said of living with <PERSON>Coolbaugh</PERSON> . 
<PERSON>Hudgins</PERSON> has also scheduled activities for her residents focusing on male issues in an effort to connect with her hallmates of the opposite sex . 
She has scheduled a visit with One in Four , a peer education group of male <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students who work with men to educate them about sexual assault , notably rape . 
" I 'm providing information from <ORGANIZATION>Student Health</ORGANIZATION> ( on ) general men 's health , " <PERSON>Hudgins</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Hudgins</PERSON> also described the experience as a chance to learn what guys act like behind closed doors . 
" I 've always lived with girls , so it 's been interesting to see what it is that guys like to do , " she said . 
While sexual harassment seems like a remote issue to <PERSON>Hudgins</PERSON> at this time , she said she is prepared to deal with anything . 
" I 'm a very strong individual , and I think that I can nip anything in the bud , " she said . 
While <PERSON>Hudgins</PERSON> feels confident about performing the duties outlined by the residence life program , she may have difficulty with the more intangible aspects of her position , like forming a strong bond with her male residents . 
" There are three ( aspects ) in being an RA : being an agent of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , to be a resource ( for first-years ) , and to be a friend , " said fourth-year College student and former RA <PERSON>Steven Shepherd</PERSON> . 
Both the first roles , he said , could be accomplished well by either gender . 
" But for the third part , I 'd be a little concerned that I could n't form friendships as well " with members of the opposite sex , <PERSON>Shepherd</PERSON> added . 
So far , though , the situation seems to be working out well for all parties involved .
