--------- Full Text of the Letter : We wish that the recent Rolling Stone article regarding the culture of rape in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's Greek system had come as a shock . 
Unfortunately , as students , we are all too familiar with the rape and assault that is ubiquitous on Rugby Road . 
We have been assaulted , our friends have been assaulted , and the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> -- students and administrators alike -- continue to minimize the problem . 
The administration has consistently failed to take the drastic steps that are necessary to halt the epidemic , and the students go about their lives complacently , tolerating the abuse . 
Rapists go unpunished and wander our campus -- our campus , where they haunt their victims and even openly mock them . 
We are fed up with it . 
We applaud the bravery of those who have shared their stories , and we promise that their bravery will not be in vain . 
This situation is just beginning . 
We will escalate and we will provoke until justice is achieved for the countless victims of rampant sexual violence at this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and around the nation . 
To that end we list the following short-term demands : - An immediate revision of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policy mandating expulsion as the only sanction for rape and sexual assault . 
- The immediate suspension of <ORGANIZATION>UVA</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> chapter , and a thorough review of the entire fraternity system . 
- A thorough overhaul of the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> and the resignation of Dean <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> . 
- The immediate implementation of harm reduction policies at fraternity parties , such as policing , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> supervision , or permission for parties to be held in safer environments such as sorority houses . 
Rape is not a political issue to be negotiated and discussed with an eye towards gradual improvement . 
It is a criminal act of violence that can not be tolerated . 
Inaction on the part of anyone -- students , faculty , and administrators -- allows more young victims to be raped every weekend . 
Rolling Stone discussed <ORGANIZATION>UVA</ORGANIZATION> 's culture of rape , and it is pervasive . 
But we are <ORGANIZATION>UVA</ORGANIZATION> students too , and we reject that culture . 
The silent majority of this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> can not remain silent : change will be made on this campus only if we force it . 
We appeal for action to President <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> , who has shown promise as a strong and progressive administrator , but we will no longer confine ourselves to working through a bureaucratic and ineffective system . 
UVA will not be the same after this -- we will not allow it . 
Sincerely , The students who vandalized the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> house
