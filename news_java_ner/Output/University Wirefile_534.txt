The question comes up over and over again : why do we - at a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> where Honor is the bastion of the institution - expel people for lying , cheating and stealing , but not for rape ? 
In the wake of Rolling Stone 's report of a brutal gang rape , many are calling on the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to make expulsion the only sanction for rape . 
The author uses the word " paradoxically , " to describe the situation : " And yet paradoxically , not a single student at <ORGANIZATION>UVA</ORGANIZATION> has ever been expelled for sexual assault . " 
Perhaps it is a paradox . 
Perhaps the sanctions do n't scale . 
But to use the existence of the honor system and the use of expulsion as its only punishment - " the single sanction " - to advocate that a single sanction be delivered by the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> assumes Honor must be the standard against which we measure everything at this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
And we need to question that assumption . 
The single sanction is controversial . 
Honor recently hosted an event with <ORGANIZATION>Sustained Dialogue</ORGANIZATION> dedicated to discussing the single sanction , and we penned an editorial advocating honor change to a multiple sanction system . 
There is a strong argument to be made that the single sanction deters people from reporting , and may even create a problem of jury members ' unwillingness to convict . 
To establish expulsion as the only punishment for sexual assault would create similar problems . 
Some survivors who file formal complaints want their attackers to be expelled , but in many cases , the personal circumstances are much more complicated . 
Dean <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> , in an interview with WUVA , said she often encounters victims who insist they do not want to get their attackers in trouble . 
Perpetrators of sexual assault can be people you trust , even people you love . 
A single sanction system would be even less appealing for survivors who are not seeking this kind of justice . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> must consider expulsion as a punishment for a student who is found responsible . 
Eramo has said that to her knowledge , expulsion has never been delivered as a sanction . 
And this is problematic for the survivors who want their attackers to get this punishment . 
But former co-chair of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition</ORGANIZATION> and recent graduate <PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> explained in her op-ed from last year that this is probably a result of the <ORGANIZATION>SMB</ORGANIZATION> having to weigh due process rights and Title IX mandates , a tricky legal balancing act . 
" The disciplinary decision to expel , moreover , has to be approached with great caution , because given the ease of appeal on due process grounds and the low ( albeit mandated ) standard of proof , there is a high likelihood that an expelled rapist will appeal , win that appeal , and be right back on Grounds with no chance at retrial ( thanks to double jeopardy ) , " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> says . 
Advocates and activists may have to look well outside the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> in order to figure out a way to overcome this obstacle so that expulsion can be used more often for survivors who are seeking that punishment and in cases where it is warranted . 
But mandating expulsion as the only punishment at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is not a logical solution . 
Such a system may make survivors even less likely to come forward . 
A single sanction would also ignore the reality that there are varying forms and degrees of sexual violence . 
The proposed new <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policy has added " intimate partner violence , " " domestic violence " and " stalking " as defined terms . 
Using the phrase " sexual misconduct " is not - as some have suggested - an effort to downplay sexual violence . 
The term is all-encompassing , covering stalking , harassment , intimate partner violence and sexual assault , which could refer to a range of unwanted sexual contact . 
None of these offenses is acceptable , but it would be short-sighted to assume they all warrant the same punishment . 
One of the signs at the faculty protest <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> read " Women over tradition , " implying that our Greek system and standards of masculinity are rooted in a tradition which we must challenge . 
And that is true - we must . 
But there is another tradition we must challenge at the same time - the tradition of delivering a single punishment for varying degrees of offenses . 
Creating a system where survivors are encouraged to come forward necessitates maintaining multiple sanctions .
