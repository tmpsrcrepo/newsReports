Four years after a rape that made national headlines , 26 year-old <PERSON>Katie Koestner</PERSON> came to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to relive that horrid <TIME>night</TIME> when a college crush did n't take " no " for an answer . 
Katie , a <DATE>1994</DATE> William and <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> graduate , visited the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to help students put a face with impersonal date rape statistics . 
Over 500 students piled into <ORGANIZATION>Newcomb Hall Ballroom</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to hear about <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> 's first college date -- one that ended in rape . 
But she did n't open with the grim account of what happened to her on that <DATE>Tuesday summer</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> . 
She stood confidently in front of her audience and shared her childhood aspirations : " When I was five , I wanted to be a ballerina . " 
And immediately , she made the audience care about <PERSON>Katie Koestner</PERSON> the person , not just <PERSON>Katie Koestner</PERSON> the rape victim . 
The room filled with laughter as <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> spoke about her first hectic days at college , ones which most <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> women can relate to . 
And then she talked about her first college crush as if merely gossiping with a group of girlfriends at a slumber party . 
<PERSON>Peter</PERSON> was the popular , smooth-talking guy she met during that first week , and she instantly fell for him . 
" We met at the trash can " in the cafeteria , she said . 
On their first date , <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> took <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> to a French restaurant and even ordered in French , which <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> admits finding impressive . 
When <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> asked if she would like champagne with dinner , <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> , then 18 years old , told him she did not drink . 
But she concedes that she finally gave in to his persistence . 
" In my mind I had only given in to two sips of champagne , " she said , but added that was probably what gave him the impression that she could be easily persuaded . 
Following dinner that night , she invited him back to her room . 
Before their first date had ended , he raped her . 
" You might think I am the most naive woman in the world , " <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> said to the audience . 
" You could have called me naive if the definition of naive is you think that you can like someone and be alone in a room with them and not have sex , " she said . 
But those who came to hear what <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> had to say said she seemed anything but naive . 
" She was totally not what I expected at all , " first-year College student <PERSON>Josie Richards</PERSON> said . 
" She was really small and delicate , but she radiated strength . 
I do n't think anyone could have walked away untouched . " 
She spoke softly and casually -- but the audience paid attention . 
" She had a fabulous technique and really knew how to use her voice , " first-year College student <PERSON>Emily Harding</PERSON> said . 
" When she first got up there , I thought there was no way she was going to be taken seriously because she had such a little girl voice . 
But she held our attention no matter what . " 
The women in the crowd said <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> gave them a lot to think about . 
" You do n't always think about how fast things can go wrong , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
" I could definitely relate to her " situation . 
Katie has visited over 450 colleges and high schools to tell her story , hoping to promote awareness about the realities of sexual assault . 
And for the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students present , she was successful . 
Hearing <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> speak " makes it so much more real , " <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> said . 
Katie also has appeared on " Larry King Live " and " The Oprah Winfrey Show . " 
Her face has graced the cover of <ORGANIZATION>Time Magazine</ORGANIZATION> . 
And <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> , which took notice of her story in <DATE>1993</DATE> , produced a docudrama entitled " No Visible Bruises " based on her experience . 
She acknowledged that speaking about sexual assault was not what she planned on doing after college . 
But <PERSON>Sarah Curtis-Fawley</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Facts and Education</ORGANIZATION> president , said she recognized <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> 's potential as a speaker when <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> visited her high school . 
" I thought she was a very powerful speaker in high school , " Curtis-Fawley said . 
Since her first year at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Curtis-Fawley</ORGANIZATION> said she wanted to bring <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> here to speak . 
" I think the issue is in the forefront of people 's minds this semester , " she said . 
" It is an important [ issue ] for people to talk about . " 
SAFE members invited <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> so she could do just that -- get people talking . 
Even though you could hear a pin drop during her speech <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> , the silence has ceased . 
Students have been buzzing about <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> for the past couple of days . 
Katie made a concerted effort to include the men from the audience in the dialogue , asking them to all go home and tell a friend the importance of the subject . 
In response to <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> 's emphasis on the male role in curbing sexual assault , <DATE>1996</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> graduate <PERSON>Sean C. Corso</PERSON> stood in front of the audience to support <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> and offer a male perspective about what she said . 
" All you guys go out and tell your friends and frat brothers that this is an important issue , " <PERSON>Corso</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Katie</PERSON> said tackling the issue of rape is going to take a united front -- including both men and women . 
" I do n't think rape is ever going to end by women 's voices alone , " <PERSON>Koestner</PERSON> added . 
But she did not neglect the ladies , by any means . 
She recommended women on Grounds keep talking about the importance of sexual assault education and to understand the gravity of the issue . 
Many students who heard <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> said her words have made them more cautious . 
" She told us to be smart and to keep our wits about us , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
Katie also dispelled the myth that most women are raped by strangers , stating that less than <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of rapes are committed by someone who does not know the victim . 
This statistic surprised audience members . 
" In her speech , <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> said she was more frightened of some nameless boogieman than this guy she was spending all this time with , " <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> said .
