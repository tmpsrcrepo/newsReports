Every night , the orphan children in " The Cider House Rules " doze off to a narration of <PERSON>Charles Dickens</PERSON> ' " <PERSON>David Copperfield</PERSON> . " 
Nothing could be more appropriate . 
If you have n't yet had the privilege of discovering <PERSON>John Irving</PERSON> , you should . 
Every volume of Irving 's canon is full of largesse , plenty of pages , rich characters , an overflow of emotions and yes , a good deal of ideology . 
He has consistently stated that he hopes people remember him as the <PERSON>Dickens</PERSON> of our time . 
Someday , they will . 
" Cider , " directed by <PERSON>Lasse Hallstrom</PERSON> , traces a young man 's slow discovery of his place in the world and questions the true definition of family . 
It comments heavily on abortion , restriction of the individual and our own self-worth . 
Abounding with sentiment and real passion , it is Irving at his most <PERSON>Irving</PERSON> , and , consequently , his most Dickensian . 
Irving 's weaknesses are admittedly as great as his strengths . 
Some people do n't appreciate the uncompromising aggrandizement with which he presents his themes . 
They do n't get it . 
I got " Cider , " and it got me . 
In <DATE>1943</DATE> , the orphanage atop the snowy mountain is the only thing in <LOCATION>St. Cloud</LOCATION> 's , <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> . 
Dr. <PERSON>Larch</PERSON> ( <PERSON>Michael Caine</PERSON> ) , the foundling home 's physician , has watched hundreds of children come and go , and while he has cared for all of them , he feels a distinct affection for the child he named Homer Wells ( <PERSON>Tobey Maguire</PERSON> ) . 
Having learned medicine despite not even having a high school education , Homer performs obstetrics alongside Dr. <PERSON>Larch</PERSON> . 
Larch , in turn , serves as a second father figure to the youth in the institution . 
Life at <ORGANIZATION>St. Cloud</ORGANIZATION> 's is starkly different from anything Oliver Twist ever experienced , and <ORGANIZATION>Larch</ORGANIZATION> is certainly no <ORGANIZATION>Wackford Squeers</ORGANIZATION> . 
The children are well cared for , surrounded by friends and are generally content . 
Homer too loves those around him , but he feels that something is missing . 
An orphanage is n't a place ; it 's a state of being . 
He wants to explore , to find his purpose . 
One day , a young couple ( <PERSON>Paul Rudd</PERSON> and Charlize Theron ) gets off at <ORGANIZATION>St. Cloud</ORGANIZATION> 's station , and Homer gets his chance . 
Abortion being illegal at this time , <ORGANIZATION>St. Cloud</ORGANIZATION> 's is one of the few places where a woman can go for reliable surgery . 
Over the years , Dr. <PERSON>Larch</PERSON> has taken as many children out of the world as he 's brought into it . 
He may not support the practice , but he feels it 's inevitable . 
Having witnessed the tragedy connected with non-medical remedies , he tries to convince Homer that helping these people is the right thing to do . 
Homer , however , disagrees . 
When Candy ( Theron ) and <PERSON>Wally</PERSON> ( Rudd ) come to Larch for an abortion , they agree to let Homer live with them . 
Wally 's family gives the young man a job on an apple orchard , and Homer settles in with the other fieldhands in the cider house . 
When <PERSON>Wally</PERSON> returns to fight in World War II , Candy and Homer begin to make eyes at each other . 
They equally want the companionship - Candy because she ca n't be alone and Homer because he always has been alone . 
Thanks to Candy , Homer gets to enjoy things he never has before , like big screen movies , lobster , and , of course , sex . 
Meanwhile , he gives her the kind of attention <PERSON>Wally</PERSON> never did . 
The medical board , in response to the aging Dr. <PERSON>Larch</PERSON> 's pro-choice views , recommends that the orphanage hire a second physician . 
He fakes Homer 's med-school credentials , and begs him to return . 
Homer then has to decide where he belongs . 
" Cider " sees the beauty in the darker side of life . 
It is about the deterioration of an old soul , about incest , rape , murder , war and race relations . 
The film is most effective when it regards the dangers that exist in obeying society 's expectations . 
The rules that hang in the cider house are irrelevant to the people that live there , and as we hear them being narrated , we see them being broken . 
All the characters shatter convention , committing infractions of adultery , fraud and termination of pregnancy , just to name a few . 
Interestingly , however , the film stays very much within the boundaries ( I guessed the last line 20 minutes into the movie ) . 
This is textbook Hollywood , but under <PERSON>Hallstrom</PERSON> 's tender care , it is somehow resplendent . 
A beautiful musical score ( courtesy of <PERSON>Rachel Portman</PERSON> ) , <PERSON>Oliver Stapleton</PERSON> 's picturesque cinematography and heartfelt performances ( particularly by <PERSON>Caine</PERSON> , at the top of his game here ) convey a tale of infinite sadness and infinite celebration that everyone should see .
