SCREW you , world . 
This is the message that President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has conveyed in his selection of nominees to fill high-level intelligence and security positions . 
In a time when multinational cooperation is essential for our own national security , the president has managed to nominate a <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> ambassador who despises the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> , while his nominee for national intelligence chief is a war criminal . 
<PERSON>John Bolton</PERSON> , the president 's choice for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> , is quite possibly the least diplomatic person in government . 
<PERSON>Carl W. Ford Jr.</PERSON> , who worked with <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> , told the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Foreign Relations</ORGANIZATION> committee that <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> was " a quintessential kiss-up , kick-down sort of guy " who bullied the junior employees and attempted to fire intelligence analysis whose work undermined the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration 's agenda . 
In a disagreement over intelligence , <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> reportedly called a retired <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> lieutenant commander a " midlevel munchkin . " 
<PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> has displayed the same diplomatic flair in his public and private statements regarding the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> . 
He once remarked , " The Secretariat building in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> has 38 stories . 
If it lost ten stories , it would n't make a bit of difference . " 
<PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> 's contempt for the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> is well documented , but even more disturbing is his vision of how the international community should operate . 
After famously commenting , " There is no such thing as the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>Global Structures Convocation</ORGANIZATION> , " There is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world and that is the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> when it suits our interest , and we can get others to go along . " 
Considering the results of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> ' last effort to lead the international community , <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> may be out of luck . 
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> displayed perhaps even greater audacity in his nomination of <PERSON>John D. Negroponte</PERSON> for the new position of national intelligence chief . 
You may remember <PERSON>Negroponte</PERSON> from the Honduran death squads , in which the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> trained Contras to rape and murder tens of thousands of people . 
Although he denies knowledge of the crimes , the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> found that in his term as the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION>Honduras</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Negroponte</PERSON> was actively involved in these covert operations , which included the physical , mental and sexual torture of prisoners in the name of gathering intelligence . 
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> could have used this opportunity to appoint a national intelligence chief who has demonstrated a genuine commitment to multinational cooperation and to gathering intelligence with respect for human rights and international law . 
Instead , he extended a fat middle finger and nominated a known war criminal who is unrepentant about his past actions . 
Sen. <PERSON>Pat Roberts</PERSON> , <LOCATION>R-Kan.</LOCATION> , the chair of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Intelligence Committee</ORGANIZATION> , praised <PERSON>Negroponte</PERSON> 's record , stating , " He has worked on intelligence and national security issues all through his career , and , in that respect , I think , brings a great deal of experience to this position . " 
Americans might prefer to forget that our government sponsored war crimes in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> , but the world remembers . 
When a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> senator praises <PERSON>Negroponte</PERSON> 's " experience , " he is displaying ignorance at best , endorsement of these tactics at worst . 
This appalling nomination comes at a time when the global community has serious reason to question the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration 's professed dedication to human rights . 
After the obscene human rights abuses that occurred in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> , most famously in the <LOCATION>Abu Ghraib</LOCATION> prison , the world has little reason to trust the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration to engage in ethical intelligence gathering . 
Unfortunately , <PERSON>Negroponte</PERSON> 's nomination suggests that the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration plans to continue to break international law in the name of intelligence . 
Having ripped up the <ORGANIZATION>Geneva Convention</ORGANIZATION> , President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is now spitting on the pieces . 
The problem is not simply that <PERSON>Bolton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Negroponte</PERSON> will be terrible at these jobs -- though they will be -- but that their mere nominations represent frightening arrogance and naivete about the <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's role in the world . 
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> continues to behave as though our military strength should allow us to disregard global opinion and engage in whatever destructive actions we deem necessary . 
These nominations will alienate foreign countries at a time when we need them most . 
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> can not gather adequate intelligence without the cooperation of foreign countries , which can choose to deny us access at any time . 
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> managed to bully and bribe our allies into sending troops to <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> , but next time the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> decides to respond to a real or imagined threat , we may find ourselves acting alone .
