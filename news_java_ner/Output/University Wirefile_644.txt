Last week , as reported in The Cavalier Daily , the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia House General Laws Subcommittee</ORGANIZATION> tabled <ORGANIZATION>Senate Bill 785</ORGANIZATION> , which would have protected public employees who identify as lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender who do not work for the state from workplace discrimination . 
The bill passed the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> with bipartisan support before the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee tabled it , making it impossible for the bill to be considered for the remainder of the session . 
This order of events happened to this bill in the exact same way last year . 
A <DATE>2011</DATE> report from <ORGANIZATION>The Williams Institute</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>the University of California</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> School of Law aggregates the amount of discrimination LGBT workers face . 
As of <DATE>2011</DATE> , <PERCENT>78 percent</PERCENT> of transgender respondents to a survey said they had experienced at least one form of harassment or mistreatment at work because of their gender identity , while <PERCENT>47 percent</PERCENT> specifically noted discrimination in hiring , promotion or job retention . 
As of <DATE>2008</DATE> , of lesbian , gay and bisexual respondents to the same survey , <PERCENT>27 percent</PERCENT> had , at one time , experienced workplace harassment . 
It is obvious the problem of workplace discrimination against members of the LGBTQ community persists . 
With no current national law in place to mitigate this discrimination - the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of <DATE>2013</DATE> died in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> - addressing this issue is left to the states . 
SB 785 would address this problem , solidifying in law the state 's stance on issues of discrimination . 
For legislators who are against particular rights being granted to LGBTQ citizens , passing a non-discrimination bill should still not be a question : ensuring citizens are treated fairly in the workplace should be uncontroversial . 
At <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , non-discrimination policies have already been put in place . 
But we can not rely on individual institutions to institute such policies of their own volition . 
Unfortunately , such moves toward an anti-discriminatory work environment require legislative action . 
Even more unfortunately , the current legislature - or at least this specific subcommittee - refuses to take such action . 
According to Metro Weekly , the <ORGANIZATION>House Committee on General Laws</ORGANIZATION> assigned SB 785 to <ORGANIZATION>Subcommittee # 4</ORGANIZATION> , which has previously killed two <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> bills similar to SB 785 . 
While legislators often lay claim to representing their constituencies in their votes on bills , no such claim can be made when evaluating bills at the committee - let alone subcommittee - level . 
Since the bill was clearly not objectionable in language for it to be passed by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> , its tabling in committee is likely reflective of the legislators ' stances on the issue and not actual questions with the bill itself . 
This suggests these legislators stand against equal rights in the workplace for <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> citizens . 
A foundational element of the make-up of our society - state and national - is the guarantee of equality . 
LGBTQ citizens deserve the same legal protection from workplace discrimination as any other citizen ; by tabling this bill , these legislators are denying them this fundamental right .
