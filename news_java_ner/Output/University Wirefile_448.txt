Kelsey Grant | The Cavalier Daily Following the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> 's Not Alone initiative , designed to prevent sexual assault at universities across the country , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> plans to implement a new three-step prevention process . 
The first step in this process is implementing a " Campus Climate Survey , " which is currently in development . 
This survey is designed to increase awareness about the prevalence of sexual assault among participating universities . 
<ORGANIZATION>Rutgers University</ORGANIZATION> is leading the development of this survey and will share the finalized product with members of <ORGANIZATION>the Association of American Universities</ORGANIZATION> , an association of 62 leading public and private research universities in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> , including the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Barry Toiv</PERSON> , vice president for public affairs for the <ORGANIZATION>AAU</ORGANIZATION> , said the survey is focused on learning from students about the specific issues facing their campus . " 
[ The survey ] may help us improve public understanding of the issue of what students ' concerns are and how they perceive the situation on their campus , " <PERSON>Toiv</PERSON> said . 
" It 's very hard for policymakers and administrators right now to have a really strong sense of where this student body is caught on these issues of concern . " 
Toiv emphasized the importance of asking students the right questions . 
" The AAU , as an association , is focused on ... that sort of big , foundational question of it being hard to solve a problem without being certain of the nature of the problem , " <PERSON>Toiv</PERSON> said . 
" Obviously , we know the problem that they 're trying to address , but without having a good , strong sense of that student perspective ... and without asking the right questions , it 's much harder to set policy . " 
Step two of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's plan will be to both prevent and engage men in the prevention of sexual assault . 
The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> 's Not Alone report , published in <DATE>April</DATE> , emphasizes the importance of men in the fight against sexual assault . 
" Most men are not perpetrators - and when we [ participants ] empower men to step in when someone 's in trouble , they become an important part of the solution , " the Not Alone report reads . 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Meg Gould</PERSON> , student representative to the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> , said the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will send out " educational modules " to the students this <DATE>November</DATE> . 
" It 's an educational movement , " <PERSON>Gould</PERSON> said . 
" We 're trying to create a cultural change in our community through education . " 
Gould emphasized that the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> hopes increased prevalence of education on sexual misconduct will encourage students to participate in the movement against sexual assault . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's initiative is " trying to get these types of conversations going , trying to start information sessions [ and ] making them visible on social media , " <PERSON>Gould</PERSON> said . 
According to the report , the Not Alone campaign intends for students to " leave college knowing that sexual assault is simply unacceptable . " 
Additionally , it plans to assist universities in " promoting bystander intervention education , " while also " developing new prevention strategies , " engaging the entire <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> population in these efforts . 
Step three , then , is to " effectively [ respond ] when a student is sexually assaulted . " 
This year , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> introduced a new reporting policy which mandates that faculty and staff who fall under the " responsible employee " category report instances of sexual misconduct to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's Title IX coordinator . 
Though most employees are considered " responsible employees , " those in health care or counseling are considered " confidential employees " and are exempt from the mandatory reporting requirement . 
" It 's not a top-down effort anymore , but an infused effort between students and faculty members to combat sexual assault , " <PERSON>Gould</PERSON> said . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will continue to implement a reporting and confidentiality protocol , while introducing steps to ensure accountability among <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> staff . 
A number of new training and reporting programs have emerged from this effort , including programs for those investigating alleged sexual misconduct . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will also create several memoranda of understanding to send to community officials , including <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> law enforcement and rape crisis centers . 
<PERSON>Gould</PERSON> said the effects of this movement against sexual assault may already be felt . 
" This very conversation was n't happening last year at this scale , " <PERSON>Gould</PERSON> said of the growing prevalence of knowledge about the dangers of sexual assault and how to approach sexual assault cases . 
" There wo n't just be one climate culture survey . 
There wo n't be just one training module . 
There 'll be many . 
Throughout the year [ the movement ] will be noticed . " 
Correction : A previous version of this article stated that the " educational modules " would be sent out in <DATE>December</DATE> instead of in <DATE>November</DATE> .
