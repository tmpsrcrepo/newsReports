<PERSON>Lauren Hornsby</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily Incumbent President <PERSON>Jalen Ross</PERSON> and newly elected President <PERSON>Abraham Axler</PERSON> Student Council met <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to address changing policies on CIOs , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> sustainability and sexual assault . 
The new initiatives include approving new CIO 's and discussing the addition of a " sustainability " tab on the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's home page . 
The meeting also included conversation on President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> 's Ad <ORGANIZATION>Hoc Working Group</ORGANIZATION> 's town hall meetings . 
Second-year College student <PERSON>Abraham Axler</PERSON> , chair of the representative body and newly-elected <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> president , opened the meeting by asking the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> members if they had ideas regarding sexual assault prevention after having attending the <DATE>Monday</DATE> town hall meeting . 
" What infrastructure can we create in order to effectively prevent sexual assault ? " 
Axler asked . 
" Looking at the nitty-gritty of the infrastructure of how resources are being used , like whether the blue lights are being used and where [ the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> ] is putting lights . " 
Many council members said that they experienced problems and have heard complaints about the security of the first-year dorms and technology used to ensure safety on <ORGANIZATION>McCormick</ORGANIZATION> and Alderman Road . " 
[ The new dorm 's doors ] are ' prison-style ' in which you have to slide your card to get into the dorm , slide your card to use the elevator and slide your card and press in a code in order to just get into the room , " said safety and wellness committee co-chair <PERSON>Rachel Murphy</PERSON> , a third-year College student . 
" Obviously this is good for safety measures however , the ability to get into your room with easy access is not , " she said . 
Members also discussed how new dorms doors are " heavy , " which ruins the atmosphere established by old dorms ' lighter and more accessible doors . 
Council members said they will discuss further the balance between ensuring student safety and accommodating the access to student dorm rooms . 
Council members also discussed approval of future CIO 's , many of which pertain to specific groups at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> such as minorities and Greek community members . 
A <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter of <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Jill of America Inc.</ORGANIZATION> is one such CIO under discussion . 
This group would provide mentors to African American children through leadership development exercises , volunteer opportunities and civic duty activities . 
Vice President of Organizations , <PERSON>Kyle West</PERSON> , a third-year <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> student , said he and other council members had apprehensions about approving the <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jill</PERSON> group due to specific requirements the national organization had for membership . 
" We are n't exactly comfortable with the requirements of the national policies that to be a member , a person 's mother has to be of African-American descent , which restricts the amount of people that can develop their leadership skills through this organization , " West said . 
" It takes the power of the individual who wants to join out their hands , due to circumstances that are out of their control with these restrictions present at the national level . " 
Other <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jill</PERSON> national policies stipulate a member must be a legacy or has be invited to the organization . 
Various council members used <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jill</PERSON> to address the broader issue of determining how a potential CIO will be affiliated with the the national organization and subsequent membership requirements . 
Council members ultimately approved of the <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jill</PERSON> collegiate chapter with a unanimous vote , along with mixed votes on various other new CIO 's . 
Council members also unanimously voted in support of the installment of a ' sustainability ' tab on the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's home webpage . 
First-year College student <PERSON>Katherine Harrison</PERSON> , a <ORGANIZATION>Sustainability Committee</ORGANIZATION> member , proposed the resolution for the tab . 
According to the resolution , one goal of the new tab is to ensure students " recognize Sustainability efforts as fundamental for the betterment of our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and our world . " 
<PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> 's resolution states the " easy access to Sustainability " will lead to such benefits for the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> as having cleaner Grounds , more beautiful gardens and waste-free events . 
The tab would also act as a selling point for prospective students as well as augment the attention on issues of sustainability , hopefully leading to more student engagement with the sustainability movement . 
The resolution faced little resistance from the council members . 
<PERSON>Axler</PERSON> said the proposition was " pretty much noncontroversial . " 
<PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> also said all of the people she has met with so far are " all for [ the tab ] . " 
With the backing of the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> , she said she plans to meet with <PERSON>Carol Keith</PERSON> , who is in charge of revamping the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's webpage , in order to finalize the implementation of the ' Sustainability ' tab .
