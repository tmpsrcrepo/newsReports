The Bible condemns homosexuality , does n't it ? 
According to most conservative Christian leaders , it does . 
Most of these political and religious figures , from <PERSON>Jerry Falwell</PERSON> to <PERSON>Gary Bauer</PERSON> agree : The Bible is clear ; homosexuality is wrong . 
By taking a strict literal interpretation of the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> , yes , it does condemn homosexuality . 
But the verses used by many on the Christian Right are taken completely outside of the proper historical context . 
Examining these verses more closely , it becomes evident that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality . 
The Bible has long been used as a tool to persecute minorities . 
Anti-abolitionists used verses in the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> to justify slavery , and opponents of the feminist movement and the civil rights movement both used biblical quotations to argue against granting equal rights to women and blacks . 
Now , Christian leaders have been using these Bible passages to justify discrimination , sodomy statutes , denial of " civil unions " and , in some extreme cases , violence and murder . 
It 's far past time that some of the Christians who condemn homosexuals take a closer look at the passages they use . 
The most commonly cited verse in the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> is <LOCATION>Leviticus 18:22</LOCATION> , which states that a man " is not to lie with a man as with a woman ; it is an abomination . " 
It seems fairly straightforward , until we look at it in its proper historical context . 
For instance , chapter 18 of <LOCATION>Leviticus</LOCATION> begins by saying that the Israelites should not do as <LOCATION>the Canaanites</LOCATION> did -- this is the main focus of the chapter . 
<PERSON>Daniel Helminiak</PERSON> , a biblical scholar and an ordained Roman Catholic priest , asserts that the laws included in this chapter were to prohibit acts used in Canaanite rituals , and included was the law against homosexuality ( " What the Bible Really Says About Homosexuality " ) . 
This was banned because doing so would be akin to identifying with the Gentiles , or to " betray the Jewish religion . " 
In other words , homosexuality was not banned because it was morally or ethically wrong , but because it was associated with pagan rituals . 
Seeing as that this context no longer applies , the law should n't apply either . 
In fact , Christians today are not bound by these laws ( Galatians 3:22 -25 ) . 
Similarly , the story of Sodom ( Genesis 19:1 -25 ) is used to point out how God will smite homosexuals . 
While the story details homosexual rape , this particular act was seen as one of violence and inhospitality , not of sexual deviancy . 
When the reasons behind the destruction of Sodom are mentioned later in the Bible ( Ezekiel 16:48 -50 ) , arrogance , inhospitality and idolatry all are listed , but nothing is said of sex . 
Likewise , in <LOCATION>Romans 1:26</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> essentially calls homosexual relations " unnatural , " which is one of the few New Testament references to homosexuality . 
However , the Greek term used as unnatural , " para physin , " is used to refer to something that is socially unacceptable , not something that is immoral in nature . 
Other uses by <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> of this word can be found to describe a father who refuses to give his daughter in marriage ( 1 Corinthians 7:36 ) and " unpresentable " parts of the body ( 1 Corinthians 12:23 ) ; in both cases , the use of this Latin phrase is to assert something that is socially taboo and not a moral condemnation . 
More comprehensive studies on the issue have been done ; for some examples , <ORGANIZATION>Helminiak</ORGANIZATION> 's " What the Bible Really Says About Homosexuality , " <PERSON>John Boswell</PERSON> 's " Christianity , Social Tolerance , and Homosexuality " and <PERSON>Walter Wink</PERSON> 's " Homosexuality and the Bible . " 
It also should be noted that throughout the New Testament , Jesus never even mentioned homosexuality . 
Some Christians assert that a strict literal interpretation is correct , because everything written in the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> is true and unchanging . 
If that 's so , then there are a lot of rules that anti-gay Christians should be aware of . 
While the book of <LOCATION>Leviticus</LOCATION> does mention homosexuality , it also prohibits harvesting the corners of fields ( 18:19 ) , wearing clothes that come from blended fabrics or planting two seeds in the same field ( 19:19 ) , shaving or getting a haircut ( 19:27 ) , and charging interest or making a profit at the expense of another ( 25:37 ) . 
But anti-gay activists are quick to attack anyone who would question their interpretation of these Bible verses . 
<PERSON>Bob Davies</PERSON> , former president of <ORGANIZATION>Exodus International</ORGANIZATION> , an ex-gay group , asserts that anyone who says that the <ORGANIZATION>Bible</ORGANIZATION> does n't condemn gays " has absolutely no idea what the Bible actually teaches , " and is guilty of " willful blindness " ( http://www.bible.ca/s-homo=sin.htm ) . 
However , <PERSON>Davies</PERSON> fails to even acknowledge on the Web site any of the arguments against the literal interpretation of the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> , much less address them . 
The lie that the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> condemns homosexuality has been repeated so many times , it has become commonly accepted as fact . 
While Christian leaders hide behind simplistic interpretations of these verses , a detailed look behind them shows the fundamental truth : that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality .
