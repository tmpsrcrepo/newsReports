Watching <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> take the podium at Convocation on <DATE>August 24</DATE> , I expected the standard welcome to our incoming first year and transfer students : a few class statistics , some reflections on the special responsibility of attending the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and encouragement to find ways to serve the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and the surrounding community . 
I was surprised , then , when she began speaking about sexual assault . 
First year women , she noted , are particularly at risk . 
She spoke at length on the topic , citing statistics ( for example , <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of reported campus sexual assaults occur in the first three months of the school year ) and introducing the new Hoos Got Your Back campaign , a bystander awareness program that joins student groups with local merchants . 
This was the first ever mention of sexual violence in a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> president 's Convocation Welcome address ( last year 's was particularly routine ) , and such a break from tradition underscores recent attention to the issue . 
From President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's national task force on sexual assault to outspoken criticism by students , the topic has received serious attention at all levels of authority . 
But this attitude was not always the case . 
Over the past two decades , sexual assault has often been ignored or even mocked . 
President <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> 's address to students <DATE>last Sunday</DATE> signifies a much more productive approach : serious attention coupled with productive , wide-ranging preventative action . 
" I thought it was a bit dramatic , " said one friend about Ms. <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> 's mention of sexual violence . 
Shortly after , another friend criticized the new policy of designating <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employees as " Confidential " or " Responsible , " with respect to student disclosures of sexual misconduct : " I 'm a little worried that this whole thing is going too far , " she said . 
I disagree with these offhanded criticisms , and they bring to mind some common attitudes toward sexual assault : namely , ignoring or ridiculing it . 
Let 's address the latter attitude first . 
<PERSON>Katie Roiphe</PERSON> , the author , journalist , and self-proclaimed feminist , is perhaps one of the most famous critics of sexual violence activism . 
Since <DATE>1993</DATE> , when the author railed against " victim feminism " and mocked " Take Back the Night " speak-outs in the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Roiphe</PERSON> has exemplified such attitudes . 
Her nuanced but flawed argument - which downplays the prevalence of campus sexual assault while also ridiculing efforts to raise awareness for the issue - can hardly be considered a productive way to help the one in four college women who have survived rape or attempted rape ( <ORGANIZATION>Roiphe</ORGANIZATION> also questions and mocks this statistic , too ) . 
But for as much criticism as <ORGANIZATION>Roiphe</ORGANIZATION> 's position receives , ignoring sexual violence altogether is the more common attitude . 
This older position - surely a product of long-standing cultural taboos toward sex - has taken a major blow with sexual assault 's recent breakthrough in the national conversation . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> 's Convocation address seems to signify the start of a very productive year . 
In my inbox , I see the president 's email about our new sexual misconduct policies ( complete with an extensive new website ) . 
On Grounds , I hear students speak openly and productively about reducing sexual violence . 
And on the <ORGANIZATION>Corner</ORGANIZATION> , I see restaurant employees wearing " Not on Our Grounds " sexual assault awareness t-shirts . 
These initial policies , while promising , are only part of the solution to college sexual violence . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> - which is currently under federal investigation for allegedly mishandling a sexual misconduct case - has a poor track record in both prevention and punitive action . 
As the subsequent phases of the extensive " Not on Our Grounds " campaign roll out , students must keep the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> accountable for meaningful policy change . 
The legal issues surrounding punishment for sexual assault make reform complicated but not impossible . 
As we begin the new academic year , it remains to be seen whether these creative solutions will reduce sexual assault among <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students . 
One point is certain : we 're better off without the ridicule or silence .
