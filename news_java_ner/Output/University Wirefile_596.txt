Kelsey Grant | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily The University</ORGANIZATION> saw a decrease in total applicants for the undergraduate Class of <DATE>2019</DATE> compared to last year , with the number of applications shrinking from 31,336 to 31,107 . 
The marginal drop did not come as a surprise to the admissions office , Dean of Admission <PERSON>Gregory Roberts</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said he anticipated a drop-off following significant growth in total applicants in recent years . 
" I 've spoken to four other admissions deans from top 25 institutions , and they 've experienced declines more significant than what we 've experienced , " <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said . 
" It is something that we almost expected nationally . " 
<PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said that with more than 31,000 applicants , the pool is just as robust as it has been in the past . 
" It 's still a deep and strong application pool , " <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said . 
Alumni and faculty have expressed concern about this year 's application pool following a <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE> Rolling Stone article detailing an alleged gang rape at a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> fraternity . 
<PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said it is too early to tell if the article will have had a significant impact . 
" It 's impossible to determine at this point whether [ the Rolling Stone article ] did or did not affect [ application volume ] , " <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said . 
" What I have n't looked at yet is the submission by gender , for example . 
That may or may not tell us anything , but its something to look at . " 
Though it is unclear whether the article will lead to a lower acceptance rate in the future , <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said three prospective students asked to have their applications withdrawn in protest of the allegations made in the article . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> also saw a spike in the number of first-generation applicants , which the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Undergraduate Admission</ORGANIZATION> credits to revamped recruiting efforts aimed at reaching underrepresented student populations . 
According to preliminary data , there were 370 more first-generation applicants than <DATE>last year</DATE> - a <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> increase . 
<PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said this increase is precisely what the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Undergraduate Admission</ORGANIZATION> was aiming for in its outreach efforts . 
" We spent considerable effort recruiting first-generation students because we want the best and most interesting students at <LOCATION>U.Va.</LOCATION> , regardless of their background , " <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said . 
Admission recruiters reached out to students who do not typically consider applying to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> for financial reasons , advertising <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> scholarships such as Blue Ridge Scholarships and financial aid options such as AccessUVa . 
" We do n't want any student to be discouraged from applying for fear of cost of attendance , " <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said . 
" We have a robust financial aid program which should be an attraction . " 
Recruiters traveled most extensively in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , reaching out to more rural populations . 
School districts in <LOCATION>central Virginia</LOCATION> - where the number of students receiving free or reduced lunches is higher than in other districts - were given greater attention than in past years . 
The admission staff also toured outside of the state , partnering with recruiters from <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION> in search of applicants from both urban and rural areas , <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said .
