The Cavalier Daily In coordination with the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Resource Agency</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Restaurant & Skybar</ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION>Downtown Mall</ORGANIZATION> organized a meeting last <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> with to train bartenders and restaurant staff in bystander intervention . 
SARA Executive Director <PERSON>Rebecca Weybright</PERSON> said about 20 bartenders attended the meeting . 
In wake of second-year College student <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> 's disappearance and death , a number of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> establishments opted to participate in training to prevent sexual misconduct , she said . 
<PERSON>Taylor Starns</PERSON> , crisis services coordinator of <ORGANIZATION>SARA</ORGANIZATION> , said the goal of the meeting was to emphasize the power restaurant and bar staff have to prevent certain instances of sexual misconduct . 
" The goal of the meeting was to empower staff at bars and restaurants to be active bystanders in perceived high-risk situations , " <PERSON>Starns</PERSON> said in an email . 
" There is more attention on the issue at the moment , especially in wake of the <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> case , but we want to emphasize that there is always a need for this sort of treatment and this sort of solution . " 
<PERSON>Starns</PERSON> said the group discussed some of the inhibitors to intervention and how some of them may be overcome . 
" We wanted to hear what their obstacles for intervention are and to provide methods of intervention that take those obstacles into account , " <PERSON>Starns</PERSON> said . 
" The goal was for them to leave feeling like they had concrete strategies for intervening and for us to have a sense of how we can continue to support local bars and restaurants around this issue . " 
This discussion was initiated by workers at the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Restaurant & Skybar</ORGANIZATION> and grew as more restaurants expressed interest . 
Weybright said increased collaboration is essential for the discussion of sexual assault to become common in the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> community . 
" These restaurants got people through the door in order to talk , " <PERSON>Weybright</PERSON> said . 
" This is vital in order for there to be dialogue and for plans to turn into action . " 
Bartenders said the security presence on the Downtown Mall should be heightened . 
Additionally , <PERSON>Starns</PERSON> said , they hope to engage with more management-level individuals at various businesses to increase bystander intervention . 
" After the training-focused portion of the meeting , we strategized on how to continue the conversation and how to approach other local systems , such as law enforcement , for support around increasing safety on the Mall , " <PERSON>Starns</PERSON> said . 
" We were hoping to help bar and restaurant staff feel more empowered to intervene in situations and to hear from them what we can do as an agency to support them around these issues . " 
Continued conversation within the community of restaurants and bars was deemed essential to furthering action against sexual assault . 
" The sense of the meeting yesterday was that we would like to continue to strategize with restaurants and bars to train staff in bystander intervention and to encourage management to create policies that make it clear that they want their spaces to be violence free , and that they 'll support their staff in intervening in situations that seem high-risk , " <PERSON>Starns</PERSON> said . 
Weybright said they are looking to extend the conversation further to restaurants on the Corner . 
" It 's a great area to reach , but <ORGANIZATION>SARA</ORGANIZATION> is going to leave any additional meetings up to the restaurants who generated the momentum and any other businesses they attract , " <PERSON>Weybright</PERSON> said .
