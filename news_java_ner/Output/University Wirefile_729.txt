Students and faculty faced a number of traumatic events this academic year , repeatedly putting the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> at the forefront of national news . 
Shortly after school started , the community faced the disappearance of <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> . 
A couple months later , Rolling Stone magazine published a graphic story , titled " A Rape on Campus , " which detailed an alleged case of sexual assault on Grounds and called the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's culture into question . 
By the close of the fall semester , the community had been shaken by four student deaths . 
After a fresh start in the <DATE>spring</DATE> , <PERSON>Martese Johnson</PERSON> received a head injury while being arrested by <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> officers on the Corner , sparking student protests and more national attention . 
While students and faculty experienced the same events , the degree to which they were emotionally and intellectually engaged varied . 
Some students continued to fulfill their responsibilities , while others found daily tasks challenging . 
Both parents and students expressed concerns about safety , and individuals inside and outside the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> questioned the administration . 
However , the year 's obstacles also offered new opportunities for dialogue in the classroom and new ways for students to support one another . 
Impact on everyday life Some University students , other than being present on Grounds , were not directly impacted by this year 's events . 
First-year College student <PERSON>Ady Sethi</PERSON> said the events did not interfere with his ability to complete school work . 
However , for student leaders and friends of <PERSON>Martese Johnson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> , such as fourth-year College student <PERSON>Joy Omenyi</PERSON> , the outgoing President of <ORGANIZATION>Black Student Alliance</ORGANIZATION> , and third-year College student <PERSON>Hallie Pence</PERSON> , the Vice President of Skiing of the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Alpine Ski and <ORGANIZATION>Snowboard Team</ORGANIZATION> , it was difficult to fulfill daily responsibilities in the midst of trauma . 
" It 's a lot to have to consume , " <PERSON>Omenyi</PERSON> said . 
" You fear every time your email pings whether it 's a new incident . 
Every time you get an email from President <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> , you do n't know what the next ordeal is . " 
Omenyi said she did not sleep after <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was arrested , and she struggled to escape thoughts of what was happening outside the classroom . 
" I think [ the arrest ] affected everyone 's school work in the sense that you ca n't forget what 's going on or what you read <TIME>this morning</TIME> , " <PERSON>Omenyi</PERSON> said . 
" You ca n't forget all the texts you got in class . 
You ca n't forget any of that while trying to find the derivative of an equation - that is still in the back of your mind . " 
In the midst of these distractions , work and responsibilities did not disappear . 
While professors checked in with students who were deeply affected , students continued to move forward . 
" I think my friend group , in particular , learned the value of resiliency , " Pence said . 
" We had to keep going every day , regardless of whether it was a good day or a bad day . " 
Some students who were not as closely attached to the incidents were also deeply affected . 
Second-year College student <PERSON>Mary Collin</PERSON> said her grades suffered this semester as a result of the year 's challenges . 
" Largely , I tried to block it out and I did a really good job of that through first semester in trying not to let it affect schoolwork and my relationship with friends and how I go out and be social , " <PERSON>Collin</PERSON> said . 
" Then , second semester when I got back , it all caught up with me when I was out and saw something ugly and after that , honestly , it was really tough - even though nothing particularly bad was happening . " 
Concerns about safety As the year progressed , many parents expressed fear about the safety of their children . 
" I think it was traumatizing - not just as a student , but as a female student - because your mom is calling you everyday like ' Do n't go outside ! ' " 
Omenyi said . 
" We [ did n't ] know where [ was ] safe for us . 
Can we stay at home ? 
Can we go to the Corner ? 
Can we go downtown ? 
We had absolutely no idea . " 
Although some students did not feel like their personal safety was threatened , they felt an increased responsibility for the safety of their peers . 
" I do n't feel in danger in anyway , but I feel like I understand how it might affect others ... and because of that , I feel like I should be there to support them , " <PERSON>Sethi</PERSON> said . 
Students also learned the importance of looking out for one another . " 
[ I think we learned to ] look out for each other more , " first-year Engineering student <PERSON>Stephen Pancrazio</PERSON> said . 
" If somebody [ has ] to be walked home , you ca n't let them take care of themselves - you 've got to actually be there for them , you 've got to make sure they get home safe . " 
Perceptions of administration and the <ORGANIZATION>University As the University</ORGANIZATION> administration took action to address different issues , some students , like fourth-year Engineering student and fraternity member <PERSON>Daniel Harelson</PERSON> , expressed dissatisfaction . 
" I was upset that the administration decided to react so quickly to point fingers at fraternities [ after Rolling Stone ] , " <PERSON>Harelson</PERSON> said . 
" I think there is a problem - I do n't think it 's unique to U.Va , I do n't think it 's unique to fraternities . 
The fact that sororities and fraternities were shut down so quickly just kind of pigeonholed the investigation and the blame in people 's eyes . 
The Rolling Stone article affected the school practically in that the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> had to institute all these different changes when they redid their [ Fraternal Organization Agreements ] . 
Those are actual , physical differences that we see at our parties . " 
For Pence , though , the administration provided support throughout the <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> investigation and in its wake . 
" Administration was just really phenomenal , " Pence said . 
" We 're really thankful for the deans [ who ] were there for us and continue to be there for us . " 
While students were confronted with outsiders ' negative reactions to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's events , some , like <PERSON>Collin</PERSON> , continued to feel unwavering loyalty . 
<PERSON>Collin</PERSON> said her positive experiences last year contrast starkly with this year 's challenges , but her admiration for <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> remains . 
" I do n't see [ the school ] any differently , " <PERSON>Collin</PERSON> said . 
" I still love it just as much . " 
New opportunity for dialogue Both inside and outside the classroom , students were given the opportunity to discuss issues they might not have discussed otherwise . 
" These types of serious events provide people [ with ] an opportunity to express how they feel more seriously , " <PERSON>Pancrazio</PERSON> said . " 
[ As opposed to ] just joking around starting to know your friends ... you can actually get to know somebody on a deeper level . " 
Whether or not events happening outside of the classroom were addressed in an academic setting varied by the professor and the course topic . 
For professors , such as Women Gender Studies Prof. <PERSON>Corrine Field</PERSON> , the classroom was a forum for discussion . 
" As a historian , I see the ways in which issues today , playing out on campus , are deeply structured by the history that we study in my class ... so giving students a forum where they can connect that history to the struggles they are facing today , I think , has been very productive and it 's helped people see why this history still matters , " Field said . 
Other professors chose not to discuss what was happening outside the classroom , and some decided to take a middle ground . 
" We never had [ a ] discussion [ on these events ] , but normally [ professors took ] a moment to talk about it and reassure us they were here for us , " <PERSON>Collin</PERSON> said . 
Some discussions allowed students the opportunity to understand different perspectives , Field said . " 
[ I noticed ] a very mature , thoughtful ability [ of students ] to talk to each other about quite difficult topics and really wrestle with ways that students disagree and understand their experiences here differently , but , at least in my classes , were willing to hear each other out and learn from each other , " Field said . 
" And I learned a lot from them as well . " 
Finding strength in camaraderie Students faced with the challenges and traumas this year has presented found new ways to act as support networks for those who were deeply impacted . 
" We could really feel how much the community cared and was affected by everything , " Pence said . 
" They were confused and upset by everything that happened . 
It felt like the community at large was going through it with us . 
People were really wonderful about reaching out and sending care packages over to the house for us . 
Secret societies would leave notes and have dinners for us . " 
Although students differed in their experiences of the past year , <PERSON>Omenyi</PERSON> said the community came together in a way she had never seen before . 
" I think one thing that kept me going and one thing that kept a lot of students going was that camaraderie you found in other students , that ability to be able to reach out to your fellow student because we were all going through it at the same time , maybe different levels of it , but I think that 's something that at least kept me going , especially with Martese , " <PERSON>Omenyi</PERSON> said . 
" Just the way that the community came together in ways that I have never seen in my four years . " 
American Studies Prof. <PERSON>Lisa Goff</PERSON> said this year has been a pivotal one for <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> as a whole . 
" When a crisis happens - or two or three - we see difficult truths that have been there all along : murder , sexual violence , police brutality , " <PERSON>Goff</PERSON> said in an email . 
" We either look away or face it . 
I think this year might have been a turning point for U.Va. , from looking away to facing crises . "
