Strolling down the Lawn on a beautiful <DATE>fall</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> , it was hard not to think it . 
My parents and I were chatting about the Convocation ceremony and some of the finer points of <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> 's philosophy on education . 
My mom sighed . 
" You know , " she said , " <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> is the perfect man . " 
It was almost too ironic that the news broke <DATE>less than 24 hours later</DATE> . 
On <DATE>Nov. 1</DATE> , retired <ORGANIZATION>University Pathology</ORGANIZATION> Prof. <PERSON>Eugene A. Foster</PERSON> held a press conference at <LOCATION>Monticello</LOCATION> , where he revealed DNA evidence indicating a strong possibility that <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> was the father of the fourth child of <PERSON>Sally Hemings</PERSON> , a mulatto slave at <LOCATION>Monticello</LOCATION> . 
Foster 's tests compared the DNA of male-line descendants of <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> 's paternal uncle to DNA from male-line descendants of two of Hemings children , and discovered there is a 100 to one chance that <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> fathered <PERSON>Eston Hemings</PERSON> . 
The news seemed to shock the community outside <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> more than the area within , given the fact that rumors about a Jefferson-Hemings affair have circulated around <LOCATION>Monticello</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> for years , and many have already accepted it as fact . 
But this scientific evidence all but proves the speculation true , and an important question arises : How should we , as students at <ORGANIZATION>Jefferson 's University</ORGANIZATION> , react to the news that our founder may have fathered a slave 's child ? 
Should we feel disillusioned and devastated that a hero has fallen ? 
Should we vehemently deny the claims and defend our founder ? 
Or should we resort to our usual state of apathy , and ignore the matter all together ? 
None of the above . 
Instead , every member of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community should seize the opportunity to reexamine our understanding of <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> -- not only as a founder of our country and our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , but also as a man . 
Our examination is hindered by the fact that we know nothing beyond the pure scientific facts of a Jefferson-Hemings relationship . 
We do n't know whether it was a case of master/slave rape or a love story that transcended racial and social boundaries . 
Most likely , we never will know for sure -- though the fact that <PERSON>Hemings</PERSON> chose not to take advantage of the opportunity to leave <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> while serving as his daughter 's maid in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> points to a more consensual relationship . 
But even that point begs the all-too-familiar question : How can a relationship so unbalanced in terms of power possibly be consensual ? 
Clearly , the knowledge that <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> had a sexual relationship with <ORGANIZATION>Hemings</ORGANIZATION> raises significant moral questions . 
But does that topple him from the white marble pedestal he sits on at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> ? 
And should it ? 
As many historians have been quick to point out , the relationship is not the first indication of contradiction between <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> 's beliefs and his actions . 
He preached against the institution of slavery , but owned slaves himself . 
He wrote documents that demanded equality of all men , as well as articles that revealed his own racial prejudice . 
But these contradictions and the knowledge of his relationship with <PERSON>Hemings</PERSON> should not undermine the way in which we view our founder . 
They do not change the fact that he was one of the most advanced political thinkers of his time ; that he was so powerful a writer that his words still affect the life we experience at his <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> every day . 
At the same time , though , instead of dismissing his personal actions as inconsequential , these complexities in character should inspire us to delve even deeper into the philosophies that we often so easily accept as gospel . 
This Thanksgiving , rather than blithely quoting <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> over dinner , we should engage our families and friends in a debate about what we have learned about <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> and how to reconcile it with his famous words and principles . 
Jefferson 's <LOCATION>Academical Village</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's intellectual community will thrive on the examination of these complexities , rather than the passive dismissal of any assaults on his character . 
But this new insight into <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> also leaves us with one more important lesson . 
Immersed in an atmosphere that bears his mark in so many ways , we often find it hard to believe our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's founder was not perfect . 
In fact , he was a man and he had flaws . 
But he also had dreams and big ideas . 
No matter what his personal imperfections , <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> left a legacy of truth and honor that never ceases to inspire us . 
And if we take nothing else from that knowledge , we should realize that no matter what our own mistakes , we possess that same potential .
