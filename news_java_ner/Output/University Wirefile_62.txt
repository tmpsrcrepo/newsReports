About 100 students , staff and faculty presented University Rector <PERSON>John P. Ackerly III</PERSON> with a proposal calling for the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> to support a living wage for <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employees at the steps of the <LOCATION>Rotunda</LOCATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Labor Action Group</ORGANIZATION> , which organized the event , proposed that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> raise the minimum wage for <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employees to " a base pay of no less than <MONEY>$ 8</MONEY> per hour with annual adjustments for no less than <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> of the federal poverty level for a family of four . " 
The current daytime minimum wage for <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employees is <MONEY>$ 6.13</MONEY> an hour . 
Such a wage increase would affect the classified employees , who are employed by the state . 
<PERSON>Ackerly</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> is not in a position to help raise the minimum wage . 
" I view this matter primarily one for the administration and the Commonwealth of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , " he said . 
" But I will be glad to take this petition back to the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> . " 
<PERSON>Leonard W. Sandridge</PERSON> , executive vice president and chief financial officer , agreed with <PERSON>Ackerly</PERSON> and said he does not know how the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> could respond to the concerns . 
" Clearly it 's a state issue -- it is difficult to see how the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> can handle it , " <PERSON>Sandridge</PERSON> said . 
Despite <PERSON>Ackerly</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sandridge</PERSON> 's statements , participants in the picket said the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> can influence the state . 
" They are the governing body of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> -- they can make things happen because the living wage issue is not going away , " LAG member and third-year Law student <PERSON>Jody Calemine</PERSON> said . 
" One-third of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's employees may be eligible for food stamps . 
Jefferson 's <LOCATION>Academical Village</LOCATION> has become an academical sweatshop , " he said . 
Along with the proposed resolution , <PERSON>Calemine</PERSON> also submitted a petition with signatures of over 1,000 students , faculty and staff members in support of a living wage to <PERSON>Ackerly</PERSON> . 
" No one working full time should live in poverty , " <PERSON>Calemine</PERSON> said . 
The LAG proposal asks the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> to state their support for a living wage , and to allow <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employees to " assemble freely over the issues of working conditions at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , without fear of reprisal . " 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Dan Warner</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> lobbied in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> for the creation of a satellite campus in <LOCATION>Qatar</LOCATION> , but " does not care enough to lobby for people to live . " 
Sexual Assault Education Coordinator <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> suggested the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> re-examine the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's budget to find a way to pay employees a living wage . 
" There are always ways of finding money when it is important -- as an institution of higher education that is pretty well funded , we have a moral obligation to ensure that no employee is forced to live under the poverty line , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said .
