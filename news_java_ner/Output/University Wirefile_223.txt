The Planned Parenthood " EC van " made its first visit to the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , offering the Plan B emergency contraception pill for sale to university students , faculty and community members . 
Members of the student group Voices for Planned Parenthood , or <ORGANIZATION>VOX</ORGANIZATION> , invited Planned Parenthood of <LOCATION>Southeastern Virginia</LOCATION> to come to the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> van was parked in front of the <ORGANIZATION>Chemistry</ORGANIZATION> building <DATE>Thursday</DATE> from <TIME>11 a.m.</TIME> to <TIME>2 p.m</TIME> . 
About a dozen prescriptions for Plan B were written for clients <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , said <PERSON>Nancy Sinibaldi</PERSON> , a nurse practitioner with Planned Parenthood . 
<PERSON>Sinibaldi</PERSON> said she spoke with patients to inform them about how and when to take emergency contraception . 
After each consultation , <PERSON>Sinibaldi</PERSON> said she wrote a prescription for Plan <PERSON>B. Sinibaldi</PERSON> said the medicine will be mailed to the client by a pharmacist in about one week . 
<PERSON>Laurie Dawson</PERSON> , the director of advocacy for <ORGANIZATION>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Virginia</ORGANIZATION> , said emergency contraception is good to have on hand to " back up your birth control " and is most effective when taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse . 
VOX President <PERSON>Lindsay Prevette</PERSON> said having emergency contraception is a good safety measure considering the high incidence of rape . 
" It needs to be in every woman 's medicine cabinet , if only for rape purposes , " <PERSON>Prevette</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> said that at least two students who were not sexually active purchased <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> as a cautionary practice . 
Members of <ORGANIZATION>VOX</ORGANIZATION> also said they wanted the <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> van to come to the university because of a bill proposed by <ORGANIZATION>State Del</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Bob Marshall</PERSON> , R-Prince <PERSON>William</PERSON> , intending to ban <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's public universities from dispensing emergency contraception . 
" We are in great danger each year of having that bill passed , " <ORGANIZATION>VOX</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Katherine Koen</PERSON> said . 
" The van is here in part to protect women if the bill goes through next year . " 
Some students also stopped by the van to state their objections to <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Lawson</PERSON> said . 
Prevette , however , said they experienced very little antagonism and <ORGANIZATION>VOX</ORGANIZATION> will most likely invite the van again next year . 
<PERSON>Samantha Kepler</PERSON> , president of the university 's pro-life group <ORGANIZATION>First Right</ORGANIZATION> , said she opposes the sale of Plan B because using the pill could be considered an abortive practice . 
" I 'm kind of concerned because a lot of women do n't realize that <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> can abort your child after conception because it can prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg , " <PERSON>Kepler</PERSON> said . 
" A lot of women do n't realize that and are n't told that that can happen . " 
<PERSON>Sinibaldi</PERSON> disagreed with <PERSON>Kepler</PERSON> and said that emergency contraception is not an abortive practice . 
" It prevents an abortion because the egg has n't even implanted , " <PERSON>Sinibaldi</PERSON> said . 
" It has to implant to be an abortion . " 
<PERSON>James Turner</PERSON> , executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Student Health</ORGANIZATION> , said <ORGANIZATION>Student Health</ORGANIZATION> makes emergency contraception available to women who need it . 
" It 's a service that is available 24 hours a day , seven days a week , to our patients , " <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said . 
" If they meet the appropriate screening criteria , they can be given emergency contraception . " 
In some cases , women who use barrier contraception and are concerned that it may fail , or who intend to travel abroad , can request a prescription for emergency contraception and have it filled in advance , <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said . 
" As long as this is a medical practice that is legal and FDA-approved , it is our intent to make it available to women just as any other medical practice , " <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said .
