It would n't be a typical crisis at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> without a disappointing response from the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> . 
At their meeting last <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> reactions ranged from welcome but vague , such as the new " zero tolerance " resolution , to misguided , such as <PERSON>Stephen Long</PERSON> 's immediate instinct to invoke straw men who " randomly point fingers and call for heads to roll . " 
After this past meeting , there 's a danger that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is headed towards milquetoast reforms that do little to the change core dynamics of the sexual assault situation . 
There 's no reason we should have to accept this . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community should take a hard look at the root causes of sexual violence rather than papering over them with half-measures that will fade away as surely as the underlying problems will not . 
One notable fixture of the meeting was <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> members pointing to alcohol as a major contributor to rape ; <PERSON>L.D. Britt</PERSON> remarked " excessive drinking is the fuel " of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's cultural problems . 
On one hand , it is n't a huge leap to acknowledge alcohol probably makes it easier for rapists to manipulate and control potential victims . 
The <ORGANIZATION>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse</ORGANIZATION> and Alcoholism notes 97,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 are victims of sexual assaults involving alcohol . 
That said , a <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> study this year observed that binge drinking among college students has declined <PERCENT>18 percent</PERCENT> since <DATE>1991</DATE> , while college students who report getting drunk in the <DATE>past month</DATE> has declined <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> over the same period . 
This data belies the notion that sexual assault on college campuses is now a major problem because of some new , out of control epidemic of underage drinking . 
It does n't make sense to blame alcohol for a much wider problem of misogyny and gender violence . 
American rates of alcohol consumption are also the lowest among the developed world , while rates of rape in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> are fourth highest among advanced countries of <ORGANIZATION>the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development</ORGANIZATION> . 
Alcohol may facilitate sexual assault , but it does not magically convince people that violating another person is a good idea ; that issue is much more deeply rooted . 
What is far more important than whether people drink alcohol is the context in which it is consumed . 
At a bar , trained bartenders make judgments about whom to serve , and proprietors can be held liable for incidents on and near their property . 
Laughable fake ID regime aside , because they have liquor licenses , professional security and regulatory oversight , bars offer a fairly safe environment for alcohol consumption . 
In contrast to private parties in which the onus is on a scared person to leave , someone drinking at a bar is usually safe staying where they are . 
Similarly , in dorms there are almost always trained RAs or non-intoxicated peers available to assist a potential victim . 
This not to say rapes do n't happen in dorms , rather that there is a built-in infrastructure to prevent assaults from occurring . 
Off-Grounds apartments are also major sites of alcohol consumption . 
There is certainly higher risk of sexual assault at apartments than at bars or dorms , but most apartments are fairly small settings where roommates or other guests can notice and then intervene in the case of potential sexual assault . 
Predators can exploit their surroundings somehow , but given the scale of most off-Grounds housing ( and that most apartment parties are run with restrictive lists ) , significant informal safeguards against rape are in place . 
This leaves us with the drinking environment that has gotten the most discussion in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and national media : fraternities . 
Most of the conversation has revolved around what kind of person is a member of a fraternity , but I think most of that discussion is unproductive and polarizing . 
What is productive is to examine institutional structures . 
The overwhelming majority of fraternity men are not rapists nor would they ever consider committing or condoning sexual violence , but as President <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said on <DATE>Monday</DATE> , " There is great concern that a sexual predator can hide out in a fraternity , and therefore that fraternal social activities pose literal dangers to their guests . " 
This has nothing to do with whether fraternities contain a vast majority of good people ( I have no doubt they do ) . 
It has everything to do with the fact that fraternities have houses with unwatched upstairs and padlocked doors , the ability to widely distribute unidentifiable mixed drinks to unknowing first-year girls and national organizations with comprehensive systems for deflecting liability . 
A rapist on a college campus is three times more likely to participate in a fraternity than not and sorority women are <PERCENT>74 percent</PERCENT> more likely to be sexually assaulted than nonaffiliated women . 
Again , whether most people in fraternities are well-meaning individuals is beside the point ; the faceless institutions in which these good people exist are flawed . 
When I first read the Rolling Stone article , my immediate reaction - after pain at hearing <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's story - was a feeling of loss about a policy solution to sexual assault . 
I have no personal conviction against the Greek system nor desire to punish the people in it . 
I also could not agree more that rape occurs in many contexts outside of the Greek system and that even if fraternities were abolished altogether , sexual assault at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> would continue . 
That said , the more I read about sexual violence in preparation for writing this article , the more it became clear to me that our community ca n't honestly address the problem if we focus only on the administration , alcohol use or hard to measure cultural and personal change . 
It is crucial that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> uses the Greek life suspension period to come up with reform that will address basic structural deficiencies through rewriting its <ORGANIZATION>Fraternal Organization Agreements</ORGANIZATION> . 
This might take the form of a new monitoring and/or oversight system independent of the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> to more carefully regulate these organizations and ensure whatever policy changes that emerge stick . 
Putting cops into fraternity houses is n't the answer , but dispassionate oversight led by students , both at parties and in a more permanent regulatory sense , can make the Greek system function more effectively for the entire <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
Being outraged about the horror of rape is easy . 
For most people , it 's a basic part of being human . 
It behooves an academic institution like ours to do what is hard .
