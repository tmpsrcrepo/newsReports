If you are looking for a feel-good movie full of bunnies and daffodils , look elsewhere by all means . 
" The Pledge , " <PERSON>Sean Penn</PERSON> 's third directorial effort , focuses on the obsession , loneliness and downfall of Det. <PERSON>Jerry Black</PERSON> ( <PERSON>Jack Nicholson</PERSON> , at his best ) . 
Although it may appear to be a standard detective mystery on the surface , Black 's case merely supplements the film 's character study of Black . 
" Pledge " begins rather conventionally with the discovery of a rape and murder of a little girl in rural <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> . 
Black , on the brink of retirement , investigates the crime scene . 
A mentally challenged <ORGANIZATION>Native American ( Benicio Del Toro</ORGANIZATION> ) , witnessed leaving the crime scene , is quickly arrested . 
The suspect commits suicide shortly after being manipulated into a confession by one detective . 
Case closed , right ? 
Not in <ORGANIZATION>Black</ORGANIZATION> 's opinion . 
He starts investigating and learns of the girl 's supposed relationship with a " giant " she called " The Wizard . " 
Despite uncovering a pattern of identical crimes , Black is forced to retire . 
He buys a dilapidated gas station near the next potential crime scene and strikes up a relationship with a single mother ( <PERSON>Robin Wright Penn</PERSON> ) who has a young girl who matches the murdered girls ' characteristics . 
Adapted from <PERSON>Friedrich Durrenmatt</PERSON> 's novel , <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> proves that conventionality is not his cup of tea . 
The grim character portrayal and leisurely pace the film takes in its second half are unexpected and differ markedly from the majority of detective thrillers . 
Black 's hobby - fishing - matches this pace nicely . 
The few red herrings that writers <PERSON>Jerry Kromolowski</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary Olson-Kromolowski</PERSON> place throughout reel in the audience , which becomes uncomfortable with the sights of the grisly murders and grows anxious to find out who is responsible . 
Unlike most detective stories , " Pledge " does not try to create an elaborate plot full of witty banter . 
Instead , it realistically depicts a hero who pursues justice so far that it takes over his own life . 
If there is anything to be learned here , it is to accept a life of moderation , because excess inevitably leads to obsession and can not only torture but also destroy one 's soul . 
" Pledge " says almost nothing explicitly about Black 's past . 
The writers only hint about his life , but there are clues sprinkled throughout as to why he made the pledge to find the killer . 
Penn spends most of the movie allowing us a glimpse into Black 's head . 
For example , there is a cleverly shot sequence at his retirement party where everybody is in focus except for Black , suggesting a deep sense of isolation . 
Nicholson once again proves he is still one of the greatest actors in the game . 
Unlike past unforgettable performances that highlight his ability to act eccentrically without going over the top , his acting here is all about subtlety . 
The mere shifting of his brow elucidates much of the man 's intricacies . 
Black 's descent into madness is executed exceptionally as he struggles to retain his grip on reality . 
Strong supporting performances by <ORGANIZATION>Del Toro</ORGANIZATION> and especially by <PERSON>Wright Penn</PERSON> raise the movie 's bar of credibility . 
Penn 's slow , occasionally discomfiting narrative may turn off some viewers , who might walk away feeling that the film is uneventful and unsatisfying . 
However , one must realize the crime investigation and its resolution are secondary to the scrutiny of <ORGANIZATION>Black</ORGANIZATION> 's psyche . 
Penn gives an example here of man 's tendency toward self-destruction and tells us that only restraint will keep humanity from teetering off the edge .
