<ORGANIZATION>Virginia House Speaker S. Vance Wilkins Jr.</ORGANIZATION> is unfit to serve as speaker . 
He should step down . 
When <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> uncovered allegations that <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> had settled a <MONEY>$ 100,000</MONEY> sexual harassment suit with <PERSON>Jennifer L. Thompson</PERSON> , 26 , who was a clerical worker at <ORGANIZATION>Wilkins Construction Co.</ORGANIZATION> , formerly owned by <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> ' father , <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> reacted . 
House Republicans and Democrats want answers . 
Wilkins wo n't budge . 
In a statement released to <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> denies having done anything wrong and cites as reasons for reaching settlement protracted legal costs and the embarrassment and unease his family would experience if it entered the public domain . 
He writes " those are very personal reasons why they avoid these suits . " 
The use of third person refers to a hypothetical person settling a legal matter out of court even though he 's innocent . 
<PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> 's implication that this is a personal matter reminds everyone of the apparent resemblance between inquiries into <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> 's sex life . 
Unfortunately for <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> ' plight , the connection between his case and the witch hunt against <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> is flimsy . 
Probing into <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> 's affair with <PERSON>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON> was an expedition into a personal and consensual relationship . 
If the allegations against <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> turn out to be true , a public official will have acted illegally by sexually harassing a co-worker . 
Which is why a public inquiry is called for . 
It 's also why <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> ' point that this issue is a personal matter over which questions must be answered is a sloppy conclusion indeed . 
Mr. <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> : You are not <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> . 
There 's no agenda to get you . 
House Republicans are calling for the inquiry , let 's not forget that . 
If <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> attempted to force himself on someone , that is not a private act . 
Illegal acts are not private just because they occur in private . 
The acts <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> is accused of are not self-regarding . 
They have a victim . 
Even if an inquiry would expose <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> ' family to embarrassment and possible loss of political sway , that is no argument against a probe . 
Anyone accused of a crime -- innocent or guilty - will endure the uncomfortable . 
But it seems more important to punish potential aggressors against women than to be concerned with how delicate their feelings about the process of doing so are . 
<PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> is the Speaker of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> . 
Public officials put themselves in the public eye . 
What they do in office -- good or bad -- falls under the media 's scrutiny . 
Similarly , what leaders do to demonstrate a lack of character bears just as much attention . 
Wilkins may very well be innocent . 
But that 's not the point . 
He 's a public official facing serious accusations . 
Private citizens and public officials alike must answer to authorities when accused of sexual harassment . 
Failure to do so states a disregard for <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> residents who have every right to expect responsible leadership . 
Wilkins states in the same excerpt from The Post that " I was not about to let any personal situation endanger the elective prospects of my caucus . " 
Too late for that . 
This is not just a personal situation . 
If it 's true , it 's a breach of public trust . 
If <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> sincerely wished not to endanger the elective prospects of his caucus , he should step down . 
Making way for a fresh , respected , untarnished leader might restore the very prospects his continued presence and silence destroys .
