Evidence from the indecent exposure incident led to <ORGANIZATION>Malnowski</ORGANIZATION> 's arrest . 
A t-shirt containing critical DNA evidence matched him to the three rape cases that lacked a suspect . 
" Based on that recovery and identification , we received a warrant for indecent exposure , " <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Michael Sheffield</PERSON> said . 
Police then learned <PERSON>Malnowski</PERSON> had left the state , said <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON>J.W.</PERSON> " Buddy " Rittenhouse . 
But <PERSON>Malnowski</PERSON> was apprehended <DATE>Aug. 28</DATE> in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> on charges of grand larceny and possession of cocaine . 
Richmond police searched for outstanding warrants and contacted authorities in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> . 
Malnowski was transported to <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> . 
Alhough Malnowski is being held in custody , police said they plan to investigate whether he may be linked to other unsolved rape and assault cases . 
During the <DATE>summer of 1997</DATE> , there were several sexual assaults on local and <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> women that prompted concern for the safety of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> residents . 
" When you can solve cases that are two or three years old , it gives you a real lift , " said <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Captain <PERSON>Michael Coleman</PERSON> . 
But <PERSON>Sheffield</PERSON> was quick to point out that students still need to take precautions when it comes to safety . 
" We 'd like to remind faculty and students that we still have unresolved cases and this man is not responsible , " for all of them , he said . 
Students always should know their surroundings , use the buddy system and avoid taking the same route every day , <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said . 
Police attribute the arrest to the cooperation between departments . 
" We are very fortunate that we have such a close working relationship , " <PERSON>Sheffield</PERSON> said . 
" We do n't separate the crime with the brick walls at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The same people that commit crimes in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> commit them on Grounds , " he said .
