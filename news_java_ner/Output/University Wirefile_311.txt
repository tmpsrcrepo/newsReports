ON AN imaginary scale of enormity , the pederasty of ex-Rep . 
<PERSON>Mark Foley</PERSON> , <LOCATION>R-Fla.</LOCATION> , ranks slightly below any conspiracy to conceal it , and even further below the manipulation of the scandal to appropriate American homophobia as a " wedge issue " in the upcoming mid-term election . 
Moments after the public learned thatFoley exchanged lewd instant messages with adolescent congressional pages , lawmakers promptly proclaimed the following : <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> 's behavior was " unacceptable and abhorrent , " we did n't know about it , and now that we do know about it , he must be punished for his sinister ways . 
The first claim appears legitimate , albeit surreptitious , as you 'll soon learn . 
Foley 's behavior -- cyber-molesting underage boys -- excites the sort of disgust normally reserved for celebrity creep <PERSON>John Mark Karr</PERSON> and child-raping Catholic priests . 
But the second and third claims , I think , deserve a bit more attention . 
To avoid having their majority threatened by one perverted colleague or to halt their plummeting poll numbers , Republican lawmakers ignored <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> 's inappropriateness hoping , one assumes , that <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> would reform - at least before the midterm elections . 
In early <DATE>October</DATE> , however , The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> reported that " top House Republicans knew for months about e-mail traffic ... but kept the matter secret and allowed Mr. <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> to remain head of a Congressional caucus on children 's issues . " 
So , as it appears here , the scandal has essentially two main dimensions : <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> 's perverse ( and potentially felonious ) behavior and Congressional leadership 's dishonest ( and potentially felonious ) cover-up . 
It 's tempting , I admit , to leave it at that -- to let inept Republican leadership self-immolate just months before their terms expire in <DATE>January</DATE> . 
Despite the seemingly toxic climate for the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> , it would be shortsighted to ignore precisely how both Republicans and Democrats manipulated the scandal to their advantage . 
The Democrats ' windfall is so obvious it barely deserves mentioning . 
Perversion , or the appearance of perversion , sells papers . 
And <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> 's erotic predilections draw unwanted attention to a party inundated with failed , failing or unpopular policies . 
Democrats in the past seemed pathetically inept in converting Republican blunders into political capital , but given the present circumstances , the scandals seem to speak for themselves . 
Most readers , I think , would have trouble identifying among the <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> scandal the potential benefits for Republicans . 
I did , too , until I remembered a key component of <ORGANIZATION>Karl Rove</ORGANIZATION> 's electoral strategy during President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's <DATE>2004</DATE> reelection campaign . 
Rove , in conjunction with Republican members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> , ensured that " gay marriage " found a place on every ballot where evangelical Christians might read it . 
The right thus confirmed " gay marriage " as the wedge issue du jour , with which they motivated thousands of evangelical voters , who exercised their homophobia -- in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> , specifically -- to guarantee <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> a second term . 
It will be interesting to see whether or not similar groups annex the <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> scandal to portray homosexuals as seething <PERSON>Humbert Humberts</PERSON> , eagerlypreying upon rose-cheeked youth ; ( Gays ca n't restrain their pedophilic tendencies , so they should n't marry , much less adopt children ) . 
It seems implausible , I know , but watch carefully and see if <PERSON>Pat Robertson</PERSON> or <PERSON>Jerry Falwell</PERSON> or <PERSON>Rick Santorum</PERSON> does n't cite <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> as an example of typical homosexual deviance . 
One must also consider the possibility that the <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> scandal has renewed the possibility of using strategy again , but by Democrats . 
<PERSON>John Dickerson</PERSON> wrote recently in Slate how Democrats could easily " use homophobia in a way usually associated with the Republican Party . " 
<PERSON>Dickerson</PERSON> observed that , in order for the Foley scandal to elicit the type of outrage they need , Democrats might have to appeal to those for whom homosexuality is unconditionally evil . 
The issue here -- and it 's depressing I feel the need to point this out -- is of improper conduct between a man and an underage boy -- between a congressman and his subordinate . 
Foley 's homosexuality is , in itself , superfluous . 
Unfortunately , however his behavior mirrors perfectly the version of homosexuality deployed by Christian fanatics like <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> and the Falwell/Robertson " you helped [ 9/11 ] happen " cadre . 
As it happens , one need n't look farther than <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's upcoming election to observe how similar forms of homophobia divide the electorate . 
The upcoming referendum concerning the Marshall-Newman Amendment poses a question to voters that , even as I write it , reeks of thinly-veiled bigotry : Should <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> constitutionalize discrimination against homosexuals ? 
As we consider this issue and , indeed , the <PERSON>Foley</PERSON> scandal , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> voters ought to bear in mind the ease with which stereotypes and misconceptions poison well-reasoned debate . 
Likewise , Democrats must resist the temptation to indulge in homophobia and blatant bigotry for an easy , convenient victory . 
<PERSON>Mark Foley</PERSON> 's behavior was sinister . 
But sin loves company , and it would be a shame for Democrats to oblige .
