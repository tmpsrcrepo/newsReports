In the latest of a string of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> , burglaries , an unidentified intruder assaulted a woman in her apartment on the <DATE>1500</DATE> block of Broad Avenue <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> at approximately <TIME>9:30 p.m.</TIME> , according to the <LOCATION>Charlottesville Police</LOCATION> . 
The woman , a white female in her 50s , unlocked her front door , set a bag down inside and walked to her mailbox . 
Upon reentering , she encountered a man coming from her room and screamed as the man told her to be quiet . 
She was knocked to the floor , and her head was lacerated , according to press release said . 
The neighbors living above her reportedly heard her screams , dialed 911 and stomped on the floor , frightening the intruder away , <ORGANIZATION>Police Capt. Chip Harding</ORGANIZATION> said . 
According to the release , the intruder was a black male between 20 and 30 years old , around 5 ' 10 " , with close cut hair and was wearing a sleeveless , light-colored T-shirt at the time of the incident . 
Police have yet to find a motive . 
" We have no idea [ who ] it was , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
" It all happened so fast . 
He did n't say anything like ' give me your money . ' 
We do n't really know what his intentions were . " 
The victim was treated at the <ORGANIZATION>University Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> emergency room and required staples . 
The incident is one of the latest in a wave of <DATE>October</DATE> burglaries in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> . 
" Breaking and entering had gone up to 55 this month , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
" Usually we see about a dozen . " 
Harding said he could offer little explanation for the rise . 
" Apparently a handful of people who do n't even know each other have just decided that this is what they 're going to do , " he said . 
" It 's very unusual . " 
Harding was reluctant to draw any connection to the serial rapist , who has been linked to the sexual assault of seven women in the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> area since <DATE>1997</DATE> . 
" The description on the serial rapist has been so varied , you ca n't say that this guy meets it , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
<LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON>David Brown</PERSON> said he is concerned about the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> 's burglary rate , but added he has no explanation of the apparent increase . 
" I do n't have any sense of what 's going on other than the fact that these things sometimes happen in clusters , " <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said . 
Despite the recent increase in burglaries , <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said crime in general in the <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> is not increasing . 
" If you look at the bigger picture of our crime statistics , most of our violent crime rates have been declining steadily , " he said . 
Nonetheless , <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said he believes that <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> citizens must discuss ways to improve neighborhood watches and counter crime . 
" I think the issue of our community having not caught the serial rapist is one we need to address , " he said . 
" We need to have a community where women are safe . " 
University of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> sociology professor <PERSON>Donald Black</PERSON> , author of <ORGANIZATION>Sociological Justice</ORGANIZATION> , said he believes the increase in burglaries may reflect a change in the patterns of police reporting or may be the result of an isolated crime spree perpetrated by a limited number of individuals . 
Whether or not a crime is reported often depends on social status and the relationship between victim and assailant , <PERSON>Black</PERSON> said . 
" The social nature of the crime affects whether the officer is likely to treat it officially , " Black said . 
" Higher status people are more likely to have their burglaries reported , adding that frequently , victims have had previous relationships with their assailants . " 
If the burglary actually has increased , Black hypothesized the crimes are limited to a few perpetrators . 
" It 's probably just three friends who are on a spree or something , " he said . 
" It does n't make sense that it would be a bunch of individuals would just decide to go out and burglarize . " 
Either way , <PERSON>Black</PERSON> said he does not believe the crime rate increase to be significant . 
" You have this kind of crazy reaction to rising rates sometimes , " Black said . 
" But who knows whether that was real or if it just has something to do with the reporting ? "
