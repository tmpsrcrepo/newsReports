The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> released a revised interim Policy on Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment and Other Forms of Interpersonal Violence <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> . 
The 18 page interim policy describes reporting options , specific procedures under the policy and distinctions between reporting and procedural options for both students and <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employees . 
In an email sent to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> said the new policy outlines new practices to encourage reporting and participation , details due-process protections for students and employees and shows the support of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> for all members of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
To encourage reporting , the interim policy includes expanded resources to guide members of the community to participate more in helping contain and eradicate sexual violence at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The new interim policy describes prohibited conduct as sexual assault , sexual exploitation , intimate partner violence , stalking , sexual or gender-based harassment , complicity in the commission of any act prohibited by this policy and retaliation against a person for the good faith reporting of any of these forms of conduct or participation in any investigation or proceeding under this policy . 
If employees or students violate the new policy , they may face disciplinary action up to and including termination or expulsion . 
The procedures for reporting , investigating and resolving prohibited conduct differ depending on one 's relationship with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> - whether they are a student , employee or third party . 
<PERSON>Matt Charles</PERSON> , a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> spokesperson , said the new policy " supports the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's ongoing efforts to provide a safe and non-discriminatory environment on Grounds . " 
The previous policy - called the Policy and Procedures for Student Sexual Misconduct Complaints - was last revised <DATE>July 8 , 2011</DATE> . 
Changes to the existing policy were requested and began about a year ago , and an online forum was established for the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community to publicly comment on a revised student policy from <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE> to <DATE>Dec. 20 , 2014</DATE> . 
" Preliminary planning for this policy began during the <DATE>spring of 2014</DATE> , " <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> said in an email . 
" Nearly 600 individuals responded to the draft of a revised student policy shared with the community in <DATE>November 2014</DATE> . " 
After reviewing all the responses , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> began developing the interim policy . 
<PERSON>Charles</PERSON> said the development of this interim policy considered the impact of evolving federal and state law , improvements to procedures and practices based on the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's experience with the prior policy over the past several years , trauma-informed approaches and training and fair and impartial proceedings based upon due process . 
Some of the key changes for students in the new policy include an improved <ORGANIZATION>Student Resource Guide</ORGANIZATION> providing information for counseling and support , new reporting options - such as the anonymous online reporting system " Just Report It " - and changes in the <ORGANIZATION>University Resolution Process</ORGANIZATION> . 
The interim policy provides two forms of resolution in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> resolution process - a formal resolution , which involves an investigation and hearing , or an alternative resolution , which involves other practices to " eliminate , prevent , and address the effects of prohibited conduct . 
Significant changes in the formal resolution process now include the process of sanctioning . 
The policy explicitly states " some behavior is so egregious in nature , harmful to the individuals involved or so deleterious to the educational process that it requires severe sanctions , including suspension or expulsion from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . " 
The alternative resolution was also expanded to clarify that the it may not be available when certain risk factors identified during the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's threat assessment are present . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said the interim policy will be open to continued review over the coming months , but that it is important to have a policy in place to address the needs and concerns of the community . 
" We expect additional revisions to the policy in the coming months as we receive input and recommendations from internal and external reviews , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" Pending legislation from the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> General Assembly may also require further revisions to the policy . 
It is , however , essential that we have a revised policy in place now to serve the needs of our community and address current legal requirements under Title IX , the Clery Act , and the Violence Against Women Act . "
