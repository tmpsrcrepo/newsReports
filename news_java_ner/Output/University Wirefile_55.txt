Say no to drugs , or the government may take your financial aid away because of a law the <ORGANIZATION>Drug Reform Coordination Network</ORGANIZATION> is now working to overturn . 
A provision in the Higher Education Act , signed into law <DATE>Oct. 7</DATE> , will terminate eligibility for federal financial aid for at least one year if a student is convicted of possession or sale of a controlled substance . 
In response , the DRCNet has begun a campaign spreading awareness of the law among college students in hopes of overturning it . 
Still , awareness of this provision at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> is low . 
" A lot of people do n't know the law is out there and it 's going to be in effect soon , " <ORGANIZATION>DRCNet University</ORGANIZATION> Coordinator <PERSON>Kris Lotlikar</PERSON> said . 
DRCNet -- a group of 6,000 activists that pushes for " drug policy reform , " has criticized the provision because of a racial and economic bias , Associate Director <PERSON>Adam J. Smith</PERSON> said . 
" The reality is that what it 's going to do is discriminate " against blacks and lower income students , <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said . 
However , the provision will not affect student financial aid until the next academic year , he said . 
Rep. <PERSON>Mark Souder</PERSON> , <LOCATION>R-Ind.</LOCATION> , introduced the provision last <DATE>spring</DATE> . 
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said <PERSON>Souder</PERSON> was trying to send a message to his white constituency , providing a " get tough non-solution . " 
" It only affects you if you 're poor or earn middle income , " he said . 
Angela Flood , <PERSON>Souder</PERSON> 's deputy chief of staff , said that the provision intends no racial bias . 
The nation 's taxpayers should not be supporting students who are being convicted on drug charges , Flood said . 
" There has to be some accountability , " she said . 
But <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> contends the law hurts people who are trying to rebuild their life and go to college after a previous drug conviction . 
He cited statistics stating that blacks comprise <PERCENT>12 percent</PERCENT> of the nation 's population , <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT> of the nation 's drug users and <PERCENT>55 percent</PERCENT> of all drug convictions . 
" No other class of offense impacts financial aid , " <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said . 
He also noted convicted stalkers and rapists are still eligible for aid . 
Flood said the law is not retroactive , and prior convictions do not affect aid . 
" This applies only if you are convicted while receiving aid , " she said . 
Working primarily over the Internet , DRCNet is coordinating student efforts to overturn the provision . 
Souder was " counting on the fact that college students would n't do anything . 
We 've seen a pretty good response , " <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said . 
DRCNet support has grown to include students at close to 100 colleges , <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said . 
DRCNet 's push to overturn the law will be an uphill battle on the financial front as well . 
" We 're running out of money , " <PERSON>Lotlikar</PERSON> said . 
But <PERSON>Lotlikar</PERSON> remains optimistic about the future of the campaign . 
" We have a pretty good membership and we 've gotten a lot of donations . 
We 'll figure out a way around it , " he said . 
Despite opposition to the provision , Flood does not think it will be overturned in the near future . 
" I think they have a very tough case , " she said .
