I THOUGHT I had heard it all . 
President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> 's sex scandal brought women out of the woodwork and set media outlets aflutter , but it looked like we had successfully eroded the boundaries of good taste for the last time . 
Nothing more could shock or infuriate me . 
That is , of course , until I flipped to <TIME>MSNBC last night</TIME> and discovered a forum : " Women : Will you stand by your President ? " 
How far is the media willing to descend and how much longer will society remain tolerant ? 
MSNBC , quickly becoming the " all scandal , all the time " network , obviously has n't tired of exploring every sordid detail and possible angle to the story . 
But it 's one thing to report on breaking events -- <PERSON>Kathleen Willey</PERSON> 's accusations , grand jury testimony , etc . 
It 's quite a different matter , however , to create news . 
That 's exactly what MSNBC is doing with its so-called chats and forums . 
What exactly does women standing or not standing by the president have to do with what really happened ? 
Which , I may add , still is not clear . 
The language the sex scandal inspires , though , is even more disturbing . 
The public increasingly enjoys defining what constitutes sex and parents all over the country are faced with the delicate task of answering their childrens ' questions about oral sex . 
As <PERSON>Tammy Wynette</PERSON> 's " Stand By Your Man " played in my head , I heard terms used to describe <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> like " sexual predator " bandied about the MSNBC forum . 
Excuse me ? 
<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> may indeed be a jerk -- a slimeball , an adulterer , a sleaze and far too smooth for his own good -- but is n't it an overstatement to brand him a sexual predator ? 
At the heart of the matter , of course , lies our conception of morality and integrity . 
I heard one puritanical commentator decry the state of a society that gives a cheating president high approval ratings . 
Let 's get off our moral high horses and take a reality check . 
Adultery , no matter how morally repugnant , has existed throughout the history of our country . 
Is <PERSON>Franklin Roosevelt</PERSON> any less a great president because he engaged in an affair with woman after his marriage began ? 
Did his indiscretions affect the way he led the country ? 
Does anyone not support his presidential actions because of his philandering ? 
No . 
<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> 's job performance is n't affected by his affairs . 
It 's hurt by the constant media barrage directed at his personal life . 
American society demands a lot from its political leaders . 
We expect them to be god-like -- brilliant , well-educated , poised and well-spoken . 
At the same time , however , we demand a man of the people . 
Someone who can relate to the problems of everyday citizens -- who addresses their concerns and relates to their lives . 
But if a politician fails to live up to their extremely high standards and acts very much like an everyday person -- human -- society disowns him . 
They learn a difficult lesson in finding that their god has clay feet . 
In the current situation , the public seems to support <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> . 
Though the majority of the nation indicate they believe he committed the sexual improprieties , his approval rating has gone up . 
This is a signal that perhaps Americans just do n't care . 
The economy is doing well , the country seems to run on course and the American people are using his job performance as criteria to judge him . 
The media , however , has taken hold of the story and will not let go . 
While they madly defend their never-ending coverage by calling it a serious discussion of the accusations against the president , the media focus seems instead to center on the latest fodder in the gossip mill . 
It seems strange that an industry that takes great pains to explain its increasingly diluted coverage as " giving the public what it wants , " would continue to harp on a story that so many are tired of hearing about . 
Despite the many polls professing society 's indifference , a market for this tabloid-style journalism still exists . 
It reflects poorly on our society that one can approach a random group of people and conduct an in-depth discussion of the ins and outs of the scandal , yet very few people could speak intelligently about foreign policy initiatives . 
The media built <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> and now they are tearing him down . 
Journalism 's darling in the <DATE>1992</DATE> election , <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> now faces a press which examines his professional and personal life under the harsh lens of a microscope . 
The scandal 's the thing these days and the fallout the story of choice . 
Much of the media has set an agenda and society 's willingness to follow helps perpetuate a shift away from real issues . 
There is no question that the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> scandal represented a juicy tidbit of news -- an interesting new twist in the ongoing mystery surrounding the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> . 
But the time has come for the nonsense to end and for the country and the media to concentrate on what really matters .
