<ORGANIZATION>National Public Radio</ORGANIZATION> 's " What Shapes Health " series recently revived the discussion on Adverse Childhood Experiences , a study conducted in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> by Dr. <PERSON>Vincent Felitti</PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON>Rob Anda</PERSON> . 
The study was based on the ACE test , which surveys participants for 10 different types of adverse childhood experiences - ranging from abuse to losing a parent . 
The test assigns the participant one point for every category of adverse experience they have undergone as a child . 
A higher score indicates more adverse experiences . 
Felitti and Anda report a positive correlation between participants ' childhood abuse history and negative health outcomes such as heart disease , post-traumatic stress disorder and even cancer . " 
[ A history of abuse corresponded to ] very dramatic increases in pretty much every one of the major public health problems that we 'd included in the study , " said Anda in an interview with <ORGANIZATION>NPR</ORGANIZATION> . 
Participants with an ACE score of four or higher had double the chance of heart disease . 
In younger adults , childhood trauma may correspond to psychological conditions , including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder . 
However , researchers initially responded to these findings with skepticism . 
Some were quick to point out the pivotal difference between correlation and causation . 
" An association does not necessarily mean that one thing causes the other , " said <PERSON>Sarah Floud</PERSON> , postdoctoral epidemiologist at <ORGANIZATION>Oxford University</ORGANIZATION> , in an interview with <ORGANIZATION>NPR</ORGANIZATION> . 
Third-year College student <PERSON>Tara Saunders</PERSON> , a psychology major , posed a different explanation . 
" It seems to me that the reason this research is n't ' widely known ' is because it really is n't all that helpful or new , " <PERSON>Saunders</PERSON> said . 
" We already know that all these pieces are connected to each other , but we just do n't have the evidence that trauma alone has an effect on physical health . " 
Some researchers said they have been at a loss to explain through what mechanism childhood abuse can cause illnesses such as cancer . 
Others said they believe the answer may lie in the impairment of executive function , or judgment , due to abuse . " 
[ When executive function is impaired ] you 're less able to tell yourself not to eat the ice cream , or smoke the cigarette or have that additional drink , " said <PERSON>Megan Gunnar</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>University of Minnesota</ORGANIZATION> psychology department chair . 
This impairment of judgment may negatively affect health outcomes . 
Researchers like <PERSON>Gunnar</PERSON> are returning to <PERSON>Felitti</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Anda</ORGANIZATION> 's findings and hypothesize they will find the aetiology of adult health outcomes in childhood abuse . 
The findings indicate a history of abuse corresponds to a lower health outcome throughout a person 's life . 
These may be the ripple effects of childhood sexual abuse . 
Asst. Psychology Prof. <PERSON>Noelle Hurd</PERSON> believes said she believes <PERSON>Felitti</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Anda</ORGANIZATION> 's findings have a bearing on adulthood . 
" As a researcher who is interested in prevention and intervention , I think these findings underscore the need for greater efforts at preventing childhood trauma but also highlight the need for greater supports to adults who have experienced abuse , neglect or household dysfunction in childhood , " <PERSON>Hurd</PERSON> said . 
Hurd 's research analyzes levels of student adjustment to college life . 
She said she believes support networks for adults and young adults may counteract the effects of childhood abuse . 
" Social support and mental health services have the potential to help adults process and heal from earlier traumas which , according to the findings from the ACE study , may yield important benefits to adults ' mental and physical health , " <PERSON>Hurd</PERSON> said .
