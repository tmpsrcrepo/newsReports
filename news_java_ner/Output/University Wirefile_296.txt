<LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> is for real . 
It might seem like a far away state that has little relevance to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students , but the state 's new law banning almost all abortions has serious implications for every young woman in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> . 
The law allows for abortion when the mother 's life is endangered , but prohibits all other abortions , even in cases of rape , incest and danger to the mother 's health . 
The movement represented by <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> 's new law has been eroding reproductive rights for decades , and <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> appointments of <PERSON>John Roberts</PERSON> and <PERSON>Samuel Alito</PERSON> should make us afraid for the future . 
The women of <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> are facing that reality as the legal challenges begin . 
The ban will not take effect unless <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> upholds the law , but of course , that 's exactly the point . 
Architects of the ban are hoping that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's new appointees will vote to overturn the precedent of <PERSON>Roe v. Wade</PERSON> , opening the door for likeminded state legislators to make all abortions illegal in other states . 
Considering the social conservatism of our own <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> , the young women of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> should take this possibility very seriously . 
Residents of states with solidly pro-choice legislators might not be immediately affected by the overturn of <PERSON>Roe v. Wade</PERSON> , but the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> routinely considers bills that would restrict the access of women to abortion clinics and even to contraceptives . 
It 's important to understand that the end of legal abortion would not mean the end of abortions but a return to underground , unregulated clinics and life-threatening attempts by desperate women . 
We have all seen the coat hanger as a chilling symbol of illegal abortions , but most college students are too young to remember the years before the <PERSON>Roe v. Wade</PERSON> decision . 
Ask your mothers and your grandmothers what happened to women before <DATE>1973</DATE> -- what happened to their female friends or their college roommates when unwanted pregnancies occurred . 
Instructions on how to perform an illegal abortion have already circulated online in response to <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> 's new law . 
A blogger calling herself <PERSON>Molly Blythe</PERSON> made headlines when she posted a graphic guide for do-it-yourself abortions intended for women who would lose access to legal clinics under a ban . 
It might be premature to worry about women attempting such a procedure on their own , but the instructions are a reminder of what women will attempt without access to legal clinics . 
For years , the abortion issue has rallied the Christian Right in support of the Republican party , butRepublicans might find themselves losing popularity with the wider public if abortion bans become a reality . 
While many Americans feel conflicted about late term abortions and abortions for economic reasons , strong majorities support the right to first term abortions and abortions performed to save the life or health of the mother . 
Even in <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> , there are signs that the public is unhappy with the new law . 
According to a SurveyUSA poll , the approval rating for <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> gov. <PERSON>Mike Rounds</PERSON> dropped from <PERCENT>72 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>58 percent</PERCENT> after he signed the ban into law . 
A national poll conducted by <ORGANIZATION>FOX News/Opinion Dynamics</ORGANIZATION> found that <PERCENT>59 percent</PERCENT> of Americans would oppose a similar ban in their own states . 
Yet despite popular support for legal abortions , Democratic leaders have been unwilling to protect women 's rights . 
Several ostensibly " pro-choice " senators failed women when they had the chance to stop anti-choice nominees from reaching <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> . 
In refusing to support a filibuster of <PERSON>Samuel Alito</PERSON> , the Democrats sacrificed women 's reproductive rights in order to save themselves from the political fallout of actually standing for something . 
These senators should not receive another dime from pro-choice advocacy groups ; their professed views are irrelevant when they are unwilling to take risks for women 's rights . 
Unfortunately , we cannnot count on the <ORGANIZATION>United States Congress</ORGANIZATION> to protect women 's rights . 
And we can no longer rely on the courts now that <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> has two nominees from President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> . 
The pressure has to come from us . 
Our leaders need to hear from women who value reproductive rights , and from men who care about the women in their lives . 
Leaders who fail to protect those rights must be kicked out of office at the state and the national levels because we can no longer afford their lack of action .
