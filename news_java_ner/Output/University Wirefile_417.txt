The academic expectations at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> are rigorous , but above all else , our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is known for its high expectations of the student body in regards to their honor . 
The famous student-enforced Honor system at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> presents cases to juries of students who decide the fate of the accused . 
This process puts the power of the Honor Code in the hands of the student body , where it is often held with the utmost regard . 
It is a common belief that " letting slide " one offense puts into question the honor of the entire University as a whole , and therefore we have established the " one and done " single-sanction policy . 
This somewhat controversial method has again and again been defended by the student body as a staple of the culture that forms the ties of our community at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
As such an integral aspect of the academic culture at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , why does this belief not extend to the processes set up to handle sexual misconduct ? 
An estimated <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of college-aged women have experienced a sexual assault . 
What honorable measures has our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> taken to protect its students from becoming part of this statistic ? 
It has developed the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> ( SMB ) , which is " a body of faculty , professional staff , and students who are trained to apply the Sexual Misconduct Policy ... [ and ] delegated the authority to hear and resolve all complaints brought under the Sexual Misconduct Policy . " 
Often when a student reports an incident , she is encouraged to go through a form of mediation with the accused attacker , or to file a case with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
This seems like a viable outlet for a survivor to talk through an experience and seek the justice necessary for closure . 
However , the lack of serious consequences resulting from adjudication in the cases heard thus far makes it difficult to hold this <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> in as high esteem . 
Is it " honorable " for the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to handle sexual misconduct cases internally , rather than turning them over to the criminal justice system , which could file more serious felony charges ? 
The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> estimates that only <PERCENT>2-8 percent</PERCENT> of reported sexual assault allegations are false or unfounded . 
Additionally , our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is obligated by Title IX to adjudicate sexual misconduct cases based on a " preponderance " of evidence , rather than the " clear and convincing " approach that is currently utilized by some institutions . 
Given these facts , it seems incredible that the <ORGANIZATION>SMB</ORGANIZATION> has not heard a single case that should have warranted expulsion . 
In fact , if we look at the history of the twenty-two cases heard by the <ORGANIZATION>SMB</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1998</DATE> , we see that 11 were found not guilty , 10 were found guilty , and one even admitted his guilt . 
However , no student has been asked to leave for sexual misconduct in the past ten years . 
How can we so easily dismiss students for lying or cheating when perpetrators of sexual offenses remain here completely untarnished ? 
How is it feasible that cheaters and liars are forever labeled and mistrusted by our community from one incident , but sexual offenders receive ( barely ) a slap on the wrist ? 
Does it make sense that - at a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> where this policy has led to the so-called " Community of Trust " that grants students the peace of mind to leave their laptops unwatched in our libraries - the Honor system does not extend to the personal safety of walking home alone after dark ? 
Clearly we see what is considered important in <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> culture . 
The policies of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> failed to comply with this " preponderance of evidence " law until <DATE>May 2011</DATE> . 
Despite these changes , an accuser still requires a unanimous decision from the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> for a guilty adjudication . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> recently placed the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> under review for its sexual misconduct policies . 
The concern of our national <ORGANIZATION>Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> , paired with the testimonies of various students and the culture of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> as a whole , points to cracks in the system that need to be filled . 
At a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> that places such an intense focus on " honor , " one would think that an honor offense of the most severe nature would warrant the expulsion that copying French homework does , but this is clearly not the case . 
Do we need to mandate a policy where all students must sign an " Honor Pledge " after each term stating , " On my honor as a student , I have neither committed nor attempted rape during this semester " for the Honor Code to apply to sexual assault ? 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> needs a serious reevaluation of the systems set up to handle sexual misconduct cases . 
We - as members of this community - should be more aware of the offenses that occur and the processes executed to deal with them . 
This lack of honor at the hands of our own <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , in the face of the stringent expectation placed upon students , creates a wedge of injustice that lodges in the deepest core of the foundation of our institution . 
Our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should be striving to protect its students , not its name . 
I hope to further instigate an open and honest dialogue within our community about the reality of sexual misconduct and how it is handled at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
As <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> said , " A little rebellion now and then is a good thing , and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical . "
