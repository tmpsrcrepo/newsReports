In a terrible tragedy , a six-day search for a dog left aboard a crippled ship in the <LOCATION>Pacific Ocean</LOCATION> has been called off -- the tragedy being that the rescue operation cost an astounding <MONEY>$ 50,000</MONEY> . 
This very Enronesque operation is the latest in a string of stories that show the incredible lengths to which society goes to save its animals . 
The issue is that animals are increasingly being treated far better than American citizens themselves are . 
The legal system harshly punishes animal abusers , while movies and television shows depict crimes against children with far greater regularity than they depict animals getting hurt , and society in general is focusing more on animal rights than human rights . 
The amount of time and money going into saving a single dog lost at sea is disturbing , but even more so is the way that society treats rapists , pedophiles and killers better than it treats animal abusers . 
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> 's " animal serial killer , " <PERSON>Robert Pettyjohn</PERSON> , currently is serving 10 years in prison for killing a bull with a bow and arrow and now faces 15 years for his savage beating and mutilation of a pair of llamas . 
His crimes are horrid and depraved , but compare him to the pedophile priests who sexually abuse and psychologically cripple the young boys they are sworn to aid . 
Or the basketball coach facing one to two years for groping one of his young players . 
Or the man sentenced to 15 years for driving a truck loaded with propane into an abortion clinic . 
While lawyers can use legal terminology to justify these different punishments , it is necessary to reconsider the justice system when savage crimes against humans are punished with less severity than crimes against animals . 
Even <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has diverged somewhat from the concern of the human race and is focusing on bizarre and miniscule laws protecting animals . 
Last week the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> approved the addition of the Puppy Protection Act to a new farm reform bill . 
Under the new provisions , all puppies require plenty of human contact before they are put up for sale . 
Forget all the people who claim the government is an inefficient waste of taxpayers ' dollars . 
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is working for the people and enforcing the American right to " life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness " -- by ensuring that all puppies get some invaluable TLC before sale . 
Forget the 40 million or so Americans without full health insurance or the <PERCENT>5.7 percent</PERCENT> of the population that is unemployed ; our puppies need <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> ' help . 
Society has learned to accept crimes against people , yet will not stand for crimes against animals . 
A number of movies and television shows feature plot lines or critical scenes involving children being abused and killed yet stories involving animal abuse are far less pervasive . 
Every story about an animal in distress reaches the news , right down to the crazy cat lady being evicted from her apartment -- precisely because she is not allowed to have forty cats in the apartment . 
Perhaps it is that crimes against humans occur with such regularity that most horrific crimes barely reach the news . 
But the double standard might suggest something about the public 's acceptance of the reported act . 
This is not a critical deconstruction of the entertainment industry nor an examination of the actual incidence of crimes against humans versus crimes against animals . 
It is a question about the valuation of life in society when people are more willing to see <PERSON>John Travolta</PERSON> 's son murdered on a merry-go-round in " Face/Off " than it is to see <PERSON>Travolta</PERSON> 's dog get killed . 
Many would argue that a child homicide provides a more interesting and emotional story to moviegoers than the evisceration of a cow . 
Movies are able to push envelopes with sex and violence because this is acceptable as fact , but the abuse of animals in movies remains taboo . 
So rather than continuing along the middle road and protecting animals to such a degree , we should give them full citizenship . 
Farmers in <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> are now buying expensive water beds to give cows a more comfortable rest . 
As <PERSON>Arie Jongeneel</PERSON> , an <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> farmer buying into the water bed craze says , " The cows liked it right away . 
They laid right down and were comfortable , " ( " Moooove Over : Cows queue for water beds , " CNN.com , <DATE>April 8</DATE> ) . 
Why stop with water beds ? 
Every animal should be given official status as a member of <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> . 
This works out great for all the people out there who feel that society misrepresents and unfairly treats them . 
There are so many people who feel that society holds them down , resents them and restricts their upward mobility . 
Now whenever they feel under-appreciated and oppressed , they can forego protest and martyrdom because now the human race has a new subsection of society it can oppress unjustly . 
Animals can serve as the new minority and society can ignore their rights and treat them like the inferior citizens that they are . 
Animals are cute and fuzzy , and they make great ottomans as well . 
But the sensitivity given to animal rights should be applied to humans . 
Animals should be protected from torture and cruelty , but it is incongruous for society to accept cruelty toward humans more readily than toward animals simply because attacks on humans are more frequent . 
People have an inherent right to respect , and it should be afforded to all humans .
