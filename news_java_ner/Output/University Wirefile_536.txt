Manali Sontakke | The Cavalier Daily On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , <DATE>Nov. 18</DATE> , students packed the upper room of Trinity Irish Pub : not for the usual night of shenanigans , but to attend this year 's <ORGANIZATION>TEDxUVA Student Speaker Competition</ORGANIZATION> . 
TED is a nonprofit organization created in <DATE>1984</DATE> which hosts events featuring short presentations on Technology , Entertainment and Design . 
In the recent years , however , the popularity of <ORGANIZATION>TED</ORGANIZATION> talks has skyrocketed , and now the short lectures cover almost any topic which aligns with <ORGANIZATION>TED</ORGANIZATION> 's motto : " Ideas worth spreading . " 
This year , 10 student speakers - competing for a spot in the local event - gave inspiring , educational and eloquent speeches which engaged audiences . 
Following the theme " Make the Path , " talks focused on battling prejudices and encouraging the audience to consider alternative perspectives . 
Third-year College student <PERSON>Andrew Burrill</PERSON> , First-year <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Attiya Latif</PERSON> and Fourth-year College student <PERSON>John Stegner</PERSON> will speak at the official TEDxUVA event on <DATE>Feb. 22</DATE> . 
Burrill gave an emotional and personal account of the hardships he faced in his teens . 
After hitting a self-described rock bottom , <PERSON>Burrill</PERSON> was led - via joyful memories of singing with his family - to the arts . 
Burrill noticed the stigma attached to this choice - upon hearing he was involved in the arts , people would roll their eyes , claiming he would only ever work in a coffee shop . 
Burrill has proved these cynics wrong when he appeared on an episode of the TV hit " Modern Family " and performed at the <DATE>2012</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>MTV Video Music Awards</ORGANIZATION> . 
Burrill encouraged people to remain open to the arts , explaining that it is a profession which requires training and skill like any other field . 
Latif , meanwhile , countered the stereotype that her Islamic headscarf , known as a hijab , was oppressive . 
Latif argues that though the Western perception of feminism considers the hijab confining , she wears a hijab by her own choice , stating , " My scarf empowers me to be a feminist . " 
She encouraged the audience to reconsider their past assumptions about Islam and reevaluate which perspectives may be Western-centric . 
Stegner presented a talk on sexual assault . 
A member of the all-male sexual assault support group One in Four , <PERSON>Stegner</PERSON> explained : " Most men are anti-rape and anti-violence , but they just do n't have the tools to effect change . " 
<PERSON>Stegner</PERSON> emphasized the need to improve the current system of evaluating sexual assault . 
He encouraged acting with an attitude of empathy and compassion - especially towards the victims . 
Only by rejecting the modern assumptions about sexual assault can we begin better our society and make real , positive change , he said .
