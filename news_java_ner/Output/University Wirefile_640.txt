In the latest push for legalizing firearms on campus - something we have previously argued against - lawmakers in at least 10 states are arguing allowing students to carry firearms will protect them against the dangers of sexual assault . 
This is a veiled attempt at pushing a pro-gun agenda , and demonstrates a complete misunderstanding about sexual assault at colleges on the part of these representatives . 
Perhaps the most obvious flaw in the gun lobby 's argument is that allowing campus carry would not exclusively put guns in the hands of potential victims - it would also allow assaulters to legally carry guns on campus . 
Potential rapists would now have a new tool in their arsenal with which to attack . 
But aside from this obvious lapse in logic , the idea that guns would affect rates of sexual assault demonstrates how little legislators understand the fundamentals of sexual assault on campus . 
College women , according to <ORGANIZATION>The New York Times</ORGANIZATION> , are typically assaulted by someone they know , making them likely reluctant to use a gun against their attackers . 
There is also the question of whether individuals will even have access to guns in an instance of assault - would a typical student realistically carry his or her gun to a party ? 
Even if the answer to that question is yes , this presents its own set of problems . 
With binge drinking at parties , the chance of gun accidents would be high . 
<PERSON>John Thrasher</PERSON> , president of <ORGANIZATION>Florida State University</ORGANIZATION> , is a vocal gun rights supporter who opposes guns on campuses . 
This is due to the death of a student in <DATE>2011</DATE> who was shot and killed when another student , showing his friends his rifle , shot the student when he did n't realize his weapon was loaded . 
Add alcohol and the general recklessness of a college environment , and the potential for more stories in a similar vein is high . 
One rape survivor , <PERSON>Amanda Collins</PERSON> , has stood on the pro-gun side of this debate , claiming that her <DATE>2007</DATE> rape at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Nevada</ORGANIZATION> - in which a stranger pinned her down and pressed his own gun to her head - could have been avoided had she been carrying her licensed gun . 
Survivors should always have a significant presence in debates surrounding sexual assault , and the value of their perspective can not be overstated . 
<PERSON>Collins</PERSON> ' own story is haunting , and her points are persuasive . 
But <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> ' personal example is not representative of the majority of campus sexual assaults , which tend to happen between individuals who know each other and not in unfamiliar settings . 
Moreover , there is truly no way to know if having a gun in those circumstances would prevent these violent acts from happening - no matter how good a shot someone is . 
It appears lawmakers are taking advantage of the widespread attention the very serious issue of sexual assault is receiving in order to further their own agenda . 
This is not befitting of the elected positions they hold . 
Campus sexual assault is a national problem that requires serious analysis in order to achieve real solutions for the men and women affected by it . 
It is obvious lawmakers have particular constituents in mind when they push these bills - but not the ones they claim to have in mind .
