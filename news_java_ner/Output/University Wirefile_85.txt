The green flyers placed around <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Newcomb Hall Dining Room</ORGANIZATION> attracted students ' eyes with their bright color at first , but their message would attract controversy as well : " Why are certain factions ( the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> and feminists ) engaged in an assault against things that make life pleasurable , such as : sex , romance , makeup , furs , jewelry , chocolate ? " 
The flyer advertised " The Neo-Puritan Assault on Sex and Pleasure " with Dr. <PERSON>Gary Hull</PERSON> as lecturer , sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>Objectivist Club</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in <ORGANIZATION>Gilmer Hall</ORGANIZATION> . 
Objectivism is a philosophy emphasizing individual achievement , formulated by the author <PERSON>Ayn Rand</PERSON> in her <DATE>1943</DATE> book " The Fountainhead " and <DATE>1957</DATE> book " Atlas Shrugged . " 
According to <PERSON>Hull</PERSON> , the basis of the philosophy 's morality is reason . 
" I would say objectivism is a philosophy of reason , egoism and capitalism , " said <PERSON>Dan Norton</PERSON> , third-year College student and <ORGANIZATION>Objectivist Club</ORGANIZATION> president . 
" As corollaries to that we reject faith , self-sacrifice , statism and collectivism . " 
Hull is one of several lecturers affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION>Ayn Rand Institute</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Ayn Rand Institute</ORGANIZATION> is the main center for the advancement of objectivism in today 's culture , <PERSON>Norton</PERSON> said . 
The institute sponsors a high school essay contest , college clubs and a speakers bureau , and has a number of lecturers who speak around the nation , <PERSON>Norton</PERSON> said . 
The club was interested in having a speaker from the <ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION> , and <PERSON>Hull</PERSON> was available , he said . 
Hull began his lecture <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> with what he called " a parental advisory . 
" Warning : The following material might be unsuitable for those of you who enjoy sex and pleasure , " <PERSON>Hull</PERSON> said . 
Hull 's speech dealt with the attitudes toward sex held by certain social movements in today 's society and their philosophical origins . 
Hull also placed his comments in the context of his Objectivist philosophy . 
In his lecture , <PERSON>Hull</PERSON> claimed a movement is afoot across the ideological spectrum -- from " religionists " to feminists and environmentalists -- to curtail pleasure . 
" If it brings pleasure , do n't do it , " he said . 
" We are seeing a pincer movement -- two armies are converging to suffocate an individual 's enjoyment of life . " 
Hull noted several forms of pleasure that have been attacked . 
Among them , he claimed , were sports cars , jewelry , popcorn , laughter , smoking and stereos . 
Central to <PERSON>Hull</PERSON> 's argument , however , was the role of sex in society . 
" For centuries , Catholicism has been shoving misery down humanity 's throat , " he said . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> and secular groups such as feminists and environmentalists " say that sex is intrinsically evil , but most people are too weak to resist , " he added . 
" As wrong as the Christians were , at least they believed there was something in each person worth saving , " <PERSON>Hull</PERSON> said . 
" Today 's Neo-Puritans have taken Platonism and Christianity to their consistent , logical conclusion . " 
According to <PERSON>Hull</PERSON> , the Neo-Puritans use three tactics to further their goals : sexual harassment lawsuits , a " flabby , undefined concept of rape " and so-called dating codes . 
Hull derided the definition of sexual harassment as any action or speech that creates " an intimidating , hostile or offensive environment . 
" This is so non-objective and elastic , it can be applied to any action or speech , " he said . 
" The charge of sexual harassment is the <DATE>20th century</DATE> 's version of heresy . " 
While <PERSON>Hull</PERSON> noted that rape is " a hideous crime , " he said the proper definition of rape is " sex obtained by force or credible threat of force . " 
On some college campuses , Hull claims , charges can be filed if the victim was " verbally coerced . 
" If rape is ' verbal coercion ' ... then ' I want you ' is the same as ' Do me or die , ' " he said . 
Hull also blamed anti-pleasure attitudes on <PERSON>Immanuel Kant</PERSON> , the <DATE>18th century</DATE> German philosopher who <PERSON>Hull</PERSON> said " rules the world . 
" The essence of Neo-Puritanism is nihilism fused with subjectivism , " he said . 
" Christianity is absolutely inimical , harmful , and destructive to Western Culture . " 
Hull 's lecture attracted more than just members of the <ORGANIZATION>Objectivist Club</ORGANIZATION> . 
Although <PERSON>Norton</PERSON> said most club meetings attract 30 to 35 people , <PERSON>Brian Salomon</PERSON> , third-year Engineering student and <ORGANIZATION>Objectivist Club</ORGANIZATION> vice president , said <DATE>Thursday</DATE> 's lecture attracted about 90 . 
" Dr. <PERSON>Hull</PERSON> was impressed with the number of people we got , " <PERSON>Salomon</PERSON> said . 
He said he was pleased with <PERSON>Hull</PERSON> 's lecture . 
" I liked the talk a lot , " he added . 
" I thought he did a good job . " 
However , not all members of the audience were sympathetic to Hull 's views . 
Several audience members left during the question and answer period . 
" I was surprised at how hostile the audience was , " <PERSON>Salomon</PERSON> said . 
Although he could not specifically cite an instance of Neo-Puritanism at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , he said he believes it is present . 
" I get a general feeling that there is a support for feminism and environmentalism groups , " he added . 
" Those types of groups are very vocal . " 
Areshini Pather , <ORGANIZATION>University National Organization for Women</ORGANIZATION> president , attended <PERSON>Hull</PERSON> 's speech and asked questions , which she said <PERSON>Hull</PERSON> dismissed as " feminist gibberish " as several audience members laughed and clapped . 
" I would like to stress that it 's important to see different views , " <PERSON>Pather</PERSON> said . 
But " the violation of a woman is hardly anything someone should be laughing about . " 
Hull claimed that rape and sexual harassment laws were anti-pleasure and subjective , and he denigrated audience members with different views , she said . 
" I was horrified , " she added . 
" I felt it was a very tense atmosphere . " 
Second-year College student <ORGANIZATION>Elizabeth Render</ORGANIZATION> heard about the speech though the e-mail list for the <ORGANIZATION>Objectivist Club</ORGANIZATION> and attended Hull 's lecture . 
" I personally agreed with parts of what he had to say , " Render said . 
But Render was raised a Catholic , and she said she did not agree with his assessment of the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I just think he had a few ideas wrong , especially concerning sexuality in the Catholic faith , " she added . 
" I agree with a lot of the philosophy of Objectivism , but it 's kind of hard to go all the way with Objectivism . "
