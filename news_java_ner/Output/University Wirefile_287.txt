A bill that would escalate the penalties for repeated peeping convictions made it on <DATE>Monday</DATE> to the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> 's full committee on <ORGANIZATION>Courts of Justice</ORGANIZATION> , said <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> ( <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> ) Police Chief <PERSON>Timothy Longo</PERSON> . 
The bill , if passed , would charge someone convicted of three peeping offenses with a class-six felony , as opposed to the current law which charges all offenses with a class-one misdemeanor . 
The bill would also require the criminal to register as a sex offender , Assistant Commonwealth Attorney <PERSON>Ronald M. Huber</PERSON> said . 
Currently a class-1 misdemeanor carries a maximum sentence of 12 months in jail regardless of how many times the offense is repeated , while a class-6 felony carries a maximum penalty of five years , <PERSON>Huber</PERSON> said . 
A number of Commonwealth statutes , including petty larceny and indecent exposure , carry a felony charge for repeated offenses , <PERSON>Huber</PERSON> said . 
" This is the only sexual crime that does not currently carry a felony charge for a third offense , " Albemarle Delegate <PERSON>Rob Bell</PERSON> said . 
The bill would also require these new registered sex offenders to submit their DNA to the state offices , <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> said . 
Putting offenders ' DNA in the database would give the police an important new tool that would certainly aid in future investigations , <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> said . 
With this new provision , <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> said the police could immediately attempt to match DNA found at crime scenes to the information in the database . 
According to <LOCATION>Longo</LOCATION> , there is a common misconception that peepers are relatively harmless , but the police have studies that show that peeping can be a precursor to more violent sexual crimes . 
" One concern is that this is a gateway crime , " <PERSON>Bell</PERSON> said . 
" Peepers can progress to burglary and eventually sexual assault . " 
In particular , <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> said , the new bill would aid in catching the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> serial rapist because several analyses indicate that he stalks his victims before his behavior escalates to rape . 
The bill , originally conceived by <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Sergeant Wendy Lewis</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>2001</DATE> , failed when voted on by the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly 's Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>2003</DATE> and then failed again in <DATE>2004</DATE> , <PERSON>Huber</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Longo</PERSON> said he attributes the bill 's failure in the <ORGANIZATION>Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> to the approximate <MONEY>$ 240,000</MONEY> cost associated with the imprisonment of the additional felons . 
Bell said he is hopeful the bill will pass this year because , unlike previous years , there is currently a budget surplus and the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> is reviewing all of the sexual assault statutes in the state and proposing a lot of new initiatives .
