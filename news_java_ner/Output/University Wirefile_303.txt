OVER THE course of the past few years , reports of abuses perpetrated by soldiers in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> have filled our newspapers and television screens . 
While some have claimed the media harps on these atrocities , television and print media sources have all but ignored the rape and sexual assault of hundreds of young girls by military recruiters on the home front . 
Although the media largely failed to take notice , a recently released <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> report states that over 100 such abuses occurred in <DATE>2005</DATE> . 
In order to prevent such abuses in the future , the recruiting system must limit access to high school students ' personal information and ensure that no recruiters are left alone with potential enlistees . 
The report , produced by Pulitzer Prize-winner <PERSON>Martha Mendoza</PERSON> , found that , in <DATE>2005</DATE> alone , more than 80 recruiters faced disciplinary action for sexual misconduct with potential enlistees . 
It also found that since <DATE>1996</DATE> , 722 <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> recruiters have been accused of rape and sexual misconduct . 
It is likely , of course , that the number of reported cases is far lower than the actual number of incidents . 
While not all recruiters are corrupt , the problem of sexual harassment is neither new nor isolated . 
In fact , the unique powers given to a recruiter lend themselves to abuse . 
First , thanks to a nefarious clause in <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's " No Child Left Behind " policy , schools are required to provide recruiters with students ' personal information , including addresses and phone numbers , in order to receive federal funding . 
That information , coupled with the position of power that a recruiter occupies , makes it all too easy for a recruiter to prey on vulnerable girls . 
One <ORGANIZATION>Indiana National Guard</ORGANIZATION> recruiter has now been charged with raping several girls whom he specifically targeted because their lack of a father figure made them more vulnerable to someone in a position of authority . 
According to the AP report , some recruiters actually told their victims that if they wanted to join the <ORGANIZATION>Marines</ORGANIZATION> , they would have to have sex with the recruiters . 
For lower-income girls who may see the military as their only hope for either college or a successful career , this sort of ultimatum presents little choice . 
Furthermore , once victims enter the military , they might fear that exposing their recruiters as rapists could potentially damage their own careers . 
The requirements and responsiblities of recruiters produce a " perfect storm " wherein prime conditions for abusers and victims meet , creating the perfect environment for rapists . 
With conditions so conducive to sexual harassment , that fact that only one in every 200 recruiters is disciplined for sexual misconduct is no accident . 
The military 's reaction to the AP report has been predictable ; as with countless other abuse reports , the military insists that it is dealing with the problem appropriately , citing a determination to discipline its own members . 
Discipline from within the military , however , has not yet prevented such abuse and will not erase the damage already done to countless young girls . 
There are two obvious steps which should be taken to prevent further cases of harassment . 
First , in order to prevent recruiters from targeting specific girls , the " No Child Left Behind " provision requiring schools to provide information must be repealed . 
No matter how desperate the military is for recruits , such an infringement upon students ' right to privacy is not justified . 
Private employers are not permitted access to such information , precisely because they are likely to abuse it . 
The military should be no exception . 
Proponents of the program claim that a student 's parent or guardian may opt out of it if they wish . 
This argument fails on two counts . 
First , students are largely unaware of this option , despite a stipulation in the law that requires schools to inform students of this right . 
Second , even a high school student can not opt out unless his or her parents or guardians agree . 
Thus , a student is not really free to make his or her own decision to keep personal information private . 
Unfortunately , even eliminating the military 's ability to obtain personal information would not be enough to protect girls who seek out recruiters on their own . 
Even if the government refuses to give up the military 's access to personal information , it must implement a policy similar to the one instituted by the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> in response to the rapes in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> 's policy , which forbids recruiters from being alone with female enlistees , has already shown positive results . 
A " No One Alone " policy , as suggested by Congressman <PERSON>Ike Skelton</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> , is simple , but it is a good start towards responsible recruitment . 
There is no reason for the military not to introduce such a policy universally because it would cost nothing and could only improve recruiting efforts . 
Mr. <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> himself advised a young <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> that a standing army would pose a threat of abuse . 
Unfortunately , the very standing military against which <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> warned has been a reality for over a half-century now . 
The government must hold the military accountable to the people by removing individuals ' ability to abuse the power they are given . 
The almost systematic rape of young women in recruiters ' offices is inexcusable , but so is the military 's reluctance to do anything about it .
