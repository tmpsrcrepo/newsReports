After witnessing the <ORGANIZATION>April Fools</ORGANIZATION> ' debacle at our paper , I 've experienced mixed emotions . 
I sympathize with the black and Native American students who felt that the <ORGANIZATION>April Fools</ORGANIZATION> ' articles trivialized their experiences . 
But I also understand that The Cavalier Daily approached the issue with the good intention of highlighting important issues such as Alcoholic Beverage Control agent violence and the offensive nature of racist-themed parties . 
These articles were not malicious . 
They were simply bad pieces of satire that demonstrated a lack of awareness . 
Unfortunately , at no point along the editing chain did anybody stop to consider that these articles would be met with outrage and a feeling that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's leading publication had wronged its students . 
Aside from <DATE>April</DATE> Fools ' , I think The Cavalier Daily 's writers have done a superb job of reporting on issues sensitive to black communities such as the bloody arrest of <ORGANIZATION>Martese Johnson</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> 's editorials and commentary on such issues have been wonderful . 
What happened last week was not the fault of any particular individual . 
It was the result of a staff and leadership team that lacks significant numbers of black writers , editors and leaders . 
Imagine if a writer from The Cavalier Daily had produced a satirical news piece about a sexual assault following the rape controversy that gripped the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> last semester . 
Would The Cavalier Daily have decided to run it if it used misogynistic language analogous to " Strong Buffalo " and " Trail of Schmears " in the article about <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> agents and Native Americans ? 
Probably not , because with an all-female <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> and a significant amount of female membership , somewhere along the editing chain somebody would question how appropriate it is in light of recent events . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Black Student Alliance</ORGANIZATION> released a statement in which it declared that " this event has only reminded us of the need to bring back a Black publication , for we will not misrepresent ourselves . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>BSA</ORGANIZATION> makes a fair point . 
I do not think the Rosa Parks piece would have been published with stronger black representation in The Cavalier Daily . 
Somebody along the editing chain would be aware that the article is inappropriate . 
If I can extract anything from the publication of the <DATE>April</DATE> Fools ' articles , it is that the paper 's demonstrated lack of sensitivity toward issues facing minority communities is a natural consequence of homogeneity in our staff . 
We lack the minority representation to be able to effectively do what we do . 
We can generalize this idea to other organizations at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
An <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> without a diverse pool of support officers and leaders can not respond to issues facing diverse communities around Grounds as effectively - and I use the term " diverse " to refer to differences beyond just skin color , such as Greek affiliation or socioeconomic status . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University Guide Service</ORGANIZATION> can not reach out to a diversity of tourists as effectively without a diversity of guides . 
During the recruitment period , The Cavalier Daily should also make a more conscious effort to recruit staffers from different parts of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> by reaching out to those who , for example , belong to <ORGANIZATION>BSA</ORGANIZATION> or live in <ORGANIZATION>Brown College</ORGANIZATION> . 
I do not know how well organizations such as <ORGANIZATION>BSA</ORGANIZATION> would respond to outreach efforts given last week 's error . 
Outreach efforts around the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> also tend to be vague and ineffective . 
Perhaps another solution would involve increasing the number of staffers that read each submission by lengthening the editing chain . 
If many different pairs of eyes read a piece , the chance that potentially offensive content passes through decreases . 
What happened last week illustrates exactly why diversity is so important to our groups and institutions . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily</ORGANIZATION> has produced great work in response to events affecting minority communities , but blunders such as the <DATE>April</DATE> Fools ' issue are much more likely to happen if <ORGANIZATION>The Cavalier Daily</ORGANIZATION> does n't seek greater minority representation .
