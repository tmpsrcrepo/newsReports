Colleges all across the country , including the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> , proudly host a branch of the <ORGANIZATION>ROTC</ORGANIZATION> . 
In fact , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's ROTC program ranks in the top <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of all programs in the country , educating and training future leaders in the armed forces as well as in the civilian sector . 
As one of the most prestigious ROTC programs in the country at one of the best universities in the world , the University ROTC program should spearhead the fight for the freedom of their fellow countrymen to rush into battle shoulder-to-shoulder regardless of sexual orientation . 
In <DATE>1993</DATE> , after intense Congressional debate , President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> persuaded <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to pass the notorious " Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell " policy . 
This law allows gays and lesbians to serve in the military as long as they do not proclaim their sexuality , engage in intimacy or attempt to marry someone of the same sex -- a gay person can serve in the military , as long as he or she does nothing to suggest he or she is in fact gay . 
A few weeks ago , the " Call to Duty Tour " came to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to talk about the need to repeal this bizarre and discriminatory legislation . 
Some of the former military officers who composed the panel no longer can serve their country , not because a fellow soldier outed them but because they could no longer hide their identities and outed themselves . 
Most had the courage to come out to some of their friends in the military while they served , citing that it was hard to hide such an integral part of their identities . 
One of the main criticisms of allowing gay people to serve openly in the military is that it will disrupt " unit cohesion . " 
Oddly enough , most of the people on the panel did not experience harassment or cause their unit to collapse . 
Instead , according to <PERSON>Patrick English</PERSON> , a guest on the panel and a former member of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> , his honesty with his fellow servicemen allowed them to become closer friends , more than likely strengthening unit cohesion . 
This sort of legislation implies that American soldiers are backward and insular and can not handle the presence of homosexuality , even though recent Gallup polls show <PERCENT>79 percent</PERCENT> of Americans do not have a problem with the idea of gay people serving in the military . 
Here at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>ROTC</ORGANIZATION> does not allow gay students to openly serve , as consistent with the national policy . 
Lt. Col. <PERSON>Hampton Hite</PERSON> , of the <ORGANIZATION>University Army ROTC</ORGANIZATION> , agrees personally and professionally with this policy . 
He believes it is fundamentally necessary to have " good order and discipline in a unit , " and the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> is not the place for " social experimentation . " 
One would think that ROTC cadets or <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students would have voiced concern or protested this policy at some point , but Lt. Col. <PERSON>Hite</PERSON> claimed he had never heard a complaint or seen a protest in his five years here . 
This begs the question , are <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students apathetic about this issue , do they agree with it or are those directly involved in the ROTC scared to disagree openly ? 
The Call to Duty Tour reports that at least 65,000 gay or bisexual Americans serve today in the <ORGANIZATION>United States Armed Forces</ORGANIZATION> . 
Certainly , the military is not disintegrating or disbanding because of the existence of gay people serving alongside straight people . 
At a time when the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> desperately needs more people to serve in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> , it seems illogical to turn away Americans with the skill and the desire to fight for a country that will not even claim them . 
Because being open about sexual orientation is a personal decision , and one that would terminate a career in the military without question , it is probable that students at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> have not pursued joining the <ORGANIZATION>ROTC</ORGANIZATION> because of this policy . 
If an <ORGANIZATION>ROTC</ORGANIZATION> cadet had the courage to voice a disagreement with the " Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell " policy , certainly he would fear his peers or superiors suspecting him of being gay . 
Thus , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student body must take up the arms of those who literally can not express dissent for fear of losing their position in the military . 
This is the very definition of discrimination , undermining the integrity of an institution that represents the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> around the world . 
Fighting for one 's country is one of the most basic rights of a citizen . 
Before African-Americans even had the right to vote , they served in the military . 
Military philosophy encourages teamwork and group loyalty , and the diverse American army celebrates unity despite individual difference . 
Gay and lesbian people should be able to wear the American uniform openly and with pride , knowing that they serve a country that embraces individual freedom of expression on both sides of the battlefield .
