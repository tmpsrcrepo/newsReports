The hazing of a sorority member -- including dropping a freshman in a coffin so she could be reborn as a <ORGANIZATION>Chi Omega</ORGANIZATION> sister -- and failure to follow nationally established principles led the <ORGANIZATION>Chi Omega</ORGANIZATION> national sorority to suspend the <ORGANIZATION>Sam Houston State University</ORGANIZATION> chapter last week . 
Sam <ORGANIZATION>Houston State University</ORGANIZATION> is located in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> . 
The victim of the hazing , identified by the <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION> Item newspaper as <PERSON>Kristin Leigh Verzwyvelt</PERSON> , alleged that some of her sorority sisters placed her in a coffin and covered her with a sheet to symbolize her rebirth in <LOCATION>Chi Omega</LOCATION> , said <PERSON>David P. Weeks</PERSON> , criminal district attorney in <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION> . 
Verzwyvelt also alleged that in a separate incident on <DATE>Feb. 17</DATE> , some of her sorority sisters slipped drugs in her drink and drove her to a male acquaintance 's apartment and asked him to rape her , according to the <LOCATION>Huntsville</LOCATION> Item . 
Verzwyvelt brought sexual assault charges against the man to local police <DATE>April 10</DATE> . 
However , a grand jury found insufficient evidence to indict the male suspect . 
The victim " admitted to consuming a significant amount of alcohol the night of the alleged rape , " Weeks said . 
This and the fact that " she had a consensual sexual encounter with the same man the following night put a knife in the heart of the case , " he said . 
" Legally , there was no sexual assault , " but school officials plan to continue investigating these allegations , said <PERSON>Frank Krystyniak</PERSON> , public relations director at <ORGANIZATION>Sam Houston State</ORGANIZATION> . 
Sam <ORGANIZATION>Houston State</ORGANIZATION> officials do not have the authority to suspend Chi <ORGANIZATION>Omega</ORGANIZATION> 's charter , but they have revoked the status of the <ORGANIZATION>Chi Omega</ORGANIZATION> house as the headquarters of the sorority . 
The house is located on university property . 
Chi <ORGANIZATION>Omega Executive Headquarters</ORGANIZATION> said that although the chapter is closed , it may return to <ORGANIZATION>Sam Houston State</ORGANIZATION> in the future . 
Although the victim reports being drugged , " I have no evidence of drugs being involved , " <PERSON>Krystyniak</PERSON> said . 
" The only evidence of drugs is in her statement . 
There were no tests done , and thus there is no absolute proof of drugs . " 
Weeks said the victim said she received Ketamine , known by many as " Special K. " This drug is taken intravenously , but Verzwyvelt claims her sorority sisters slipped the drug in her drink . 
The allegations of rape had more to do with alcohol consumption than the ingestion of a drug , Weeks said . 
" You can be intoxicated and taken advantage of . 
My problem [ with the case ] , however , is with the consensual sex encounter the next night , " he said . 
" I have a great deal of sympathy for the victim , " he added . 
" The thing that really concerns me is I do n't want people who are victims of rape to be afraid to come forward " because this case was dismissed . 
Verzwyvelt could not be reached for comment .
