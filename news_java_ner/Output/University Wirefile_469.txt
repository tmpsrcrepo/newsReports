Courtesy <ORGANIZATION>Mark Herring</ORGANIZATION> campaign <ORGANIZATION>Attorney General Mark Herring</ORGANIZATION> will chair the 30-member task force which aims to develop legislative strategies to address the issue of sexual violence on college campuses . 
The Governor 's <ORGANIZATION>Task Force</ORGANIZATION> on Combating Campus Sexual Violence met for the first time <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> to discuss ways to prevent and respond to sexual violence on college campuses . 
Gov. <PERSON>Terry McAuliffe</PERSON> signed an executive order in <DATE>August</DATE> to establish the task force in collaboration with <ORGANIZATION>Attorney General Mark Herring</ORGANIZATION> , who will chair the 30-member group . 
The task force includes campus administrators , advocates , law enforcement , higher education attorneys and health professionals , including Dean of <ORGANIZATION>Students Allen Groves and University</ORGANIZATION> alumna <PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> , a project coordinator in the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Student Affairs</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Of all the worries parents have about their children 's education , the fear of violence , victimization , or injustice after the fact , should not be among them , " Herring said at the meeting . 
Herring 's daughter attends <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I worry , just like every other parent worries , about whether my children are safe , " he said . " 
[ We must ] approach this issue with the urgency and dedication it demands . " 
As colleges work to address sexual violence , <ORGANIZATION>Herring</ORGANIZATION> said , " inaction at the state level can not continue . " 
At the meeting , members were divided into three subcommittees : prevention , response and law enforcement . 
The subcommittees will meet monthly , while the task force will meet quarterly as a group and hear reports back from the subcommittees . 
Groves will serve on the response subcommittee , which aims to ensure reports of sexual violence are met with prompt " survivor-centered " responses , and to recommend best practices regarding appropriate campus disciplinary proceedings . 
" The ultimate goal is to deliver a set of consolidated best practices to the Governor next <DATE>summer</DATE> , so that <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> colleges may then consider implementing them as part of their work to prevent and address sexual violence , " <PERSON>Groves</PERSON> said . 
Renda will chair the prevention subcommittee , which will focus on ways to prevent sexual assault through bystander intervention campaigns and increasing student awareness . " 
[ We ] discussed an emphasis on evidence-based and adaptable practices , so we will start out work with gathering research and conferring with experts at our next gathering , " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said . 
The law enforcement subcommittee will aim to foster strong relationships between local law enforcement , campus police , administration and students . 
" We want ways to ensure an understanding of the university responsibilities and the responsibilities of law enforcement , while maintaining a survivor-centered response , " Herring said . 
" Each one has different , parallel responsibilities and procedures . 
We need to make sure everyone knows how those two tracks work and how they may interact . " 
The next quarterly meeting will take place in <DATE>January</DATE> , and the task force is expected to submit a final report to <ORGANIZATION>McAuliffe</ORGANIZATION> by <DATE>June 1</DATE> . 
Though the task force was created months ago , <PERSON>McAuliffe</PERSON> said the disappearance of second-year <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> has reinforced its mission . 
" For many of us , as the governor said , the issue of campus safety hit too close to home , " <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Secretary of Education <PERSON>Anne Holton</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Holton</PERSON> is one of three secretaries working with task force subcommittees and will lead the prevention group with <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> . 
The task force 's urgency is also underscored by the federal government 's investigation of 76 schools to determine whether their handling of sexual violence reports complies with antidiscrimination laws . 
Four of the schools are in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> - the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>College of William & Mary</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>James Madison University</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>the University of Richmond</ORGANIZATION> . 
" This wo n't be easy , but we do n't have a choice , " Herring said . 
" It 's time to say ' no more ' to sexual violence on our campuses . 
... That 's the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> I know , and that 's the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> we want the world to know . "
