An attempted sexual assault on 17th Street early <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> caused a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student to receive medical treatment from <ORGANIZATION>University Hospital</ORGANIZATION> .

She had been drinking , but she said she was not intoxicated . 
" I was walking home from the game and passing over Beta Bridge " when she was approached by a man with a camera and a bicycle , the student said . 
" He said he wanted to take a picture of me -- I knew it was a farce , but I thought it was harmless . " 
As the student walked along to 17th Street , she said the attacker dropped his bike and asked to take another picture of her . 
But after she did not respond , the attacker chose to use force . 
" He came at me and put his hand over my mouth , " she said . 
" He started to get angry -- he said he had a gun . " 
She added that the attacker attempted to physically assault her in the middle of the street . 
" He took both of his hands and pulled outwards on my cheeks , " the student said . 
" He started to get angry . " 
The student said she made strong attempts to defend herself . 
" I made myself as heavy as possible , " she said . 
" I began kicking like only a mad , mad soccer player could and I finally got his hand off of my face and screamed and screamed and screamed . " 
She said police and ambulances responded after several students took her into a house near the location of the attack ; a male student attempted to chase down the attacker but was unsuccessful . 
The attacked student said while she did not have an exact recollection of the assailant , she described him as about 24-25 years old , about five feet six with short , sandy blonde hair , wearing camouflage clothing . 
The student said <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Police Officer <PERSON>B. N. O'Donnell</PERSON> was working on the case . 
O'Donnell could not be reached for comment . 
But the student said <LOCATION>Charlottesville Police</LOCATION> are investigating whether the incident may be connected with an <DATE>Oct. 15</DATE> rape underneath Beta Bridge . 
" They said it could quite possibly be the same attacker , " she said . 
The student said she hoped she could warn other students about the dangers of sexual assault and specifically emphasized the early time of her attack . 
" I ca n't believe it happened at 6:30 " at night , she said . 
" I think it 's very important to emphasize it was a very common time of day . " 
Dean of Students <PERSON>Robert T. Canevari</PERSON> said he was not aware of the incident . 
He also expressed concern about the lack of communication from <LOCATION>Charlottesville Police</LOCATION> . 
" I 'm happy to hear she was successful in fending the guy off , " <PERSON>Canevari</PERSON> said . 
" But I 'm concerned about the lack of information shared by the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Police . " 
Canevari also warned students about being aware and cautious at any time of day . 
" A lot of these [ potential attackers ] look for times of opportunity , " he said . 
" The streets were probably kind of quiet " because many students were still at the football game .
