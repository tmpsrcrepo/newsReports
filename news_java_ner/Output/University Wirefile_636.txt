On <DATE>Dec. 7 , 2014</DATE> , journalist <PERSON>Charles C. Johnson</PERSON> of Got News released the full name of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student at the center of the Rolling Stone article " A Rape on Campus . " 
Following this , <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> started receiving threats at her home address . 
Jackie 's name was found via the website of the company <ORGANIZATION>University Directories</ORGANIZATION> , an arm of <ORGANIZATION>The AroundCampus Group</ORGANIZATION> that has since gone bankrupt . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has a standing contract with <ORGANIZATION>University Directories</ORGANIZATION> to make its student directory , which , for the first time , it arranged to put online this year . 
Public access to student directory information is allowed under and regulated by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act . 
Elements of <LOCATION>FERPA</LOCATION> allow students to request information that was otherwise not disclosed by universities . 
But , according to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> , under <LOCATION>FERPA</LOCATION> schools may disclose directory information without student or parental consent , so long as individuals are given enough time to request information not be disclosed - effectively an opt-out system . 
This request must come in a written document . 
According to <PERSON>Carol Stanley</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's registrar , " [ <LOCATION>FERPA</LOCATION> ] was passed to allow students to have some authority over their academic information . " 
When the law was passed in <DATE>1974</DATE> , universities were already providing information about students to the public . 
But the importance of <LOCATION>FERPA</LOCATION> is , as <ORGANIZATION>Stanley</ORGANIZATION> said , that it " gives the student ownership and authority over . . . information - there is a huge piece that 's the student 's responsibility . " 
But the major downside of this opt-out system of releasing student directory information is that students may not know their information is out there . 
There is an explanation of students ' rights under <LOCATION>FERPA</LOCATION> on the Registrar 's site , and at the start of a student 's first year , the Registrar sends out an email detailing students ' rights under <LOCATION>FERPA</LOCATION> and the topic is discussed at orientation . 
But <LOCATION>FERPA</LOCATION> has so many layers to it - including academic information , not only directory information - that details can slip through the cracks . 
Moreover , should students find later in their University careers they wish to remove their information , at that point it may be too late . 
This is primarily due to the switch the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is attempting to make from print directories to online-only ones . 
According to <PERSON>Susie McCormick</PERSON> , the assistant vice president for <ORGANIZATION>Information Technology Budget and Administration</ORGANIZATION> , the school is " in a process of trying to eliminate the printed phonebook . " 
This process took a dark turn following the Rolling Stone article , but reveals the problems with privacy flagging directories in general : should a student wish to make her information private years into her <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> career - which she is able to do - the information that was previously made available will still be available . 
With online directories , the chance of such information remaining public is obviously heightened . 
Interestingly , while <LOCATION>FERPA</LOCATION> allows the release of directory information , it by no means requires it . 
According to <PERSON>Laurie Casteen</PERSON> , associate dean of students , " <LOCATION>FERPA</LOCATION> allows [ the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> ] to give out information - it does n't require that you do . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> does n't , for example , tend to release date of birth information , though it does release a number of other identifiers , such as name , home and school address , home and school phone number , email address , country of citizenship and photographic images - to name just a few . 
It is easy to question the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's decision to do this , if administrators do indeed have the ability to decide both what constitutes directory information and what they wish to divulge . 
But questioning <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policy does not do justice to the obvious issues with <LOCATION>FERPA</LOCATION> as it exists now . 
The fact of having an opt-out system - as opposed to an opt-in one - makes it more likely students ' information will be released without their ability to restrict such releases . 
If the release of such information does indeed start with the student 's consent , students should be given the option to allow the release of their information , not the option to prevent its release . 
The downside to restricting the release of directory information is that relevant information may not be accessible . 
For example , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> email addresses of students who request privacy flags become unsearchable . 
Other consequences can be worse . 
According to <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> , " If a student has financial aid or requires other release of their information . . . they would need to fill out additional documentation . " 
This challenge is certainly surmountable , but still an inconvenience to students receiving financial aid . 
Perhaps the answer to these issues lies in creating more nuance in <LOCATION>FERPA</LOCATION> : for starters , preventing the public from accessing directory information should not necessarily prevent the distribution of directory information within an institution of higher learning . 
While financial aid information may be more difficult to address , the possibility of allowing students to specify what information they would like private may enable schools to release financial aid information and not information like students ' photographs or other questionable materials . 
In the meantime , the school has taken down the directory once on <ORGANIZATION>University Directories</ORGANIZATION> ' site , and , according to <PERSON>McCormick</PERSON> , does not intend to restore it in the near future - instead taking this next year to organize a better way to make an online directory available . 
But we should not leave this conversation at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> level : <LOCATION>FERPA</LOCATION> itself is a flawed law . 
Between <DATE>1974</DATE> and <DATE>2015</DATE> , with the rise of the Internet , the accessibility of information has changed . 
With it , so should students ' ability to curb the release of their information .
