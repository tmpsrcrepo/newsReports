Monica Long 's untimely death may direct attention to the often-ignored presence of domestic violence at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> . 
Domestic violence is a more pervasive concern than many students realize , according to <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , a sexual assault coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Women 's Center</ORGANIZATION> . 
" There seems to be a high level of denial among undergraduates that this is a problem , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
" Many people perceive it as a problem of a certain class , but domestic violence affects people at all levels of society . " 
Twenty-eight percent of couples experience violence , including both married and dating relationships , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
Dean of <ORGANIZATION>Students Penny Rue</ORGANIZATION> also said she suspected domestic violence is " more widespread than we think . " 
Rue said it is " one of those things that we think ca n't happen to us , that only happens to someone else . " 
Long 's death is " a tragedy that is unprecedented in my career , " Rue added . 
According to <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> , there often are warning signs aside from overt violence -- such as verbal insults and emotional blackmail -- indicating a relationship may be unsafe . 
However , " if people are uninformed about the dynamics of abuse , they may not realize how much danger they 're actually in , " she said . 
<PERSON>Lara Eilhardt</PERSON> , co-president of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION>National Organization of Women</ORGANIZATION> , said it is nearly impossible to determine how many <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students face domestic violence because the majority of cases go unreported . 
" Many women are inherently inattentive to the issue in their own lives , " <PERSON>Eilhardt</PERSON> said , often because women do n't expect domestic violence to affect the college-aged population . 
However , " it only takes one time for something bad to happen . " 
Both <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eilhardt</PERSON> urged individuals who find themselves in an emotionally or physically abusive relationship to utilize <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> resources in seeking help . 
The Women 's Center offers counseling and emergency aid to students , as well as educational information about domestic violence . 
Students interested in counseling may contact the Center at 982-2361 for more information . 
Individuals who find themselves in urgent situations may also contact the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Sexual Assault Resource Agency</ORGANIZATION> at 295-7273 , 24 hours a day .
