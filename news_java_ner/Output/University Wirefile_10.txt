Legislation now pending in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> could mean that students across the nation have a more accurate perspective on hate crimes at the nation 's college campuses . 
If , in upcoming weeks , <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> officials pass The Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act , colleges would be forced to more fully report hate crime statistics -- a change that could give students a clearer picture of their university 's environment . 
Sen. <PERSON>Robert Torricelli</PERSON> ( D-N.J. ) first proposed the original legislation in <DATE>November</DATE> . 
Specifically , the bill require colleges to release additional information on hate crimes , including vandalism , intimidation and simple assault . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police Captain Michael Coleman</ORGANIZATION> said the bill will make students more aware of hate crimes . 
But he said many of the proposed changes already have been followed by the <ORGANIZATION>University Police Department</ORGANIZATION> for years , including publication of larceny offenses . 
" We 've already had a pretty strong reporting program in effect , " <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said . 
The bill " will have very little effect on what we 're doing . " 
Even so , <PERSON>Torricelli</PERSON> spokesman <PERSON>Jon Paone</PERSON> said these new measures will help the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> because they will help prospective college students make educated choices when selecting a university . 
Universities now are required only to report hate crimes resulting in serious felonies like rape , murder or aggravated assault , as dictated by the <DATE>1990</DATE> Campus Security Act . 
The bill will enable " incoming students and existing students to have a clearer picture of the existence and the extent to which hate crimes exist on campus , " <PERSON>Paone</PERSON> said . 
" Going in , these students should know exactly what they 're getting into . " 
The bill also proposes to expand the definition of hate crimes to include acts directed against female and/or disabled citizens . 
Colleges also must report hate crimes motivated by race , religion , sexual orientation or ethnicity , but not instances of crime directed against a victim because of gender or personal disability . 
An expanded hate crime definition would be key on college campuses , as younger people are more likely to commit hate crimes , especially those now not publicized , <PERSON>Paone</PERSON> said . 
Here at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , officials said students would inevitably benifit from the change because of the disclosure of additional information . 
Dean of Students <PERSON>Robert T. Canevari</PERSON> said he believes increased publication of crime information might help to broaden public awareness of crime . 
" I think all of us sometimes are a little bit oblivious to crime unless it happens in our backyard , " <PERSON>Canevari</PERSON> said . 
" The more people are aware of crime , the better off for everybody . " 
Third-year College student <PERSON>Jessie Gilliam</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>National Organization for Women University</ORGANIZATION> chapter president , said she would encourage increased reporting of hate crimes . 
" I think there are a lot of small hate crimes that happen at this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Gilliam</PERSON> said . 
" I think things like this are a big deal ... because in a lot of situations , silence indicates acceptance . " 
In terms of the impact on other universities , <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said students at other colleges will benefit the most because officials will be forced to follow policies the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> already adheres to . 
Specifically , <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said the new five-year record stipulation -- which would require police officials to publically release information about crimes committed in the past five years -- could create mountains of back-tracking and paperwork for departments not now calculating these statistics . 
This is especially true if the proposal includes the new hate crime definition .
