SHE CALLS him " treadmill hottie . " 
Every <DATE>Monday</DATE> , <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> and <DATE>Friday</DATE> at <TIME>3:30</TIME> , my apartment-mate does the Stairmaster at the Aquatic and <ORGANIZATION>Fitness Center</ORGANIZATION> , while he runs on the treadmill . 
They 've never spoken , but one day , she thinks , she 'll smile and say , " It looks like we 're on the same wavelength . " 
But in fact , she and her hottie are n't the only students at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> who make a workout part of their weekly routine . 
At <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , exercise is as popular a pastime as partying on Rugby -- and brimming with just as much peer pressure . 
Much like the body-obsessed American culture , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> culture tends to place great emphasis on physical fitness and appearance . 
And while routine exercise is necessary for good health , it is important that we make the distinction between healthy and unhealthy workouts , and emphasize the role of mental health in students ' well being . 
Last <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> , <ORGANIZATION>UVA Cares</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's task force on eating disorders , presented a play by Act Out-a Philadelphia-based acting company - entitled " Body Loathing , Body Love . " 
The original script , written by a young woman with a history of eating disorders , examined the signs and symptoms of these illnesses and their causes , and debunked a number of common myths . 
One such myth is that eating disorders are found mostly in adolescent girls . 
But the <ORGANIZATION>American Anorexia and Bulimia Association</ORGANIZATION> estimates that 5 to <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of college women suffer from an eating disorder , which often results from both low self-esteem and an overwhelming amount of external stresses . 
The disorder often provides the victim with a way to control a part of her life when she feels she has no control over other areas . 
Disorders are more common in college women , the <ORGANIZATION>George Mason University Counseling and Student Development Center</ORGANIZATION> reports , because -- besides facing a great deal of academic and social stress -- college women traditionally have " abnormally low self-esteem . " 
Furthermore , eating disorders often are a means of coping with other traumas , most notably sexual assault , which tends to prevail on college campuses . 
Among college women , bulimia is the more common disorder . 
While most people identify a bulimic as someone who binges and then purges by vomiting , many bulimics purge through compulsive exercise . 
University students , in particular , should be aware of the symptoms of compulsive exercise . 
Certainly , regular workouts are mandatory for staying healthy . 
But if you feel guilty or depressed when you miss a workout , place exercise ahead of work , social life or family , or modify your exercise habits based on your weight or your eating habits , you may be exercising too much . 
The <ORGANIZATION>American College of Sports Medicine</ORGANIZATION> maintains the average individual , i.e. a non-athlete , should exercise three to five days a week , for 15 to 60 minutes at a moderate intensity . 
Anything more could constitute compulsive behavior . 
Fortunately , when it comes to treatment for eating disorders , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> is well equipped . 
<ORGANIZATION>Student Health Counseling and Psychological Services</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Ainsworth Clinic</ORGANIZATION> and the Women 's Center , are just a few of the on-Grounds resources available to students with eating disorders . 
Among them , a student can receive assessments , referrals , individual and group therapy and workshops to help them combat the problem . 
What the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> could consider , however , is more programming -- along the lines of " Body Loathing , Body Love " -- designed to prevent eating disorders by changing the body-obsessed culture that prevails on Grounds . 
At <ORGANIZATION>the University of Rochester</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE> , health officials launched a month-long effort to raise awareness about health and self-esteem entitled " Feel Fabulous in <DATE>February</DATE> . " 
Among the month 's activities were a 5K run , a series of lectures and workshops about eating disorders and physical fitness , free screenings for eating disorders and <MONEY>$ 5</MONEY> cholesterol screenings . 
In an effort to highlight body image problems , one day was designated the " Day Without Mirrors , " and mirrors all over campus were covered with inspirational fliers imploring students and professors : " True beauty ... find it for yourself . " 
In a culture where we are exposed daily to photographs of fashion models who weigh <PERCENT>23 percent</PERCENT> less than the average woman and store mannequins who , if human , would be too thin to menstruate , that kind of effort is tremendously refreshing . 
And there should be much more of it . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should expand its health programming to include efforts such as these , which promote , above all else , a healthy self-image among students . 
Students should also realize the power they themselves possess to help their peers maintain a positive self-confidence . 
Examine your own self-image and how others contribute to it . 
Then try to assess the ways in which you can contribute to the self-esteem of your peers . 
Look out for friends who show symptoms of eating disorders and try to determine what might be causing them . 
Remind them that beauty is internal , and try not to roll your eyes when you say it . 
They just might believe you . 
And you just might believe yourself .
