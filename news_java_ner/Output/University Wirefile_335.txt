CANNIBALISM . 
It 's a joke -- something that our " developed " civilization didaway with , something that appears only in horror movies or tales of barbaric civilizations lurking in jungles . 
While society has proven sympathetic to " survival cannibalism " ( the Dominican castaways who ate their dead peers to survive in <DATE>2001</DATE> ) , the ritualistic intake of human flesh for pleasure has , for a long time , remained taboo . 
" Consensual cannibalism , " however , is the phrase of the new millennium . 
It is the ultimate sexual fetish -- one made possible by our legal system . 
Unreal though it may sound , cannibalism is legal . 
In both <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and most of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , the act of eating human flesh is not illegal . 
What kind of barbaric society are we that our own laws wo n't protect us from consumption ? 
While most of us assume that cannibalism is as illegal as murder or rape ; the infamous <DATE>2001</DATE> case of Mr. <PERSON>Meiwes</PERSON> , a German who placed an internet ad looking for someone wishing to be killed and eaten , proved otherwise . 
Meiwes 's ad , " Looking for a well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter , " received over 200 replies from people offering themselves up for consumption . 
<PERSON>Bernd-Jurgen Brandes</PERSON> , <PERSON>Meiwes</PERSON> 's pick , had his penis cut off and cooked . 
The victim was then cut into pieces . 
The whole incident was filmed on videotape , which apparently shows that not only was the act consensual , it was done purely for sexual enjoyment . 
Mr. <PERSON>Meiwes</PERSON> , however , was not charged with cannibalism , but with murder for sexual satisfaction , according to <ORGANIZATION>BBC News</ORGANIZATION> . 
This means , then , that had <PERSON>Meiwes</PERSON> not actually killed the man , but simply eaten his body , he would not have gone to jail . 
Although this might seem like enough to adjust the law , no government has done so . 
British Home Office Minister <PERSON>Alun Michael</PERSON> , for example , said in a <ORGANIZATION>House of Commons</ORGANIZATION> written reply that the government had no intention of making cannibalism a specific criminal offence . 
This is n't a specifically European problem . 
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has had its fair share of cannibalistic stories in the past few years . 
In <DATE>2004</DATE> , the band Hell On Earth decided to offer consensual cannibalism as part of their <DATE>March 6</DATE> performance in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> . 
Wanting to let the audience participate in the event , they held an online contest to let one of their fans play " ' food critic for a day ' by tasting the human meat during [ their ] show followed by his or her commentary to the audience regarding how it tastes . " 
While their Web site at first seems like a joke , the cannibalistic video clips it offers are real enough . 
The band did not suffer any consequences for its cannibalism , and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , much like <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> , did not seem to think the event worthy enough to merit changing the law . 
While a German man with a sexual fetish and a controversial <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> heavy metal band might be chalked up as crazy , they are not the only ones taking advantage of the lack of laws . 
Even " normal " people have ventured into the field of cannibalism . 
In the late <DATE>1900</DATE> 's , <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON>William Seabrook</PERSON> obtained a chunk of human meat from the body of a healthy human killed by accident , cooked and ate it . 
In his book , Jungle Ways , he wrote , " It was so nearly like good , fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary , normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal .... I was glad I had tried it in the simpler ways . " 
Because <PERSON>Seabrook</PERSON> did not kill the victim/meal and cannibalism is not illegal , he avoided prosecution . 
While this is clearly indicative of the denigration of our society , many people see it as open-mindedness , comparing the consumption of human flesh with that of cows and pigs . 
There are even those who claim that when Jesus Christ proclaimed " He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me , and I in him , " he was speaking in favor of cannibalism . 
For whatever reason , cannibalism is spreading worldwide , with cannibal clubs opening in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> , and chat rooms catering to these individuals ( like the one used by <PERSON>Meiwes</PERSON> , for example ) popping up everywhere . 
No governments seem to care . 
Humans are seen as the top of the food chain , but what happens if we start turning on each other for food ? 
Cannibalism is as much of a crime as murder or rape , for essentially it is abuse of the human body . 
A law might not have been necessary before , but the recent number of cannibalistic acts is a clear sign that one is needed . 
How many cases will it take before our governments open their eyes to the horror they 're permitting ?
