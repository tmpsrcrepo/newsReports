<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily View full gallery from <DATE>Saturday</DATE> 's protest . 
Holding signs and chanting , hundreds of faculty members , graduate instructors , staff and students gathered at Beta Bridge for the " Take Back the Party : End Rape Now ! " 
rally <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> . 
Rally members marched down Rugby Road to the Corner and back before ending the event outside the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity house . 
The rally is part of a series of responses by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community to the Rolling Stone article published <DATE>last week</DATE> alleging a brutal gang rape at a <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity party in <DATE>Sept. 2012</DATE> . 
A press release by rally organizers said it was held in response to ongoing problems of sexual violence at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We 're here because we think there 's an ongoing problem with social life at U.Va. , " said English Prof. <PERSON>Susan Fraiman</PERSON> , one of the main organizers of the rally . 
" It is centered on fraternities and as a result , men control who enters parties and women are not on their own turf . " 
The event was intended to protest a culture that puts female students at risk , according to a press release . 
" We are not here to shut down the party , " the press release said . 
" We are here to support a SAFE social environment for women as well as men . 
This is a FACULTY action demanding an end to sexual assault at U.Va . " 
Professors from a number of departments attended and were instructed to bring signs , wear academic regalia and bring drums , noisemakers , lights and other props . 
" I 've taught here a long time , " <PERSON>Fraiman</PERSON> said . 
" This is the first time , on a cold <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> after a football game , I 've been here on <ORGANIZATION>Rugby Road</ORGANIZATION> . 
Usually in terms of speaking with our students and being concerned with their lives , we stick to intellectual conversation in the classroom . 
But this is something of enormous importance , so we wanted to be out here on the street . 
We wanted to make a statement as faculty , to say that sexual violence against women will not be tolerated . " 
In addition to marching down Rugby Road , rallyists painted both sides of Beta Bridge with the words " Take Back the Party : End Rape ! " 
As they marched , attendees shouted a series of chants , including : " What do we want ? 
An end to rape ! 
When do we want it ? 
Now ! " 
and " Hey Hey , ho ho Sexual assault Has got to go ! 
Hey Hey , ho ho Yes means yes , No means no ! " 
At the end of the rally attendees gathered in front of the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> house and listened to a series of professors , students and survivors share personal anecdotes and demand change at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Spanish Prof. <PERSON>Ricardo Padr</PERSON> Ã ³ n , an '89 College graduate and former chair of the <ORGANIZATION>Faculty Senate</ORGANIZATION> , said the rally was organized to demonstrate to administrators that the issues brought up in the Rolling Stone article are important to the entire <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
" I think it 's very important for faculty and instructors to stand up and support students who have been victims and could be victims , " Padr Ã ³ n said . 
" And [ to ] call upon the administration to make real change that will have a real impact on student culture , so that this sort of thing does n't happen anymore . " 
Many professors expressed disappointment that though rape and sexual violence have been prevalent on Grounds for many years , no collective action has been taken so far . 
" It 's shocking , " English Prof. and Poet <PERSON>Laureate Rita Dove</PERSON> said . 
" It 's shocking that nothing has been done . 
It 's shocking that it took an article by the <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> in order to get this started . 
I think many faculty members are strongly shocked at the level to which the administration has kept this quiet . " 
English Assoc. Prof. <PERSON>Victoria Olwell</PERSON> , another organizer of the rally and an '89 College graduate , said the culture prevalent on Grounds today is similar to the one she experienced as an undergraduate student at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I see a great deal of continuity between the hostile , sexual environment I experienced as an undergraduate and what I see today , " she said . 
" And what I see is that this is not going to change by itself , that we 're going to have to work to change rape culture at U.Va . " 
English Prof. <PERSON>Herbert Tucker</PERSON> said change , though necessary , was likely to be slow . 
" Rape culture is the kind of culture that flourishes in the dark , " <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON> said . 
" Its eradication will be slow , hard , long term work . 
What U.Va . 
can do is keep the issue alive for debate and discussion . 
Creating a culture of discussion where we 're not afraid to talk about these things is probably the most important thing a place like an university could do . " 
American Studies Prof. <PERSON>Lisa Goff</PERSON> said the support of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administration was necessary for any change to be effective . 
" The status quo is not sufficient and has to change [ along with ] the culture in which a young woman is ostracized for reporting sexual abuse , " <PERSON>Goff</PERSON> said . 
" Professors want to support students . 
But the administration , the faculty and the institution of <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> has to support that , or change can not happen . " 
Fraiman , <PERSON>Olwell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON> all called upon action from <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> and other levels of administration . " 
[ The highest levels of administration ] have to avoid the appearance of trying to circle the wagons , " <PERSON>Olwell</PERSON> said . 
" They have to avoid the appearance of trying to save their reputation . 
And they have to take actions that are bold and that are risky to this university 's reputation as a place immune to scandal , in order to effect change in decisive and long-standing ways . " 
A resolution was sent by <ORGANIZATION>English Department Chair Cynthia Wall</ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> , Provost <PERSON>John Simon</PERSON> , College Dean <PERSON>Ian Baucom</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> members <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> . 
Approved unanimously by the English Department faculty , the resolution cited " indignation at the Rector 's appointment , as independent counsel , of an attorney patently exposed to charges of conflict-of-interest . " 
" We therefore have resolved , at a faculty meeting today , to censure as inadequate the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's public pronouncements in the matter , " the resolution read . 
" That the appointment was swiftly rescinded does not remove our concern that failure openly to address criminal patterns of sexual abuse at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will obscure a set of issues that stand in immediate need of forthright discussion among the faculty and across the community . " 
By the time the letter was sent , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> had suspended all fraternal organizations and associated social activities until <DATE>Jan. 9</DATE> . " 
[ Banning of fraternal organizations ] was the kind of response a lot of us were looking for right off the bat , " <PERSON>Tucker</PERSON> said . 
" Will it put a stop to rape ? 
No . 
[ But ] discountenance with the sponsoring of activities of fraternities that seem to have harbored and sheltered the grossest kinds of violence - that 's a good thing . " 
<PERSON>Fraiman</PERSON> said the Rolling Stone article was ultimately for the benefit of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , allowing community members to advance a dialogue about how to combat rape culture . 
" I would love to see [ <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> ] become a model , " she said . 
" I know that some students worry that this kind of publicity makes U.Va . 
look bad . 
In fact , we have the opportunity to look good if we respond in the right way to this . 
We can really be in the forefront of addressing this problem . " 
Fifth-year <PERSON>Batten</PERSON> student <PERSON>Carl David Goette-Luciak</PERSON> , who attended the rally , said the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administration 's first step was to realize its policies and procedures have failed . 
" Go back to the drawing board and listen to all of these student voices that are pouring out right now , with thoughts , concerns , demands and issues , " <PERSON>Goette-Luciak</PERSON> said . 
" The most important thing for President <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> right now is to listen to the outpouring of voices from students . "
