With discussion of whether <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> 's contract will be renewed and the plethora of issues that have received national attention this year , many at U.Va . 
have voiced disapproval of or support for <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> as our president . 
But this focus on <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> , while important , has overshadowed the importance and relevance of other administrators - administrators who directly impact issues like sexual assault , race relations and other problems facing our student body . 
Earlier this month , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> alumna <PERSON>Jenny Wilkinson</PERSON> penned an op-ed for The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> on her experience filing a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>late 1990s</DATE> . 
At her <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> hearing , <PERSON>Wilkinson</PERSON> 's case came before " a five-person panel of faculty , university staff members and current students . " 
One has to wonder - how many of those faculty and staff members are still at our <ORGANIZATION>University ?</ORGANIZATION> 
And what has their role been in facilitating needed change in our sexual misconduct policy ? 
<PERSON>Patricia Lampkin</PERSON> , vice president and chief student affairs officer , started her job in <DATE>2002</DATE> ; prior to that , she served as interim vice president for 15 months , and prior to that she served as associate vice president for student affairs for six years . 
Her work for <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> dates back to <DATE>1979</DATE> . 
Dean of Students <PERSON>Allen Groves</PERSON> started his position in <DATE>2007</DATE> , and though he came into this position after spending 16 years as a lawyer , prior to that in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> he worked as area coordinator for 11 first-year dorms under <PERSON>Lampkin</PERSON> , who was then the associate dean of students . 
<PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> , associate dean of students and chair of the <ORGANIZATION>SMB</ORGANIZATION> , has been involved with the board since <DATE>2004</DATE> and became chair in <DATE>2006</DATE> . 
Deans in other areas have been in their positions for similar amounts of time , with deans in the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Diversity and Equity</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>the Office of African-American Affairs</ORGANIZATION> dating back to the early <DATE>2000s</DATE> , and dating back in other positions at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> as far as the <DATE>1980s</DATE> . 
This is not to comment on the work of the administrators mentioned above . 
But the intense scrutiny of <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> - who has only been at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>2010</DATE> - begs an important question : where is that same scrutiny of other administrators who have been here much longer and whose impact is , in many ways , much more significant to the lives of students ? 
Certainly , the question of <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> 's contract renewal is incredibly significant and will have an impact on students ' lives . 
But , since the president of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> is , in many ways , beholden to the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> , and since that role is much more geared toward fundraising , those whose work actually affects students are at other rungs of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> 's administration . 
How the vice president and chief student affairs officer interacts with student groups - and with the administrators below her - has a much more obvious impact . 
And if we have seen over time that <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policies have not significantly improved , we should look to those who propose policy changes and inform the president 's decisions - not just the president herself . 
Scrutiny is merited at all levels of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> bureaucracy , and it would be a disservice to the work of others to focus all of our frustration or praise on one specific administrator .
