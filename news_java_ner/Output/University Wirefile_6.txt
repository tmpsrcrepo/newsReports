The term " role model " is tossed around quite a bit in sports today . 
And all too often the story uses it to describe what the athlete is not , whether it consists of the baseball star accused of rape , the football player caught for drunk driving or the basketball phenom that cheated on an exam . 
Occasionally , though , some shoulder-padded hero comes along to show that the term " athletic role model " still exists ; that the stage athletes are thrust upon does not simply show a one-act play filled with drug busts and gun charges ; that an athlete , if only every once in a while , really can make a difference . 
Few other athletes better fill this role than <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> wide receiver <PERSON>Corey Thomas</PERSON> . 
The Blue Devils ' star 's off-the-field accomplishments and attitudes make even his record-setting gridiron success look insignificant . 
" I 've done a lot of speaking in churches and schools , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said . 
" I love to give a lot back to the community , since God has given so much to me . " 
Thomas also uses his status as a premiere athlete to speak with children in hospitals and recently served as a counselor in a local <LOCATION>Durham</LOCATION> YMCA <DATE>summer</DATE> camp program . 
" There were 12 individual black kids from underprivileged families that did n't have fathers , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said about the program . 
" We were like big brothers , trying to provide role models . " 
As part of the program , <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> and a Duke professor taught the kids about the Civil Rights movement , taking them across the South to see the historical locations first-hand . 
" We 're trying to show that there is hope in the black community , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said . 
" And that the future looks bright . 
" I still get phone calls from [ the kids at the camp ] now telling me how they are doing , " he said . 
" I 'd like to do it again this <DATE>summer</DATE> . 
It was not a lot of money or anything , but it was such a great experience . " 
Given his beliefs , it is not surprising <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> chose his college based on more than just the number of recent bowl appearances , selecting the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Devils</ORGANIZATION> from a group as diverse as <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I 'm the first one in my family to get the chance to go to school , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said . 
" I thought about going to an <ORGANIZATION>Ivy League</ORGANIZATION> school , but then I worried I would n't get a lot of [ football ] exposure there . 
So I figured why not go to an <ORGANIZATION>Ivy League</ORGANIZATION> [ caliber ] school in the ACC that gets a lot of national attention . 
" I could have busted my knee in the first game and never gotten the chance to play football again , " he said . 
" But the one thing football ca n't take away from you is your mind . " 
Thomas , who calls the upcoming matchup with <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Duke</ORGANIZATION> 's " toughest game of the season , " scorched the Cavalier defense and former All-ACC cornerback <PERSON>Ronde Barber</PERSON> for 13 catches for 132 yards and a pair of touchdowns -- all career highs -- during his last trip to <LOCATION>Scott Stadium</LOCATION> . 
Thomas enters <DATE>Saturday</DATE> 's contest as one of the most veteran players in Division I football . 
After a red-shirt season , the fifth-year senior has started every game he has been at Duke -- beginning with his impressive debut against <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> in <DATE>1994</DATE> . 
" My first catch was a touchdown , and that really gave me confidence , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said . 
" And if you give me confidence , I can kill you . 
After that , the transition [ to college play ] was really easy for me . " 
Thomas , who currently stands among the top seven in the Duke receiving annals for career catches , yardage and touchdowns , said all his experience has made him a better football player . 
" Nobody can show me anything I have n't seen , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said . 
" They ca n't shock me . 
I 've played against a lot of great players , a lot of players that are now in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> . " 
While <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> always has been a consistent performer , his long career has allowed him to fall along the full spectrum of team success . 
Thomas described the change as " like night and day " between the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Devils</ORGANIZATION> ' Hall of Fame Bowl team his first year and last years ' 0-11 squad . 
" I think you can learn a lot about a person 's character by how they respond to adversity around them , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said . 
Last year " was a really tough season , but I came through smiling the same way I did in <DATE>1994</DATE> . " 
Thomas ' already gaudy receiving numbers become even more impressive in light of the fact that since his first season the <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> , <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION> , native has not had the luxury of establishing any degree of rapport with a quarterback . 
Thomas has teamed up with an incredible seven <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> signal callers and has caught touchdown passes from five . 
In typical fashion , <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> managed to find a bright side of the Durham-based quarterbacking carousel . 
" I 've got used to seeing different quarterbacks , different ways of throwing the ball , " he said . 
" And it has helped me develop as a receiver and will be useful if I do go to the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> where I might have to deal with a lot of different quarterbacks . " 
While <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> ' gridiron success and athletic ability lead many draft gurus to believe he will be playing on <DATE>Sundays</DATE> next year , the aspiring teacher said professional football is only one option for his future . 
" If I get a shot [ in the NFL ] , that would be great , but if things do n't work out , the world 's not going to come to an end , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said . 
" I 'll get the chance to do some teaching and give back to the community . "
