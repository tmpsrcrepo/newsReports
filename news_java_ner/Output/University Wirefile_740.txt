A commonly expressed sentiment among <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students in recent weeks has been to lament the fourth years , whose last year at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> was marred by tragedy after tragedy . 
While it is true that this year 's graduating class is leaving the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> at a difficult time , the Class of <DATE>2015</DATE> has the unique opportunity to carry the heat of the events of the school year into the outside world . 
When I first arrived on Grounds , I heard talk of the U.Va . 
bubble , which keeps students from contextualizing their experiences at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> on any large scale . 
Soon thereafter , I found myself within the bubble 's embrace . 
All throughout my first year , it seemed like the world turned around <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> . 
While last year I could go days or even weeks without reading the news , this year , the news came to us . 
Those of us in the classes of <DATE>2016</DATE> , <DATE>2017</DATE> and <DATE>2018</DATE> have the responsibility to move forward in this community . 
While we must remember the events of this year , the U.Va . 
bubble will likely form around us again . 
Certainly , we could not have predicted the events of this year as we moved into our homes in <DATE>August</DATE> . 
We can not look forward knowing we will not be hit with another tragedy . 
However , with this potential return to normalcy , we risk leaving this year in the past as a troublesome memory . 
The Class of <DATE>2015</DATE> , however , will not have the opportunity to see even the short-term impacts of this year - at least not as students . 
They will not have the opportunity to forget this school year , as it is their final memory of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Rather , they are entering the outside world having experienced large-scale national issues in their own backyard . 
While I hope the Class of <DATE>2015</DATE> has plenty of fond memories of their time in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , I also hope they will recognize their unique ability to take what has happened this year as more than just a series of tragedies , and continue to think about the issues at hand even after they have left the immediacy of their impact . 
While many <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students take on active roles tackling social justice issues while at school , we are only here for four years . 
For there to be real healing and growth in this community , there has to be healing and growth beyond its borders and throughout the country . 
This has been true throughout the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's history , and will continue to be true . 
We can not solve the issue of campus rape alone , but seeing how it affects our community should inspire recent graduates to engage the outside world with these issues . 
Although it may sound clich Ã © , once we leave Grounds we are ambassadors of this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
For the rest of our lives , people will ask us where we studied as an undergraduate . 
Being at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> in the 2014-15 school year is an experience that can not be replicated or even put into words . 
Even now , students struggle to put into words exactly how they feel about this school year . 
I would never want to attempt to tie the events of this year into a neat package and highlight a single lesson that we have learned . 
Experiences have been varied and ranging in scale . 
Doing so would be unfair to the lives lost and the students affected by each of these issues . 
In many ways we remain frustrated and confused as a community . 
As ambassadors of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> going forward , the Class of <DATE>2015</DATE> will be faced with some difficult questions . 
It is my hope they will respond with empathy , compassion , and hope for our community in a way that inspires them to do work which ensures long-term growth and healing for and outside <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> .
