SEXUAL assault has been a source of heated debate and grave concern within the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
However , one twisted form of this phenomenon has been so institutionalized that it has gone largely unnoticed despite its obvious assault on the very foundations of morality . 
" Dating auctions " which are carried out by various cultural groups at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> need to be reevaluated and condemned for their devastating impacts on self-esteem . 
First , it is essential to look at the process of a date auction . 
In essence , a bunch of good-looking men and women are selected from various cultural organizations and placed on stage . 
People are invited to then bid on these selected individuals in auction-style , and the highest bidder often gets to go on a date or a Spring Formal dance with his or her newly acquired bride or groom ( not unlike selling your body in prostitution ) . 
And to legitimize all this -- proceeds either go to charities or some other benevolent cause . 
However , this activity is immoral , as it treats individuals as priced items or material goods for sale , parading and flaunting their " stuff " on stage for bids . 
It equates them with commercial items that are auctioned like paintings and old artifacts . 
No matter how noble a cause is , nothing justifies the treatment of human beings as objects for financial means , whether they volunteer for it or are asked to because they look good or the organization has a limited membership . 
It encourages disrespect for peers among students and is fundamentally degrading to the talented men and women we have at this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The immoral nature of this activity definitely reflects a much needed reevaluation of its existence at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
In addition , one must wonder what the direct social implications of this activity might be for individuals participating in these auctions . 
Most obviously , participants could incur adamage to their self-esteem if they receive a low bid relative to those standing to their left or right . 
In an interview , <PERSON>Larry Carter</PERSON> , assistant director of <ORGANIZATION>Student Health 's Counseling and Psychological Department</ORGANIZATION> , agreed that " People who are more introverted with lower self esteems may find the process unpleasant . " 
Some individuals who have participated in such auctions also feel that they are an assault on the moral fabric of society . 
" Placing yourself as merchandize and putting a price on other people , even for charity , hurts individuals no matter what . 
It 's awkward , humiliating , and not modern , " says <PERSON>Yumi Hara</PERSON> , who participated in a date auction for the Japanese Club last year . 
Yumi claims she knows other individuals who have felt humiliated in some way by these auctions from other cultural associations as well . 
Perhaps the most disturbing facet of these auctions is the fact that they are being left relatively unchallenged and unknown at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
For instance , three of four experts I contacted from the <ORGANIZATION>Social Norms Institute</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>the Office of Health Promotion</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>the Counseling and Psychological Services</ORGANIZATION> were unwilling to comment on the issue because they were " unfamiliar with the program . " 
Hopefully this column begins a process of informed dialogue about the immorality of this activity and its disastrous impacts on society in general and <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> in particular . 
Members of cultural organizations I have spoken to often dismiss the moral and psychological implications of these auctions and choose to emphasize that it is above all a " fun activity . " 
While one would hate to make the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> a dull place , it is critical to consider the implications of activities we are engaged in beyond the degree of pleasure they may offer . 
Plenty of other amoral , psychologically damaging activities are fun as well , and pleasure should not be an impediment in questioning the broader impact of these auctions on student well being and the overall moral fabric of this prestigious university . 
Others prefer to cloak this immoral act by pointing to its moral purpose in raising funds for charity . 
However , any money raised for a benevolent cause through an immoral act should not even be raised in the first place . 
Does prostitution suddenly become moral when one donates the proceeds to charity ? 
Similarly , is the act of degrading individuals by placing money in accordance with their superficial appearance justified when the funds from these immoral acts are diverted to noble causes ? 
Date auctions should not just remain an institutionalized activity without informed debate on the issue . 
This is critical because how we view both men and women at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> plays into greater issues that have been in the limelight of late , such as sexual assault . 
From this perspective , a grassroots effort to eradicate a prevalent problem at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> may lie in studying and debating a much more obscure and unchallenged one . 
Till then , the culture this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and its organizations promote will be centered on the condescending question -- how much are you worth ?
