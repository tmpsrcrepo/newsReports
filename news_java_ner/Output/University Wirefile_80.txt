The silence of black female rape victims is slowly being broken , author and rape survivor <LOCATION>Charlotte</LOCATION> Pierce-Baker told a solemn crowd in <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia 's Minor Hall Auditorium</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> . 
Pierce-Baker , who wrote " Surviving the Silence : Black Women 's Stories of Rape , " said she continues to grow and learn from her book , which was named one of the Best Books of <DATE>1998</DATE> by both the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Times</ORGANIZATION> and The <LOCATION>Philadelphia Enquirer</LOCATION> . 
Writing allowed her to face her fears , she said . 
" I am a rape survivor and I am a black woman who survived rape , " she added , pointing out that a black woman copes with rape differently than a white woman . 
Prior to her own experience , which occurred in <DATE>1981</DATE> , " rape seemed to belong to white women , " <PERSON>Pierce-Baker</PERSON> said . 
She stressed that black women have several societal myths to battle when dealing with rape . 
They are raised to believe myths that suggest they deserve what has happened to them and that black women are promiscuous by nature , she added . 
The fact that some blacks feel as if their race is a family also poses problems for black rape victims , Pierce-Baker said . 
For this reason black some women do not speak out about their rapes , she said . 
" We feel we are blaming our own for the sin [ of rape and ] the fact of the rape must remain in the family " in order not to perpetuate stereotypes of blacks , she added . 
Sexual assault counselors agreed that there is not enough of a support network for black rape victims . 
" I 'm really glad to see the literature on rape and sexual assault now has the depth and breadth to include blacks , " said Women 's Center Counselor <PERSON>Mark Woodford</PERSON> , who attended the speech <TIME>last night</TIME> . 
About 30 students , faculty and community members attended the talk . 
Event organizers said they had intended for it to be heard by a larger audience , including participants from the <DATE>October</DATE> Camp diversity demonstration , which was rained out . 
" We expected a larger turnout of around 150 people , " Women 's <ORGANIZATION>Center Programming Director Amy Campbell</ORGANIZATION> said . 
But the size of the audience did not make a difference to Pierce-Baker , who said she is rewarded by the women who come up to her and tell her that what she has said has affected them . 
They keep her going , she said . 
" I am alive to make it better for others , " she added . 
" I am still healing and still learning . "
