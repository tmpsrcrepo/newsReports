You go abroad with this false hope , this foolish longing that someone will hit a pause button when your plane takes off and life at school wo n't continue without you . 
That you 'll go back and everything will be just the same as you left it . 
My usual seven-hour car ride from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> was replaced by a much shorter one to the <LOCATION>JFK Airport</LOCATION> . 
How many times had I told my friends that going abroad with no one else from U.Va . 
was the best decision I 'd ever made ? 
The growing pit in my stomach and groups of girls hugging each other in the security line were making me reconsider . 
I did n't speak a word of Italian , but neither did most . 
It was lonely knowing I was the only one fluent in <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> . 
Grounds were a long way away . 
I 've been in <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> for the events surrounding the tragedy of <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> 's disappearance , the Rolling Stone article and the backlash that ensued . 
The discussions , the somber camaraderie , the " this is not right and we need to do something , " the desperation and helplessness . 
" You picked a good semester to be abroad , " one of my friends said . 
And I thought about the candlelight vigil , the protests , all the football games I 've missed . 
" Your school seems like a really messed up place , " said another . 
And I heard the " Good Ol' Song " in my head , the emotional urgency of the panels held to discuss what we can do to combat sexual assault . 
The gilded nostalgia I had for Grounds when I first landed in <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> is now laced with an uneasy detachment , a connection to a place I 'm unsure I fully understand . 
And how could I , really ? 
I 've read all the articles , watched interviews , grilled friends about what it 's been like . 
All the listservs I 've cursed for emailing me everyday became a source of comfort , a way to keep myself in the loop . 
A way to imagine how I could 've been involved back at school . 
I 've kept myself educated , but from afar . 
I 'm unable to be present at school , and my attempt at education feels incomplete . 
It 's the most skewed and emotion-laced FOMO I 've ever felt . 
A girl I 'd only met once or twice before approached me on a class trip a weekend ago . 
She interrogated me , judged me and criticized the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
She had just read the Rolling Stone article . 
I barely knew her name . 
It was a rare occasion , me being at a loss for words . 
I could n't articulate that I would forever stand by my school without sounding insensitive , how much pain and disgust I felt without sounding like I hated the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
I wanted to tell her how desperately U.Va . 
needed change , discussion , reformation , action . 
I 'd never felt so far away from a place I called my home before . 
The knot in my stomach I 'd felt at <LOCATION>JFK</LOCATION> tightened a little . 
Going abroad alone was harder than I thought . 
The six-hour time difference means that most discussions are happening when I 'm fast asleep . 
I found out about the suspension of fraternities from the list of " Trending Topics " on the side of my Facebook newsfeed . 
I was hearing the news as if I were a spectator to my own home . 
I remembered my own first year , and it seemed to mirror my time abroad . 
I knew not one other student on my first day of college and was just a short girl from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> among a sea of 15,000 . 
I found out about which fraternities were having parties through girls I barely knew - girls who were more in the know than I was . 
I had fun at those parties . 
I still do . 
I made some great friends that first semester , friends who stayed up with me until dawn in the library and accompanied me on spontaneous road trips . 
Friends who brought me water during that <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> discussion and sat with me for hours in the dining hall . 
Some of those friends became involved in Greek life - some even in the fraternity mentioned in Rolling Stone . 
It 's hard to reconcile and articulate how much those friends mean to me while still expressing my extreme disgust and anger about what was portrayed in the article . 
Miles and miles away , I feel a little bit like that lonely first year again . 
Yet I drink espresso at breakfast , eat pasta as an appetizer and live out an Art History textbook . 
My Italian has gotten no better , and I think my English has gotten worse . 
I 've laughed and traveled and eaten and drank and have had some of the best few months of my life since being in <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> . 
I would n't trade this experience for the world . 
I feel at home here , I think . 
And I think I 'll feel at home back on Grounds too . 
But I ca n't shake the feeling that returning to school in <DATE>January</DATE> will be like studying abroad in a foreign country all over again .
