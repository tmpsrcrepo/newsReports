The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily Albemarle Sheriff Chip Harding</ORGANIZATION> said he would like to see an expansion of DNA databases and DNA collection procedures . 
" We need people like yourself to call elected officials in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> to advocate , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
" It will save lives , we need you to voice your opinions . 
We 'll save lives at not a whole lot of cost . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Albemarle County Sheriff Chip Harding</ORGANIZATION> is advocating for an expansion of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's DNA databanks , pushing for the state to collect DNA from all individuals convicted of misdemeanors . 
Harding specifically cited a <DATE>2010</DATE> misdemeanor charge against <PERSON>Jesse Matthew</PERSON> - who currently faces abduction charges in the case of second-year College student <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> , who was missing for 35 days before her remains were found by police . 
Harding said if <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> 's DNA had been taken in <DATE>2010</DATE> , he would have been linked to DNA obtained in a <DATE>2005</DATE> sexual assault case in <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> , for which he currently faces three charges including attempted murder and forcible penetration . 
" If convicted of that attack he most likely would have been in a jail cell at the time <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> was walking on the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Downtown Mall , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said in a press release . 
University Law Prof. <PERSON>Brandon Garrett</PERSON> said though he strongly supports the use of DNA testing to free the innocent and to convict the guilty , he is not in favor of expanding the databanks to include misdemeanor convictions . 
In his book " Convicting the Innocent : Where Criminal Prosecutions Go Wrong , " <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> examined the first 250 Innocence Project exonerations . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Innocence Project</ORGANIZATION> , a national litigation organization which aims to exonerate those wrongfully convicted using DNA evidence , has a clinic housed under the <ORGANIZATION>School of Law</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> said in an email that expanding these databanks has diminishing returns , and that since few people with misdemeanor records go on to commit serious crimes , the benefits of expansion are unclear . 
" There is the financial and institutional cost of a vast expansion , which could result in backlogs in testing the far more important evidence from actual crime scenes , " <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> said . 
" Innocent people have been convicted due to backlogs at crime labs , or errors at overburdened crime labs . " 
Virginia DNA Section Chief <PERSON>Brad Jenkins</PERSON> said in a press release there is no current backlog in processing profiles and DNA from violent crimes . 
Harding said that because there is not backlog , and that if the plan is implemented at the state rather than national level , the issue presents less of a concern . 
" When it comes to <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , his [ <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> 's ] argument is mute because we do n't have a backlog at the moment , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
" With the correct funding , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> can keep no backlog . " 
<PERSON>Jenkins</PERSON> reported that there are currently 7,700 DNA profiles in the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> DNA Databank which are unidentified . 
Harding said he believes that many of these could be identified if samples were taken for misdemeanors as well as serious crimes . 
Harding , in an <DATE>Oct. 13</DATE> press release , cited multiple cases in which a felon previously convicted of a misdemeanor was later linked to multiple unsolved cases after DNA testing . 
One of these cases was <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> serial rapist <PERSON>Shannon Malnowski</PERSON> , who was convicted of a misdemeanor in <DATE>1992</DATE> . 
When <PERSON>Malnowski</PERSON> became a suspect for the rape of a <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville High School</ORGANIZATION> student in <DATE>2000</DATE> , he was connected to that case and two other rape cases dating back to <DATE>1996</DATE> . 
" If a DNA sample had been taken for the misdemeanors , he [ Malnowski ] would have been caught after the first rape and the latter two rapes would have never occurred , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said .
