Recently <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> introduced a new program to encourage victims of sexual assaults to report any occurrences of sexual violence . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Survivor Support Network</ORGANIZATION> , which debuted earlier this month , brings professors , administrators and graduate students together to create a network to encourage students who were sexually assaulted to overcome the stigma that exists and , in turn , encourages them to seek help . 
These efforts to increase the resources available to the victims of sexual assault are certainly necessary and a move in the right direction . 
However , an unacceptable stigma still exists that causes many sexual assaults to go unreported at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
In order to help change this , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should do more to educate the entire student body about the true nature of sexual assault and help remove the stigma that is entrenched in our society . 
Each one of us also plays a role by working to together to condemn sexual assault and get rid of the stigma that is associated with it . 
According to <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , director of sexual and domestic violence services at the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Women 's Center</ORGANIZATION> , " the stigma is not just at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
It is rooted in our culture and it is difficult to overcome . " 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> says victims of sexual assault are often blamed for what happened to them because there is a false perception that the victim could have avoided it , which causes many sexual assaults to go unreported . 
The number of reported sexual assaults at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> is certainly far lower than the actual number of incidents . 
According to the Rape , Abuse , and <ORGANIZATION>Incest National Network</ORGANIZATION> , only <PERCENT>41 percent</PERCENT> of sexual assaults are reported nationally while the majority goes unreported . 
In the 2006-2007 academic year , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> only investigated three reports of sexual assault while , presumably , many more went unreported . 
As a result , many of the perpetrators of sexual violence remain free to possibly assault again . 
Many victims also do not come forward to seek help . 
As <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said , " victims have trouble dealing with sexual assault and it derails their lives . " 
Seeking help is crucial to ensure that the victims of sexual assault begin to recover from the trauma they have endured . 
In order to encourage greater reporting of sexual assault , more has to be done to remove the social stigma that still surrounds sexual assault . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> currently has several programs to help educate the student body about sexual assault . 
Sexual <ORGANIZATION>Assault Peer Advocacy</ORGANIZATION> makes presentations to fraternities , sports teams and other organizations about the various aspects of sexual assault . 
The group One in Four makes similar presentations , but is composed of men and makes presentations to mostly male audiences . 
These groups certainly do a great job of educating students at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> about sexual assault . 
However , to be effective , the sexual assault education program must be mandatory for all students . 
Certain groups , such as fraternities , are required to have some sort of sexual assault education , but large numbers of students pass through their four years at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> without receiving any sort of instruction . 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> suggested that a mandatory sexual assault education occur during orientation before students enter the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> because " timing is important to teach people ... someone can get raped their first day at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . " 
This mandatory sexual assault education during orientation should also include the students ' parents to instill early on that sexual assault is not acceptable and that help is readily available . 
Educating students about sexual assault at orientation is just the beginning of the process . 
There should be a constant process of awareness and advocacy about sexual assault at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Each one of us can take the initiative to educate our peers and to report suspicious behavior to make sure that sexual assaults do not go unreported . 
We should come together as a community to say that sexual assault is not acceptable and that we will not tolerate it . 
The problems associated with sexual assault can only be overcome if we support victims and punish perpetrators . 
As <PERSON>Pat Cronin</PERSON> , president of One in Four , put it : " The stigma associated with reporting cases of sexual assault and rape can not be resolved with a few token programs or solutions -- it takes all of us . "
