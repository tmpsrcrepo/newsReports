<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily National</ORGANIZATION> sorority presidents requested <ORGANIZATION>National Panhellenic Conference</ORGANIZATION> sororities with <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> charters refrain from participating in the <DATE>2015</DATE> Boys Bid <DATE>Night last Saturday</DATE> in a move which generated discontent and confusion from alumni and sorority members . 
To adhere to the ban , sorority chapters were largely required to schedule mandatory social events or meetings for new pledges and members in place of organized bid night activities . 
Despite overall compliance , many students and alumni pushed back against the new restrictions and vocalized their opposition . 
Class of <DATE>2014</DATE> College alumnus <PERSON>Jake Berman</PERSON> , former president of <ORGANIZATION>Pi Lambda Phi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity , said he was entirely opposed to the ban . 
" I think the ban does two things : the most important is that it takes away the freedom of the women within the sororities , " <PERSON>Berman</PERSON> said . 
" It also puts fraternities in a bad light - [ it ] makes it seem like all fraternity men are unfit to be around sorority girls . " 
<PERSON>Berman</PERSON> said that following the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's controversial fall semester - during which Rolling Stone published an article , now discredited , describing a gang rape by <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity brothers in <DATE>fall 2012</DATE> - the ban only perpetuated the false image of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> and its Greek organizations as unsafe environments for women . 
" This ban on going out is spurred from the Rolling Stone incident , " <PERSON>Berman</PERSON> said . 
" I think it 's ridiculous to think that the entire <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> population of women is unsafe around the Greek population of men at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . " 
<PERSON>Berman</PERSON> also took issue with the decision because he believed it did not provide students agency . 
" I think that on the national level , it really makes it seem like students at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> are not allowed to make their own choices , " <PERSON>Berman</PERSON> said . 
" It makes fraternity men at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> seem dangerous . " 
<PERSON>Berman</PERSON> 's stance echoes many of the protests and complaints on Grounds . 
In a letter dated <DATE>Jan. 31</DATE> , more than 60 alumni of the <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Delta Pi</ORGANIZATION> sorority addressed a letter to <PERSON>Tammie Pinkston</PERSON> , international president of <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Delta Pi</ORGANIZATION> , arguing that while the concern for safety is valid , the ban marks a violation of individual rights . 
" We fail to see how [ the ban ] can possibly address the actual problem of sexual assault , " the letter read . 
" Sexual assault occurs at every single university , at parties and outside parties , to Greek women and to non-Greek women . 
These women are adults and their self-judgment should be trusted . " 
The alumni said that decisions coming from a national level - such as this one - make women involved in Greek life feel infantilized rather than empowered and safe . 
" We realize most of us have not set foot on Rugby Road in many years and things have changed , as they always do , " the letter read . 
" If there are particular facets of sorority participation in [ Boy 's ] Bid Night at only [ <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> ] that are disturbing to the <ORGANIZATION>NPC</ORGANIZATION> member Presidents , perhaps those facets should have been addressed specifically . " 
Class of <DATE>2014</DATE> College alumnus <PERSON>Katie McCafferty</PERSON> said that the responsibility for making Boys Bid Night a safe event should lie with both fraternities and sororities . " 
[ The <ORGANIZATION>National Chapters</ORGANIZATION> ] do seem like they have the girls ' best interest at heart , but I also think that the fraternities need to step up a little bit too , " <PERSON>McCafferty</PERSON> said . 
" The national fraternity chapters should be the ones sending out a letter , even just something informal requesting to take it easy this year at Boys Bid [ Night ] . " 
McCafferty , like <PERSON>Berman</PERSON> , agreed that safety should be a top concern for sororities and fraternities alike , but that the ban is not the most effective way to achieve this goal . 
" It 's just a very complex problem , " <PERSON>McCafferty</PERSON> said of safety on Grounds . 
" I do n't think there 's a very easy answer . "
