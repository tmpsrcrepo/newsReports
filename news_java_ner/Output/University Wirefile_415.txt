Student Council passed the Sexual Misconduct Awareness , Recovery and Tangible resolution <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> , outlining tangible points of advocacy on the issue of sexual assault at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
There are seven proposals under the SMART resolution calling for increased bystander action and reporting as well as greater transparency from the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> and a more rigorous assessment of the current state of sexual misconduct at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The resolution also states <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> is " dedicated not only to identifying these potential solutions , but to diligently working towards their implementation . " 
Brian Head , a third-year <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> student , spoke for One in Four , an all-male group which gives talks to males at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> about issues of sexual assault and misconduct . 
He expressed the group 's support of the resolution , providing a certain level of privacy is maintained for the victims of sexual assault . 
" We are speaking in favor of this resolution , " Head said . " 
[ But ] I think we should protect the survivors while still being transparent about the issues and assaults that are going on at UVa . " 
Honor Committee Chair <PERSON>Nicholas Hine</PERSON> , a third-year College student , expressed the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> 's support for the resolution . 
" I think honor is often seen as the solution to some of the frustrations we see with the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> and I think it 's a good conversation to have , but because of this highly restrictive legal-regulatory framework it ca n't be an honor offense , " <PERSON>Hine</PERSON> said . 
" What the SMART resolution does is it takes it beyond that stopping point . " 
Representatives from <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> 's SpeakUpUVa also spoke in support of the resolution . 
First-year College student <PERSON>Abraham Axler</PERSON> , chair of <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> 's representative body , said there is still a lot to be done . 
" I 'm extremely pleased that we passed this resolution unanimously but the real work happens in the coming weeks and months as we begin to implement the action items in the bill , " <PERSON>Axler</PERSON> said . 
<ORGANIZATION>International Studies Office</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Dudley Doane</PERSON> also spoke at the meeting about a new initiative launched by the <ORGANIZATION>International Studies Office</ORGANIZATION> - an archiving mechanism for study abroad students to record their stories abroad and for international students to record their experience on Grounds . 
" The idea is that this structure , which is mobile , would be used as a facility in which we would collect stories digitally , " <PERSON>Doane</PERSON> said . 
" So video , audio , tablets , and those stories would be archived . 
One objective would be to show the public what folks are doing overseas but then the facility could also be a place to hang out . 
It 's not large but it could be used in several ways . " 
The Architecture School is currently designing the structure and the <ORGANIZATION>Engineering School</ORGANIZATION> is working on developing a way to digitally collect these experiences .
