Every day , 30,000 or so children die across the world from easily preventable poverty . 
According to the <ORGANIZATION>National Victim Center</ORGANIZATION> , approximately 1,871 rapes occur everyday in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> alone . 
While I could list countless other statistics of tragic occurrences across the world and country , none of them are garnering as much time ( if any at all ) compared to <PERSON>Chandra Levy</PERSON> , <PERSON>Laci Peterson</PERSON> , <PERSON>JonBenet Ramsey</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Elizabeth Smart</ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON>Natalee Holloway</PERSON> . 
All of these women were abducted , but more curiously , all of them are white , relatively well-off women who received ( and continue to receive ) almost non-stop national and local press coverage . 
The most recent , <PERSON>Holloway</PERSON> , a graduating senior on a class trip to <LOCATION>Aruba</LOCATION> , has disappeared for more than a month ; in this month , she has dominated the coverage of cable news , even in the absence of substantive progress on her case . 
An irresponsible media has blown the <PERSON>Holloway</PERSON> 's case out of proportion , while surely heart wrenching and life changing for the involved family and friends . 
First of all , the media coverage of <PERSON>Holloway</PERSON> and previous cases is creating a misperception about the true statistics behind abduction ; this misperception is what psychologists label as an availability bias . 
In other words , based purely on watching the national media , one would conclude that the victim of a majority of kidnappings were middle-class , white women . 
In contrast , according to the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Bureau of Investigation</ORGANIZATION> , of the 47,600 abduction cases , <PERCENT>53 percent</PERCENT> were men , <PERCENT>61.7 percent were percent</PERCENT> either white or Hispanic , <PERCENT>29.1 percent</PERCENT> were black and the other <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> or so were Asian , Native American or unknown . 
<PERSON>Tom Rosenstiel</PERSON> , director of the Washington-based Project for Excellence in Journalism , put it clearly when he said , " To be blunt , blonde white chicks who go missing get covered and poor , black , Hispanic or other people of color who go missing do not get covered . 
You 're more likely to get coverage if you 're attractive than if you 're not . " 
Other than putting minorities in an obvious disadvantage when their loved ones are abducted , this slanted media coverage is not accurate on a macro-level and thus creates an availability bias . 
<PERSON>Dori Maynard</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>Robert Maynard Institute for Journalism Education</ORGANIZATION> , summed it up when saying , " In terms of giving citizens the information they need , I think we 're failing because we 're not giving an accurate portrayal of the world around them . " 
Even if there was no racism , ageism or discrimination based on attractiveness , the recalcitrant media coverage of one abduction causes resources available for all abductions to gravitate towards that one case . 
For example , <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> reported <DATE>last Saturday</DATE> that three F-16A Recce fighter jets armed with " infrared and sonar scanning " capacities will search for <PERSON>Holloway</PERSON> 's body -- the operating cost of a single Recce ranges from <MONEY>$ 3,000-5</MONEY> ,000 per hour . 
If one accepts a set cost of <MONEY>$ 3,000</MONEY> per hour for each Recce , then one hour of operation in <LOCATION>Aruba</LOCATION> , which is not even in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's jurisdiction , will cost approximately <MONEY>$ 9,000</MONEY> . 
To put this number in perspective , <MONEY>$ 9,000</MONEY> would be enough to buy 32,850 meals for starving children in <LOCATION>Calcutta</LOCATION> . 
While no one disagrees that <PERSON>Holloway</PERSON> 's family has suffered a terrible tragedy , one must wonder about the fairness of the special treatment they are receiving . 
According to the <ORGANIZATION>USA Today</ORGANIZATION> , " Across the country , more than 300,000 rapes and murders of women dating back 30 years remain unsolved . " 
In <DATE>2001</DATE> alone , 89,000 women were raped and 3,200 were murdered in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> ; <PERCENT>56 percent</PERCENT> of the rapes against women as well as <PERCENT>48 percent</PERCENT> of all murders went unsolved . 
Nonetheless , a huge majority of these cases will never appreciate the treatment given to the media 's favorites such as <PERSON>Holloway</PERSON> or <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> . 
Because the media has this power to focus attention and concern on certain issues , they have a responsibility to focus on the biggest issues such as genocide in <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> , poverty around the world , the lack of healthcare for 45 million Americans , or a macro-level approach to unsolved crimes , rather than an overly-personalized coverage that creates the perception that individuals such as <PERSON>Holloway</PERSON> are the only ones suffering the tragedy of abduction ( and possibly murder ) .
