<PERSON>John Pappas</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily American Studies</ORGANIZATION> faculty held a special edition of their regular event ' Pizza and Praxis ' to discuss prominent issues on Grounds since the publication of the Rolling Stone article . 
The English department faculty held a student-faculty discussion called " We Need to Talk . " 
" We pledge to engage with the administration , staff , students , and alumni to foster a safe community , grounded in dignity and integrity , free of violence , " the statement says . 
Amid a sea of protests , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> faculty have been active participants in the dialogue permeating Grounds which critically analyzes the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's culture and policies surrounding sexual assault . 
In addition to organizing a rally <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> on Beta Bridge , faculty from a swath of departments have issued statements and held discussions to help promote constructive change on Grounds , after a Rolling Stone article published last week thrust the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community into the national spotlight over the administration 's handling of sexual assault cases . 
Asst. Religious Studies Prof. <PERSON>Matt Hedstrom</PERSON> said faculty may be better positioned than students to help promote long-term change in culture and policies surrounding sexual assault . 
" Students , in a way , are limited based on the fact they 're here four years , " <ORGANIZATION>Hedstrom</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" If we 're talking about things that have a reach over a span of time , that 's where administrators and faculty and alumni provide , in some ways , a wider perspective than current students can . 
[ However , ] pressure from students can make a huge , huge difference . " 
Faculty <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> responds <ORGANIZATION>The Faculty Senate</ORGANIZATION> 's executive council released a statement <DATE>Nov. 21</DATE> , calling upon the entire faculty of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to participate in the process of amending the " culture that allows violence to occur . " 
The letter , signed by Executive Council Chair <PERSON>Joe Garofalo</PERSON> , Chair-Elect <PERSON>Nina Solenski</PERSON> and Past-Chair <PERSON>Chris Holstege</PERSON> , along with <PERSON>Greg Saathoff</PERSON> , chair of the <ORGANIZATION>General Faculty Council</ORGANIZATION> , condemns the sexual assault described in the Rolling Stone article and urges the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community to act with " sensitivity and sound judgment " while the police conduct their investigation into the allegations . 
" We pledge to engage with the administration , staff , students , and alumni to foster a safe community , grounded in dignity and integrity , free of violence , " the statement reads . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Faculty Senate</ORGANIZATION> will hold a meeting <DATE>Dec. 17</DATE> which help determine what specific action the faculty will take to achieve these goals , <PERSON>Garofalo</PERSON> said in an email . 
" Our <ORGANIZATION>Faculty Senate</ORGANIZATION> meeting will be devoted to an open discussion of sexual violence , focusing on what is being done and what actions need to be taken , " he said . 
<PERSON>Saathoff</PERSON> said the entire community - faculty , staff and students - shares the responsibility to make real change in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to protect the students from sexual assault . 
But he acknowledged faculty may play a special role in the process . 
" I think it 's important to listen to perspectives of the faculty and compare and contrast what the situation is here with others , " <PERSON>Saathoff</PERSON> said . 
" Now that this topic has been opened up I think it gives us an opportunity as a faculty to listen even more closely and thoughtfully . " 
The English department said the <ORGANIZATION>Faculty Senate</ORGANIZATION> 's statement failed to capture the necessary activism and policy changes the administration must take . 
In an open letter , the department highlighted the appointment of <PERSON>Mark Filip</PERSON> , a member of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity , to serve as independent counsel to review the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual assault policies as a clear failing on the administration 's failure to adequately respond to the issue . 
A <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> party is the scene of a graphic gang rape described in the Rolling Stone article . 
Attorney <ORGANIZATION>General Mark Herring</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> that Filip would not serve as independent counsel in the investigation , given his ties to the fraternity . 
" We just wanted to voice our outrage about that obvious conflict of interest , " English Prof. <PERSON>Caroline Rody</PERSON> said . 
" By the time we made the statement , he had already been removed from consideration . " 
Departments foster faculty-student dialogue The English department also hosted an event <DATE>Monday</DATE> titled " We Need to Talk , " which brought students and faculty together to meet and discuss the article and sexual assault on Grounds . 
The talk , held in Minor Hall , brought a diverse range of people to discuss the issues through a literary lens , before breaking into small groups so students could voice their frustrations and interpretations of recent events . 
Because of the toll these events have had on the student body , the professors thought it necessary to provide an outlet for expression , <PERSON>Rody</PERSON> said . 
" We need to create a movement for students to think through these awful events and all of the problems with sexual violence on this campus , " she said . 
English Prof. <PERSON>Brad Pasanek</PERSON> said after the article was published he felt his students " did n't know how to talk about what 's going on . " 
" They had a lot of emotions and feelings and did n't know how to articulate how they felt , " he said . " 
[ Students ] did n't know how to talk about what was happening , and were n't sure how to speak in a way that would effect change . " 
English Prof. <PERSON>Gregory Orr</PERSON> said the event was part of an effort to foster what he hoped would be a student-led reforms . 
" All we can do is gather the energy of people who want it to change and to be part of that energy , " he said . 
Pasanek said he was pleased with how the students expressed their thoughts , and he said there need to be more outlets for student expression . 
" Our students are extremely articulate , it 's just that they just do n't have places to speak , there are n't opportunities , " <PERSON>Pasanek</PERSON> said . 
" Every time an undergraduate opens their mouth and speaks to me , I 'm always blown away . " 
The American Studies program held a similar event - reframing its regular " Pizza and Praxis " event , traditionally a chance for students to informally interact with their professors , into a candid dialogue about sexual violence at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
<ORGANIZATION>Hedstrom</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>American Studies</ORGANIZATION> program is uniquely situated to foster this type of discussion . 
" That 's what we do in American studies , " <ORGANIZATION>Hedstrom</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" We study culture . 
We think about how culture works - how it 's produced and propagated , and what kinds of texts and sources and institutions make it come alive in people 's lives . " 
Assoc. American Studies Prof. <PERSON>Sandhya Shukla</PERSON> said she was shocked when she read the Rolling Stone article . 
" I also felt a deep sense of regret that I had not connected with students about this issue before , " <PERSON>Shukla</PERSON> said in an email . 
" These revelations have mobilized many faculty , myself included , to commit to know exactly what is going on , and how we can take a stand to change the situation . " 
Assoc. American Studies Prof. <PERSON>Anna Brickhouse</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>American Studies</ORGANIZATION> program is committed to being an outlet for student perspectives . 
" As everyone knows , there is now a national conversation on this issue taking place , " <PERSON>Brickhouse</PERSON> said in an email . 
" We want to be sure our students have a place to talk about it and to think about positive steps that they and we can take for our university community . " 
American Studies faculty member <PERSON>Lisa Goff</PERSON> said it is important to self-examine - something emphasized in the program 's pushback against American exceptionalism and directly applicable to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
" Loving a place , and even feeling loyal to a place , should not stop you from facing hard truths , " she said . 
The French department held a similar discussion between students and faculty . 
The event sought " to discuss , vent frustrations and concerns , and begin to deal with the troubling , indeed painful events that have impacted our community recently , " said French Prof. <PERSON>Ari Blatt</PERSON> , who chairs the department . 
Next Steps The <ORGANIZATION>Faculty Senate Planning Committee</ORGANIZATION> will lead a faculty meeting next <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , <DATE>Dec. 2</DATE> , to more squarely address and debate the ways faculty can take action in response to the Rolling Stone article . 
<ORGANIZATION>Planning Committee Co-Chair Rae Blumberg</ORGANIZATION> said she hopes the meeting will foster collaboration which creates policy to prevent sexual assault and improve <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> response efforts to be more " respectful and helpful to the people involved . " 
<PERSON>Blumberg</PERSON> said she was hopeful for how the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community could come together to deal with the tragic issue of sexual assault . 
" Out of this potential disaster it can lead to something really good , " she said . " 
[ It is ] bringing people of different levels together in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . " 
The meeting , an extra hour long , will be a " free ranging conversation " on any number of ways the committee can develop a program to deal with the issue in a concrete way . 
Though he said the faculty-led response is important , <PERSON>Saathoff</PERSON> emphasized the most important impetus of change is still the opinion of the students . 
" Before proposing any kind of strategy , I think it 's really important that we hear from as many students as possible who love this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> as much as anyone here , " he said .
