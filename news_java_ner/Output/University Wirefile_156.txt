Catholic archdioceses throughout the country have faced mounting accusations that they ignored allegations of sexual misconduct on the part of their priests . 
Some of these allegations , including those in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> , have proved to be true . 
These systemic problems have placed the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in the midst of a crisis as to its legitimacy . 
This crisis hits at core questions of the <ORGANIZATION>Church</ORGANIZATION> 's ability to act as faithful and trustworthy stewards of its members . 
Its members should take affirmative steps and demand that their dioceses open their personnel procedures more than they have done up to this point . 
These controversies have two layers to them . 
The first concerns the actual child molesters themselves -- the priests and leaders who took advantage of the young boys and girls in their care . 
Such individuals have engaged in the kinds of actions that pervert and blaspheme the entire notion of a trustworthy " father figure . " 
The second layer , the recklessly poor personnel policies carried out by various parishes , exacerbates the first set of problems by allowing deviant individuals to continue their pattern of disgustingly aberrant behavior . 
The recent happenings in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> reflect the poor policies that segments of the <ORGANIZATION>Church</ORGANIZATION> have followed . 
Generally , when a child accused a priest of engaging in some kind of sexual act , the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> archdiocese attempted to handle the problem " in house . " 
Lacking an explicit policy from the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> to report such accusations to civil authorities , the archdiocese would attempt to rehabilitate offenders . 
Once declared " cured " by Church psychiatrists , the priests would be reassigned to parishes that did not know of the priest 's prior problems . 
As an example of the effects of these policies , the <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> archdiocese has settled claims from 50 individuals against one particular priest , <PERSON>John Geoghan</PERSON> . 
Throughout the <DATE>1980s</DATE> , members from at least three parishes complained of abuse from this individual . 
Apparently , not enough was done to respond to these accusations to protect future children . 
Mr. <PERSON>Geoghan</PERSON> is only one former church leader whose prior bad acts have surfaced . 
A Roman Catholic bishop in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Anthony O'Connell</PERSON> , recently resigned , admitting to 25-year old allegations that he sexually abused a child in his care . 
Amazingly , <PERSON>O'Connell</PERSON> originally assumed his position by replacing a bishop who stepped down due to similar allegations . 
One of <PERSON>O'Connell</PERSON> 's victims has made use of the RICO statute to allege that all American bishops have " conspired to keep abuse claims secret , often through hushed financial settlements with victims . " 
Obviously , such charges likely are overblown . 
Not all bishops were complicit in these poor policies . 
Parishioners , however , should be prompted to take action to return some legitimacy to the <ORGANIZATION>Church</ORGANIZATION> . 
People should not assume that a majority of priests or Church leaders have consciously engaged in bad acts . 
Instead , a number of dioceses from across the country have allowed bad actors to remain in powerful positions . 
They have allowed recidivist sexual predators to remain in contact with the very people they victimized in the past . 
It is clear that a number of leaders , including <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> archbishop <PERSON>Bernard Law</PERSON> , knew that the people they reassigned had serious sexual problems that could not simply be cured through conventional therapy . 
To be fair , all archdioceses now have a zero tolerance policy with regard to sexually predatory behavior . 
The <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> diocese , in particular , has claimed that it has released information of past abusers . 
Unfortunately , nobody can know for certain that the list of released names is complete . 
The people who claim to have reformed their parishes are largely the same people who carried out the previous bad policies . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> is unique in that its doctrinal faith is linked to its corporate operation . 
The Church , as an entity , matters to everybody who claims the Catholic faith . 
The Church , as an entity , needs to respond to these revelations more effectively than it has to this point . 
Those Church leaders who consciously reassigned those known to have sexual problems should undergo some form of public shaming and probably should resign their positions . 
These changes would lead to some turbulence , but it would send a signal that institutional problems would be met with institutional solutions . 
The faithful Catholics who are rightfully disgusted by these behaviors and policies should ask their leaders about what those leaders knew . 
They should demand information about the priests into whose care they trust their children . 
Ultimately , the <ORGANIZATION>Church</ORGANIZATION> will survive these storms of criticism . 
With the right changes , it will survive these changes without losing its members . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Church</ORGANIZATION> , to keep its members ' trust , owes them some degree of healing action .
