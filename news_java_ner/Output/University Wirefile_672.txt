<PERSON>Richard Dizon</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Frank Atkinson</PERSON> spoke at a College Republican meeting <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University College Republicans</ORGANIZATION> hosted guest speaker <PERSON>Frank Atkinson</PERSON> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> . 
Atkinson is a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> and chairman of <ORGANIZATION>McGuireWoods Consulting LLC</ORGANIZATION> . 
Atkinson is also the author of two books on contemporary Virginian politics , " The Dynamic Dominion " and " <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Vanguard</ORGANIZATION> , " published in <DATE>1991</DATE> and <DATE>2006</DATE> , respectively . 
Previously , he served in the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Justice</ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> and more recently as legal counsel and the policy director for the former <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>George Allen</PERSON> . 
Atkinson began the guest lecture by expressing his support of youth involvement in conservative politics . 
" Let me say to you how much I am encouraged by all your work and how active you are in College Republicans , " <PERSON>Atkinson</PERSON> said to members . 
" I 'm really a big believer that folks need to get involved and give back . " 
Atkinson then promoted a dialogue on prominent issues members believe need addressing within the Republican Party as well as overarching concerns regarding the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> in the 2014-2015 academic year . 
Members responded by identifying the current disparity among factions within the Republican party , the alienation of various minorities , the debate over the existence of climate change and LGBTQ rights as several key dilemmas facing the party . 
Atkinson reiterated that Republicans have largely factionalized in recent years . 
" It can be a frustrating time to be involved , " <PERSON>Atkinson</PERSON> said . 
" There has been a dichotomy with various factions for at least the whole post-war period and <DATE>last half of the twentieth century</DATE> . 
Division in a party is n't new . 
It 's inevitable in any growing organization . " 
<PERSON>Atkinson</PERSON> also asked members to share what specifically has driven them to participate in the organization and underlying values they share with the Republican party . 
Responses centered largely on conservative economics , foreign policy and social issues . 
Atkinson offered his take on foreign affairs specifically . 
" During the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> Era , foreign policy was the glue that held everything together , " <PERSON>Atkinson</PERSON> said . 
" Since that time , the international situation we 're dealing with is much more fragmented . " 
Atkinson also inquired about members ' support for potential Republican party nominees for president . 
Support varied among potential candidates <PERSON>Jeb Bush</PERSON> , <PERSON>Chris Christie</PERSON> , <PERSON>Rand Paul</PERSON> , <PERSON>Marco Rubio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ted Cruz</PERSON> . 
Regardless of the individual chosen to represent the Republican party , <PERSON>Atkinson</PERSON> expressed optimism for the upcoming <DATE>2016</DATE> presidential election . 
" Someone will emerge out of this process and come out on top to unite the Republican party , " <PERSON>Atkinson</PERSON> said . 
" Whoever captures the nomination in <DATE>2016</DATE> is likely to win the election . " 
The second half of <ORGANIZATION>Atkinson</ORGANIZATION> 's guest lecture centered on topics relevant to the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> . 
Atkinson focused on the student reaction to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's handling of sexual assault policy since the <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE> Rolling Stone article detailing the rape of a second-year College student occurring in <DATE>2012</DATE> . 
Although Rolling Stone retracted support for the article shortly after publication , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is still grappling with how to change sexual assault policies . 
" I do think on this is would be a big mistake to turn the corner and say this is n't on us , " <PERSON>Atkinson</PERSON> said . 
" It really produced some deep feeling and stress . 
There 's a natural human temptation or tendency to take difficult issues and say we 've come through the worst of that , let 's think about something else . " 
Atkinson also commented on the lingering effects of the article on <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> life and how the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> community has been represented . 
" Students had most thoughtful responses when this all broke out , " <PERSON>Atkinson</PERSON> said . 
" It showed how the culture of student leadership here distinguishes U.Va . 
from most any other place . " 
Atkinson mentioned the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> is anxiously awaiting the results of an independent investigation of the incident conducted by <ORGANIZATION>O'Melveny</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> . 
" Even though the spotlight is off , we 're all eager to get a report back to review what happened in the <DATE>fall</DATE> and how it was handled , " <PERSON>Atkinson</PERSON> said . 
" We initiated the report - not the Attorney General or the governor . " 
Whether in politics or <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> affairs , <PERSON>Atkinson</PERSON> stressed to members the need for active student involvement .
