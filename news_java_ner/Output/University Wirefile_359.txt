University of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> students who fall victim to sexual assault now have access to another form of support on Grounds : the <ORGANIZATION>Survivor Support Network</ORGANIZATION> . 
The network 's " goal is to give students an increased number of safe people to talk to and to increase reporting " of sexual assault , said <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , director of <ORGANIZATION>Sexual and Domestic Violence Services</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Women 's Center</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said she helped organize the network along with fourth-year <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Julianne Koch</PERSON> . 
The program launched <DATE>last Wednesday</DATE> , when 13 professors , teaching assistants and student advisors completed a two-hour training session aimed at working with victims of sexual assault , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> also noted that the network is making training available to Resident Staff members in an attempt to broaden the organization 's support base . 
" I 'd like to see this program become as widespread as Safe Space , " <PERSON>Koch</PERSON> said in reference to the program that provides faculty support for lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer students , adding that the new network is the first program of its kind to incorporate faculty members on a regular basis . 
During last week 's training session , participants listened to a group of student survivors , reacted to hypothetical situations and discussed definitions of terms associated with sexual assault , <PERSON>Koch</PERSON> said . 
She said each participant also left with a 60-page manual of additional material . 
According to <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> , members of the network will identify themselves by displaying a sticker on their office door or window . 
The sticker features an awareness ribbon colored purple , representing domestic violence , and teal , representing sexual assault . 
If an advisor or authority figure is identifiable as a member of the program , <PERSON>Thornton</PERSON> said , victims should feel more comfortable approaching him or her with their situation . 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said she believes it is important for victims to talk to someone with the skills to properly handle the situation , rather than just confiding in a friend . 
" Friends want to be supportive , but really do n't know what to do , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said , adding that she feels that friends are as equally uninformed as victims about available resources and the legal aspects of sexual violence . 
<PERSON>Walker Thornton</PERSON> , executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Resource Agency</ORGANIZATION> , noted that sexual assault is one of the most under-reported crimes . 
" Between 20 to <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of sexual assaults are actually reported , and probably <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of sexual assault survivors never tell anyone , even a friend , " he said . 
According to <LOCATION>Koch</LOCATION> , some victims need more than emotional support while recovering , adding that the network gives professors and TAs a better understanding of the warning signs of a student who is experiencing depression or post-traumatic stress because of sexual violence . 
For example , <PERSON>Koch</PERSON> noted , a straight-A student might stop coming to class or turning in assignments as a result of such violence . 
Training through the network can help " provide a way to open conversation with that student " or even encourage professors to give an extension on an assignment , according to <PERSON>Koch</PERSON> . 
She added that this could be what keeps a victim from failing a class and " becoming a downward spiral . " 
The Survivor Support Network is the latest addition to a number of sexual violence awareness programs at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> including 1 in 4 and the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Peer Advocacy</ORGANIZATION> group . 
" Sexual violence is a really complicated topic , " <PERSON>Thornton</PERSON> said . 
" Most of us are n't equipped to deal with it . "
