Cavalier Daily Students and <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> community members held a protest in front of the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity house <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> . 
The protest , which challenged the prominence of sexual assault at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and questioned policies in place to prevent it , ended in four arrests . 
The protest was part of a series of responses by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community to a recently published Rolling Stone article alleging a brutal gang rape at a party in the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity house . 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Sarah Hart</PERSON> said protests like this can help to restore community pride in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I do n't think this is a surprise , most of us have known about this issue , and this is a chance to take action about something we all feel passionate about and can control , " <PERSON>Hart</PERSON> said . 
" I do n't think we feel proud of our school right now and protests like this show we are not passive bystanders . 
They show the administration how much we care . " 
At the end of the protest , several participants sat on the steps of the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity house . 
When police asked them to leave , four refused and were arrested for trespassing on private property , according to <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police</ORGANIZATION> spokesperson <PERSON>Steve Upman</PERSON> . 
" The police response was astounding , " fourth-year College student <PERSON>Greg Lewis</PERSON> said . 
" The arrests seemed unnecessary due to the peaceful nature of the protest . " 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Billy Baker</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community needs to step up and support those who are taking action . 
" The [ Rolling Stone ] article made me feel like the issue has been covered up for so long , " <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> said . 
" I really hope the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> takes this article and the protest movement as a sign that they need to be more transparent about the way they deal with sexual assault . " 
Protesters gathered together into groups for survivors to share their experiences and for others to express their concerns . 
" No matter how much a person has been drinking , if he or she can not say ' no , ' it does not mean ' yes , ' " one survivor said . 
Another survivor added that there are always going to be predators , no matter how much people are educated , and the community needs to support survivors . 
Passionate community members suggested immediate action , such as putting sober supervisors from the community in each of the fraternity houses and having the fraternities publicly sign a pledge endorsing the prevention of sexual assault . 
Third-year College student Will <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> said he heard some very valuable suggestions for action community members can take . 
" This is an issue that seems like it needs very systematic , extreme action to at least put a very large dent in the problem , " <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> said . 
" Protests like this one are good because they get people talking . " 
Community member <PERSON>Jeanne Catherine Gray</PERSON> said as a <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> business owner , she has concerns about the safety of people living here and advocates for peaceful protests . 
" The only way thing [ s ] change is if you talk about what 's happening , " <PERSON>Gray</PERSON> said . 
" If you pretend that everything is fine and smile and walk about , then the things that are actually going on underneath the surface never really get dealt with . 
I am not an advocate of anger or violent protests of any form ; I think the most important things is to organize groups and to work together towards the goals that we want to see happen . " 
Community member <PERSON>Deborah Norton</PERSON> said she came to the protest because nothing is going to change if people do n't stand up for what is right . 
" My husband works at U.Va . 
and I was just horrified by the article , " <PERSON>Norton</PERSON> said . 
" I know that that stuff happens , but having it be so real and so graphic , I feel really strongly that fraternities need to stop and be held accountable . " 
Sexual assault is an issue that affects everyone , <PERSON>Gray</PERSON> said . 
" This is a goal everybody cares about ; everybody wants their kids to be safe , whether it is your son or your daughter , " <PERSON>Gray</PERSON> said . 
" No matter what kind of violence they face , no parent wants to see their child suffer . 
It concerns mothers and students and faculty and staff and it is something that needs to be dealt with immediately and for long-term . "
