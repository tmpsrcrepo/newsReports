" The more evidence that you have in any case , the better off you are , " <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said . 
Fingerprints are " a good indication and a good piece of evidence , " he said . 
He added that fingerprints and DNA evidence carry about the same weight when presented in court . 
Davis allegedly broke into the victim 's apartment , located in the <LOCATION>Venable</LOCATION> area between 15th Street NW and Rugby Road off of <LOCATION>Grady Avenue</LOCATION> , shortly after <TIME>4 a.m.</TIME> on the <TIME>night</TIME> of <DATE>Aug. 26</DATE> . 
He then reportedly raped the victim while holding her male friend at gunpoint .
