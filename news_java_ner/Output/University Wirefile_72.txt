The <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> and a group of concerned parents are combining resources to offer a <MONEY>$ 10,000</MONEY> reward for information leading to the arrest of a man who broke into a female student 's apartment <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , held up her male friend at gunpoint and then raped her . 
The anonymous group of parents met with <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> officials <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to double the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's initial <MONEY>$ 5,000</MONEY> offer . 
President <PERSON>John T. Casteen III</PERSON> praised the parents ' initiative during his speech to first-year students and their parents <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> . 
A large reward could lead to a swift arrest of the suspect , <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> said . 
" We 're convinced it will make a significant difference in the investigation , " said <PERSON>Leonard W. Sandridge</PERSON> , executive vice president and chief financial officer . 
The suspect , described as a black , heavyset man between 5 feet 8 inches and six feet tall , in his mid-20s , also robbed the two students . 
The incident occurred in the <LOCATION>Venable</LOCATION> area , between 15th Street NW and Rugby Road off of <LOCATION>Grady Avenue</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Police Lt. <PERSON>J. E.</PERSON> " Chip " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
Harding declined to give more a more specific location to protect the identity of the victims . 
After returning home from a party at about <TIME>4 a.m.</TIME> , the victims returned home to the female 's residence . 
" The male , a friend , stayed the night and they fell asleep on a bed with their clothes on , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
" The male awoke to a handgun being pushed against the side of his head . 
The assailant told them to switch places " on the bed . 
The assailant would not let the male look at him and blindfolded the female with her shirt after he raped her , he said . 
The description the victims were able to give <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> police came from " instinct " and what little they were able to glimpse of their attacker , he added . 
After the rape , the assailant " forced the female to take a shower , " to ensure no evidence was left that might assist police in determining his identity , <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
Although there was a second female in another bedroom in the apartment , the two students told the assailant no one else was home . 
But when the assailant heard a toilet flush he became agitated and made the victims knock on the bedroom door of the other student . 
She was unaware there was an intruder in the house and did not answer the door . 
Before leaving , the assailant forced the two victims into a room and threatened to kill them if they left or called the police , <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
Before notifying the police , the male student drove the female student to the <ORGANIZATION>University Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> at about 7:30 or <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> , he said . 
Four forensic detectives are inspecting the entire house for DNA , fibers and fingerprints and compiling a list of potential suspects , he added . 
Investigators have not excluded the possibility that the incident is related to an <DATE>Oct. 15</DATE> rape that occurred under Beta Bridge on Rugby Road , but the two incidents do not appear to be related , due to the rapists ' different behaviors , he said . 
Both <ORGANIZATION>University Police and Charlottesville Police</ORGANIZATION> increased their patrol of the area due to the incident . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> said they have been fielding calls from concerned parents and students . 
In response , police officials and <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administrators are trying to step up community safety awareness . 
" We are providing some extra patrol in that area and assisting the city in any way we find possible , " University Police Captain <PERSON>Michael Coleman</PERSON> said . 
" We have security seminars in all first year dorms and <ORGANIZATION>Rape Aggression Defense</ORGANIZATION> classes for women . 
We also encourage all students to use the <ORGANIZATION>Escort Service</ORGANIZATION> and if walking , travel in groups . " 
Unfortunately crimes against students do happen , despite safety precautions , <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Mike Sheffield</PERSON> said . 
" We 're not immune to any types of crime or criminal activity , " <PERSON>Sheffield</PERSON> said . 
" You can put all the safe practices in place and still be victimized . "
