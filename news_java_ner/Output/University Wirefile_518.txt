Residents opened their rooms to the broader <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , inviting them to enjoy free food , drinks and blankets , and play outdoor games on the <LOCATION>Lawn</LOCATION> .

The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> was reeling from the death of second-year College student <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> , who was missing for almost six weeks before a search party found her remains in a rural area outside <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , as well as the death of second-year student <ORGANIZATION>Connor Cormier</ORGANIZATION> . 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Sky Miller</PERSON> , the Lawn senior resident , said the idea for the gathering developed out of a conversation between Lawn residents earlier in the week . 
" An important part of this was showing to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> that we feel strongly , and that the Lawn is a place for all students to come together , " <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said Lawn residents recognized the visible nature of the space , and expressed their desire to do something which would make a statement . 
He said the gathering received unanimous support from Lawn residents . 
" The fact that it 's not individual clubs having their own events as usual shows the gathering is for everyone and makes a statement in itself , " <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said . 
Organized within 24 hours , <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said the event required a good deal of community cooperation . 
The doors to each room displayed signs simply stating , " Together , " which acknowledged the fact that the gathering 's intention was to unite people on the <LOCATION>Lawn</LOCATION> . 
Fourth-year College student and <LOCATION>Lawn</LOCATION> resident <PERSON>Sandra Menendez</PERSON> said she was very pleased with the gathering , and always tries to keep her door open for friends whenever they may need a space . 
" I was really appreciative of it - it was really nice for me to be able to provide a safe space for my friends , " <PERSON>Menendez</PERSON> said . 
Menendez sent an email blast to more than 200 people about the gathering . 
" I had people from all walks of my <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> career stop by , and it was nice to see people from my different friend groups mingle , " <PERSON>Menendez</PERSON> said . " 
[ The Lawn community ] has a couple of initiatives in place and is continuing to meet to determine action , but it 's all still in the works . "
