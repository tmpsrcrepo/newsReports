Student self-governance is unique to our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and one of its most compelling features , but , as I have argued before , there are situations that merit its limitation . 
One such situation is the adjudication of sexual misconduct cases , overseen by the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> ( SMB ) . 
Currently , the <ORGANIZATION>SMB</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> consists of " faculty , professional staff , and students who are trained to apply the Sexual Misconduct Policy . " 
There are roughly 30 members , at least half of which are actually students , according to <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> , associate dean of students and the current chair of the <ORGANIZATION>SMB</ORGANIZATION> . 
Student members either are nominated or nominate themselves , at which point Dean Eramo interviews them and passes recommended candidates on to the vice president , who makes a final determination . 
The interview process is largely informal - there is no official application , and there is no standard set of criteria , apart from more intangible qualities like maturity . 
<ORGANIZATION>Student Board</ORGANIZATION> members go through the same extensive training as faculty and staff members , and their perspective is undoubtedly helpful . 
As <PERSON>Dean Eramo</PERSON> put it , " Students have a unique sense of what the environment is like . . . and they bring that perspective to a case . " 
But , unfortunately , what they also bring to a case is a higher potential for conflicts of interest . 
Of course , if a student knows the accused or the complainant in a case , he can not sit on the panel for that case . 
But a student SMB member 's objectivity is questionable when another SMB member is involved , either as the accused , the complainant or a witness in the case . 
For <ORGANIZATION>SMB</ORGANIZATION> members who are sitting on the case , the testimony of a fellow member may hold more weight than opposing testimonies . 
Additionally , having a peer in the room could cause discomfort for any of the students involved in the case . 
While Dean <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> said she has never experienced either a complainant or an accused expressing discomfort with having a student seated , she admits , " I recognize that they might not tell me if they were uncomfortable because that 's sort of the way the process is , and they may not think they have a say in it . " 
Dean <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> did note that student SMB members have expressed discomfort over interacting with students in the aftermath of a case . 
This is certainly not unique to the SMB ; it probably occurs more frequently following <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> or Honor trials . 
But a victim of sexual assault or an alleged perpetrator of sexual assault probably feels much more significant emotional trauma following an SMB case . 
It is possible that having a peer sit on the <ORGANIZATION>SMB</ORGANIZATION> could have the opposite effect and make the students in the case feel somewhat more comfortable knowing their perspectives have a voice on the panel . 
But the level of information - and the personal nature of that information - being shared with an unfamiliar peer is daunting . 
Our school has an active rumor mill , and while SMB members are undoubtedly well-trained and trustworthy , it 's not hard to see why a student may have concerns about the confidentiality of a case . 
Dean <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> noted that one major concern of complainants is " controlling information " - add to that the high chance of running into a student SMB member on Grounds , and the entire affair could become increasingly traumatic . 
Imagine describing an act of sexual violence taken against you , or being falsely accused of committing sexual violence , and then having to interact with a peer who not only helped determine the outcome of your case , but now knows intimate details about you that many might not know at all , details which you now are unable to control . 
Even the federal government , with its current investigation into the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , may be evaluating the importance or appropriateness of student involvement in the SMB , while the <ORGANIZATION>SMB</ORGANIZATION> itself reevaluates these policies . 
That said , removing student involvement from the <ORGANIZATION>SMB</ORGANIZATION> seems somehow drastic . 
While retaining student members of the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> brings up many potential problems , it also preserves our commitment to maintaining our value for student input . 
Perhaps a solution is not having students adjudicate cases , but rather having their input in an advisory capacity . 
While it would be more difficult to gain a student perspective without an actual presence at the panel , <PERSON>Dean Eramo</PERSON> did note that the student perspective " comes up within the investigation ... because there 's a lot of student interviews generally in the case reports . " 
With this existing information and the possibility of bringing in students unrelated to specific cases to answer <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> members ' questions and shed light on different social scenes at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , it seems possible - if not difficult - to gain a student 's perspective without the potential risk of causing discomfort and biasing a panel . 
Student input is both necessary and important , but it should be confined to an advisory role , as opposed to an adjudicative one .
