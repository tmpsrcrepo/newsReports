Pinkleton said <ORGANIZATION>Green Dot</ORGANIZATION> trains bystanders to not only understand what to do in a potentially dangerous situation , but also know personally how comfortable they are with taking action in such as situation . 
During <ORGANIZATION>Winter Break</ORGANIZATION> , 150 University students and faculty participated in a four-day Green Dot program which aims to decrease violence on school campuses and within communities . 
The program 's <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> incarnation placed particular emphasis on sexual assault , stalking and intimate partner violence . 
The initial stage of the Green Dot program focuses on improving bystander intervention . 
<PERSON>Nicole Thomas</PERSON> , prevention coordinator for the Office of the Dean of Students , said those trained during the break will help further expand the program at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" All of those people [ trained in the program ] are serving on a subcommittee for [ Green Dot ] implementation , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said . 
" Everyone who went through the four days is either helping with event planning , bystander intervention training or research and assessment . " 
Thomas said trainees will serve on seven different committees to expand the scope of Green Dot beyond bystander intervention . " 
[ <ORGANIZATION>Green Dot</ORGANIZATION> ] has other components like community mobilization , relationship building , social marketing and events , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said . 
" The goal is that a student is touched by the message of being an active bystander multiple times during their college career . 
The message of [ the Green Dot program ] is that you can choose to do a proactive or a reactive behavior that stops violence if you see something happening . " 
Third-year College student <PERSON>Alex Pinkleton</PERSON> said the program uses red dots and green dots to symbolize where on Grounds community members are most at risk of sexual assault . 
Red dots represent harmful or dangerous situations , while green dots represent locations where Green Dot has taken took place . 
" Sexual assault is n't a tumor , but rather a bunch of red dots on a map of the campus , " <PERSON>Pinkleton</PERSON> said . 
" And then , there are a lot of green dots that counteract these red dots , and they 'll prevent [ red dots ] from occurring in the future . " 
Third-year College student Grace <PERSON>Finley</PERSON> said students who went through the <ORGANIZATION>Green Dot</ORGANIZATION> training are planning to launch of the Green Dot program at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> alongside a number of faculty members . 
" We have officially not only received the bystander training , but also received certification to give bystander training , " <PERSON>Finley</PERSON> said . 
" The students are now all involved in committees with the faculty . 
Once the Green Dot program is launched , [ other ] students will be able to actually be trained in how to be an active bystander . " 
<PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said the program 's launch is planned for late <DATE>March</DATE> . 
Each training session will have a capacity of around 35 people , she said . " 
[ The training is ] six hours long and really interactive , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said . " 
[ Any ] more people than that would make it really chaotic , so before the launch we 're going to make sure we 're practicing our content and training specific groups of students . " 
<PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said the newly trained group will train students from many different organizations across Grounds with the ultimate aim of reaching a diverse cross-section of the community . 
" If before the launch we only train one or two groups , then people across Grounds are n't going to know what we 're talking about , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said . 
" But if we 're able to train student leaders and students across Grounds , then the word will get out a little quicker . " 
<PERSON>Dillon Kuhn</PERSON> , assistant director for employer relations in the <ORGANIZATION>Office of University Career Services</ORGANIZATION> , was trained through <ORGANIZATION>Green Dot</ORGANIZATION> and will serve on the program 's relationship building team . 
" The idea is to really look at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> as a whole , " <PERSON>Kuhn</PERSON> said . " 
[ We aim to ] figure out how to best seek out support across the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and figure out what students , what staff and what faculty we need to have conversations with . " 
<PERSON>Kuhn</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Green Dot</ORGANIZATION> 's larger goal is engage the entire community in the fight against sexual assault . 
" The idea is that [ advocating against sexual assault ] does n't take a lot , " <PERSON>Kuhn</PERSON> said . 
" There 's not necessarily large growth required . 
Really , it 's just about educating everyone here that we can all be a part of the solution , and restoring the idea of looking out for each other . " 
Pinkleton said the Green Dot program trains bystanders not only to understand what to do in a potentially dangerous situation , but also on how to personally determine how comfortable one is with taking action in such as situation . 
" It 's really important for everyone to think for , of themselves , ' What would you actually do ? ' 
Pinkleton said . 
" A lot of times people will nod their heads , and say , ' Yeah , I should stop that scenario , ' but then they have n't thought it through completely to know exactly what to do . "
