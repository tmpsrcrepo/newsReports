The <ORGANIZATION>General Council of Phi Delta Theta</ORGANIZATION> fraternity has suspended the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> chapter 's charter for violating its risk-management policies . 
The <ORGANIZATION>General Council</ORGANIZATION> is the board that governs the national actions of the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta</ORGANIZATION> Theta fraternity . 
According to <PERSON>Bob Biggs</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta Theta</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president , the action " officially closes " Phi Delta Theta on Grounds . 
The charter was suspended in <DATE>May</DATE> . 
The risk-management policy is a set of guidelines governing the actions and behavior of all chapters . 
The policy addresses abuse and hazing , alcohol , drugs , high-risk events that expose members , guests or property to injury or damage , and transportation to and from events not held at the chapter house . 
Neither national nor chapter representatives would confirm which section of the policy was violated . 
" We conducted our own investigation and found the chapter had violated many risk management policies , " <PERSON>Biggs</PERSON> said . 
The chapter appealed the suspension , claiming that <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta</ORGANIZATION> Theta nationals did not conduct a " proper and thorough " investigation , but <PERSON>Biggs</PERSON> said the appeal was not granted . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>General Council</ORGANIZATION> did not follow the process in their statutes for proper investigation of a chapter , " chapter President <PERSON>Brendan Dignan</PERSON> said . 
The Council " used double and triple hearsay and never interviewed any of us or alumni " during the investigation . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> investigated the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's Phi Delt chapter in the fall for hazing allegations . 
In a late fall trial , the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> revoked <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta Theta</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Fraternal Organization Agreement</ORGANIZATION> after finding it guilty of violating Standards One and Nine of the <ORGANIZATION>Standards of Conduct</ORGANIZATION> . 
Phi Delt appealed that decision , and the <ORGANIZATION>Judicial Review Board</ORGANIZATION> ruled the sanction was too harsh and instructed the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> and Phi Delt to mediate a new sanction . 
Dignan declined to comment whether a new sanction was agreed on . 
Standard One prohibits physical and sexual assault and <ORGANIZATION>Standard Nine</ORGANIZATION> prohibits violation of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policies or of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> regulations as described in The Record , including regulations concerning the use of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> facilities . 
Phi Delt was convicted by the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> of violating Standard One by depriving pledges of sleep . 
It also was convicted of violating terms of the <ORGANIZATION>FOA</ORGANIZATION> , a Standard Nine violation . 
The FOA is a document that establishes a fraternity 's relationship with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Harry Marshall</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta Theta Housing Corporation</ORGANIZATION> , said he and other alumni stand fully behind the current brothers and leadership in the house . 
" Myself and the <ORGANIZATION>Housing Corporation</ORGANIZATION> feel very strongly the members of the fraternity are honorable individuals and they should continue as part of the national fraternity , " <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> said . 
Phi <ORGANIZATION>Delta Theta</ORGANIZATION> 's national organization hopes to recolonize the chapter at a later date , <PERSON>Biggs</PERSON> said . 
" We hope someday <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta Theta</ORGANIZATION> will be able to return to establish the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Beta chapter . "
