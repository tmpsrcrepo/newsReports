The Cavalier Daily <PERSON>Jesse</PERSON> " LJ " <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> 's attorney <PERSON>Jim Camblos</PERSON> has requested his client undergo a psychiatric evaluation . 
" There are many mitigating circumstances related to mental illness and diminished responsibility at the time of the offense , but none precludes a death sentence outright , " <PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON> said . 
" However , if he were found to have intellectual disability , a death sentence is precluded . " 
Attorney <PERSON>James Camblos</PERSON> requested a psychiatric evaluation for <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> resident <PERSON>Jesse Matthew Friday</PERSON> in relation to a <DATE>2005</DATE> sexual assault case . 
The evaluation would determine whether <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> is competent to stand trial for the abduction with intent to defile , sexual penetration with an object and attempted capital murder of an unnamed woman in the City of <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sept. 24 , 2005</DATE> . 
According to authorities , the 26 year-old woman was grabbed from behind and assaulted as she was walking home , before a neighbor walked by , startling the assailant and causing him to flee . 
" The suspect grabbed the victim from behind as she walked down Rock Garden Drive toward her residence , " the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement release in <DATE>2012</DATE> . 
" He then carried the victim to a grassy area behind a maintenance shed , where he sexually assaulted her . " 
After the DNA submitted to the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> 's national DNA Database matched DNA found in the investigation into the <DATE>2009</DATE> death of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Tech student <PERSON>Morgan Harrington</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> launched a multimedia campaign to search for the suspect in the <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> sexual assault . 
This DNA was then connected to <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> after he was taken into custody in <DATE>September</DATE> for the abduction of second-year College student <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> - who went missing <DATE>Sept. 13</DATE> and whose remains were found five weeks later . 
<PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> , who is currently being held in the <LOCATION>Albemarle County Regional Jail</LOCATION> , appeared via video link <DATE>Friday</DATE> in the <LOCATION>Fairfax County Courthouse</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Camblos</PERSON> , who is serving as <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> 's attorney for both the <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> cases . 
Fairfax judge <PERSON>Dennis J. Smith</PERSON> , who is in charge of the trial , has not taken any action on the psychiatric request , which has been deferred until the jury has been assigned . 
If <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> is found " incompetent to stand trial , " he will be considered unable to assist in his own defense or make the decisions necessary for his defense , said University Law Prof. <PERSON>Richard J. Bonnie</PERSON> , who specializes in psychiatry and public policy . 
<PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON> said a psychiatric evaluation could lead to three possible outcomes , depending on whether or not <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> is found insane at the time of the trial , at the time of the offense or in general . 
If <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> 's sanity comes into question during the trial , he could be found incompetent for trial . 
He would then be committed for treatment in a facility until he was found able to stand trial . 
The evaluation could delay the trial , allowing the defense to gather more evidence while <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> receives treatment . 
The evaluation could also affect sentencing if <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> is found guilty . 
If the evaluation determines <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> was insane at the time of the offense , he would be committed to a secure mental institution instead of facing jail time . 
Matthew 's mental state and intellectual capacity would also hold weight if he is convicted of a capital offense , with a guilty verdict of " attempted capital murder " carrying the potential for capital punishment . 
" There are many mitigating circumstances related to mental illness and diminished responsibility at the time of the offense , but none precludes a death sentence outright , " <PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON> said . 
" However , if he were found to have intellectual disability , a death sentence is precluded . " 
<PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON> said that thus far , <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> has not shown signs of possible mental illness . 
" There has been nothing in the press accounts of this case that have yet indicated any concern about serious mental illness , " <PERSON>Bonnie</PERSON> said . 
All of <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> 's trials have been postponed until <DATE>December</DATE> , as requested by Camblos .
