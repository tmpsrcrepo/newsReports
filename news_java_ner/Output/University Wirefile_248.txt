From reading the news in various weeks , one thing is clear : U.Va . 
has a problem with sexual assault . 
From the silent protest to the slightly sensational article in the Hook , many different people have been decrying the status quo with sexual assault and how it is dealt with at this university . 
What was not particularly clear from a number of the reported news items , however , was exactly whatthe problem is with how <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> deals with sexual assault . 
From talking with the heads of various advocacy organizations , the general sentiment I received was that the problem can not quite be explained in a simple one-sentence diagnosis . 
It seems as though some survivors of assault feel as though the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has not done an adequate job of dealing with the offenders . 
There have been calls for a single sanction-type policy or sentencing guidelines for people who are convicted of rape . 
However , a two-pronged solution appears to be necessary : Those equipped with dealing with all aspects of sexual assault must receive more education , and the system must have some degree of accountability to the public . 
These changes must be enacted to ensure a balance exists between the rights of the accuser and the accused . 
According to <PERSON>Vicky Long</PERSON> , who organized the silent protest <DATE>several weeks ago</DATE> , <PERCENT>83 percent</PERCENT> of the reported cases of sexual assault at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> are cases known as acquaintance rape , in which the victim knows his or her attacker beforehand . 
Alcohol is usually involved . 
These two factors combine to make it extremely difficult to prosecute such an offense in the criminal justice system . 
One 's first reaction may be to simply dismiss such attacks which can not be criminally prosecuted , however , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has a distinct obligation to its students to hold them to a standard of conduct higher than the rest of society , much like with the honor code . 
As such , an offense that may not be prosecutable in the criminal system may still hold implications for life at this university . 
It is precisely this issue that makes suggesting changes to the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> so difficult . 
Can we really advocate mandatory expulsion for a student accused of rape who would never be found guilty in a court of law ? 
Yet , must we force a victim of sexual assault to face the fact that their attacker is still walking around Grounds ? 
Striking the balance between these extremes is of the utmost importance . 
Thus we must be exceptionally careful in suggesting the changes . 
Realistically speaking , the only time we can approach something such as a single sanction for rape is if a student is found criminally guilty . 
As horrible as a crime sexual assault is , if there is not enough evidence to convict a student beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law , we can not simply automatically remove them from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Sentencing guidelines are also hard to define as each situation is different , yet expulsion should remain as an option available to the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> . 
We have determined that the system needs to be changed because the victims are not feeling that justice has been served . 
We have determined that <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has a compelling interest to enforce standards of behavior , even if that means punishing students who would not have been accused in a court of law . 
But that fundamental problem remains -- in order to accomplish this , we must empower a group of people who are not publicly accountable for their decisions to determine guilt or innocence and appropriate punishment . 
The members of the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> are quite aware of this fine line that they must walk when determining guilt or innocence , and that may have been one of the causes of the somewhat lax sentences for convicted students over the past five years . 
Privacy rules were put into place to protect the accused , the accuser and <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Nevertheless , opening up the system more will allow actually allow more flexibility in sentencing . 
The case for more transparency in the system has already been compellingly made on these very pages , so it is unnecessary to elaborate much further , other than to reiterate that transparency , while maintaining a degree of protection for both the accuser and the accused , ensures that the bureaucratic entity is functioning as it should . 
Along with transparency , education is key to solving this problem , but it is important to understand the distinction between the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> and other resources . 
Members of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> should receive more education to deal with evaluating the facts of a rape case . 
They should not , however , be turned into another victims advocacy group . 
Sexual assault is an extremely heinous crime , and if there was some sort of simple solution that could identify the true perpetrators and remove them from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , all would be satisfied . 
But in the absence of such a magical solution , we must work to find a balance between punishing the convicted and protecting the accused against false allegations .
