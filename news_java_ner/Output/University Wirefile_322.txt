<PERSON>William N. Beebe</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>III</ORGANIZATION> , a former <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> student , pleaded guilty to one charge of felonious sexual assault in <LOCATION>Charlottesville District Court</LOCATION> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> . 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> 's proceedings represent the culmination of a protracted ordeal that garnered national attention after <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> alumna <PERSON>Elizabeth Seccuro</PERSON> filed charges in <DATE>January</DATE> against <PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> for an incident in <DATE>1984</DATE> . 
The incident between <PERSON>Seccuro</PERSON> and <PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> occurredwhen they had a sexual encounter at a <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity party in <DATE>1984</DATE> . 
The case was reopened last year after <PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> wrote to Seccuro and apologized for harming her . 
According to Deputy Commonwealth Attorney <PERSON>Claude V. Worrell</PERSON> , II , during the fraternity party , Seccuro imbibed a " lime-colored green punch , " later believed to contain grain alcohol , which inhibited <ORGANIZATION>Seccuro</ORGANIZATION> 's faculties . 
" She reported feeling out of sorts and unsteady , " <PERSON>Worrell</PERSON> said . 
Afterward , <PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> took <PERSON>Seccuro</PERSON> to his room , which is where the sexual assault took place , <PERSON>Worrell</PERSON> said . 
" She was not in any condition to consent to sexual intercourse , " <PERSON>Worrell</PERSON> said , but sexual intercourse did take place . 
After his <DATE>April</DATE> arraignment , <PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> was indicted on one charge of rape and one charge of object penetration ; however , <PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> came to <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> today to accept a lower charge in exchange for a guilty plea and continued cooperation with the police . 
<PERSON>Worrell</PERSON> said felonious sexual assault characterized the encounter between Seccuro and <PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> more accurately than the previous charges because the investigation was not complete at the time of the preliminary hearing . 
<PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> 's defense attorney , <PERSON>Rhonda Quagliana</PERSON> , agreed . 
Felonious sexual assault " more closely approximates the facts of the case , " <PERSON>Quagliana</PERSON> said , adding that factors like youth and alcohol should be considered in the charges . 
<PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> has also agreed to continue helping police as the investigation of the events of that evening proceeds . 
" We believe other sexual assaults may have occurred that might not [ have been committed ] by Mr. <PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> , " <PERSON>Worrell</PERSON> said . 
According to the agreement , <PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> agreed to a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment with the possibility of a reduced sentence contingent on his cooperation with the police investigation . 
If <PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> is sentenced to more than two years , he has the right to a retrial . 
After the proceedings , <PERSON>Seccuro</PERSON> spoke outside the court house and said she was pleased with the outcome . 
" This has been a really long road for my family , " <PERSON>Seccuro</PERSON> said . 
" I think it 's an edifying moment . " 
In light of her experience , <PERSON>Seccuro</PERSON> said she wants to reach out to other victims of sexual assault by opening a surf camp . 
Beebe delivered a prepared statement to the press . 
" Twenty-two years ago I crossed a line in the standards of conduct with Ms. <PERSON>Seccuro</PERSON> , " <PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> said . 
" I regretted it immediately . " 
In his speech , <PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> said he only wanted to bring closure to the situation . 
" My only purpose in contacting her was to bring peace to both our lives , " <PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> said . 
" Twenty-two years ago I harmed another person , and I have tried to set that right . " 
Beebe is scheduled to be sentenced <DATE>March 15</DATE> .
