<PERSON>Emanuel Brown</PERSON> , a contracted <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employee , died in a men 's restroom in the basement of <ORGANIZATION>New Cabell Hall</ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago . 
If you 're like me , you probably missed this event - and there have been only two short mentions in this newspaper since . 
We certainly do not need the burden of another tragedy at this point in the semester , but Mr. <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> 's death - one quite literally at the center of our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> - deserves more attention . 
In light of recent events , we confront the question : who is included in our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , and why has n't Mr. <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> 's death been given more attention ? 
First , I offer an excerpt from the 61-year-old 's obituary , as posted in The Daily Progress : " <PERSON>Emanuel</PERSON> was a very devoted member of <ORGANIZATION>Covenant Church</ORGANIZATION> where he has served as an Elder for 10 years . 
For the past three years , he served as the First Chair Elder or lay leader for the Elder body . 
He also served on the board for the <ORGANIZATION>Hope Community Center</ORGANIZATION> since its inception in <DATE>1998</DATE> . 
A devout Christian , <PERSON>Emanuel</PERSON> was known for counseling and leading souls to the Lord , and providing comfort in their darkest hours . 
Emanuel touched a countless number of lives in the church as well as in the <LOCATION>Charlottesville/Albemarle County</LOCATION> community . 
In addition to his work in the church and community , <PERSON>Emanuel</PERSON> was the owner of <ORGANIZATION>Brown 's Cleaning Service</ORGANIZATION> , a business he built and worked alongside with his wife <PERSON>Janice</PERSON> . 
He was well respected for his hard work by his customers and his employees . 
Prior to opening his own business , <PERSON>Emanuel</PERSON> worked at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> as a <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Supervisor</ORGANIZATION> for nine years . 
He was also an avid sports fan and supporter of <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> Athletics ... " This was a man who contributed to and cared for both our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community and the larger <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> one - but , as a contracted employee , does he count as a member of our beloved " community ? " 
The social theory scholar <PERSON>Paul James</PERSON> defines community broadly : " a group or network of persons who are connected ( objectively ) to each other by relatively durable social relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties , and who mutually define that relationship ( subjectively ) as important to their social identity and social practice . " 
Less formally , we might define a community as a group of individuals who are consistently engaged with <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> in some capacity . 
In a similar vein , perhaps simply being either a student , volunteer , or someone hired by this university makes you a member . 
I do not know how Mr. <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> personally felt about this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , but under any of these definitions , his history suggests he was indeed a member of <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> community . 
Recently , there has been much talk about what constitutes our " community . " 
In response to tragedies involving students , we 've held vigils and protests ; we 've written articles , chalked the sidewalks , and even spray-painted . 
A death of a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employee in <ORGANIZATION>New Cabell Hall</ORGANIZATION> sounds shocking , so why did no one notice ? 
There are several reasons that might explain the lack of attention , though they do not justify it . 
Was it the timing ? 
In the wake of <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> 's murder and <PERSON>Connor Cormier</PERSON> 's suicide , Mr. <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> 's death occurred during a time of widespread emotional exhaustion . 
Much has taken place since Mr. <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> 's death , too , including the explosive reaction to Rolling Stone 's article on sexual assault at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , as well as the suicide of <PERSON>Peter D'Agostino</PERSON> . 
Some might also say - in a futile task of ranking and comparing tragedies - that Mr. <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> 's death does not have the tragic impact of the other events this semester : he died of medical causes at the mature age of 61 . 
Further , perhaps twenty-somethings might be less inclined to identify with someone old enough to be their grandfather . 
Still this does n't quite explain the lack of response either , for if a professor 's body were to be found in <LOCATION>New Cabell</LOCATION> , surely a different reaction would take place . 
It seems most likely to be Mr. <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> 's role in this community - as a contracted worker who cleaned our facilities - that denies him our community 's attention . 
Last year 's homicide of <PERSON>Jarvis Brown</PERSON> , a 22 year-old O'Hill Dining Hall employee , comes to mind . 
His death received a largely mixed and muted reaction among students , and this newspaper 's editorial identified two reasons for this : a deficiency in student empathy and a perceived divide between students and workers . 
These same two problems , I believe , are responsible for the reaction to <ORGANIZATION>Emanuel Brown</ORGANIZATION> 's passing . 
For as much as we talk about " community , " there are a number of conditions that come with receiving the social rites of a full mourning . 
We love to fawn over Ms. <PERSON>Kathy</PERSON> or crack a ( mostly ) good-humored joke about " Double Swipe " Dean , but the majority of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employees are nameless and faceless . 
Our attention betrays that , in a number of ways , we do n't really feel as though these essential members of our community are members at all . 
As we mourn the deaths of <LOCATION>Hannah</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Connor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> , and grapple with our responsibilities toward our community 's sexual assault survivors , we must also remember <PERSON>Emanuel Brown</PERSON> .
