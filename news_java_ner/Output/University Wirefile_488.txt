The <ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> has reconfigured a subcommittee on sexual misconduct in an effort to participate more in the University-wide effort to prevent and spread awareness about sexual assault . 
Though sexual misconduct is a violation of the 12 standards of conduct which fall under <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> 's jurisdiction , <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> does not actually adjudicate cases of sexual misconduct . 
Federal guidelines recommend colleges have a separate body oversee these cases . 
The role of the subcommittee , then , will be to work with other organizations on Grounds who are already involved with sexual violence prevention work . 
UJC Chair <PERSON>Timothy Kimble</PERSON> said the subcommittee 's direction is not yet defined . 
Perhaps the direction will become clearer once the leaders are selected . 
At this early stage of its development , one can only speculate about the potential accomplishments of this <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee . 
Similar to the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> , the student organization has demonstrated a desire to find solutions to a pervasive problem , the cases of which do not - and can not - actually fall under their jurisdiction . 
But there are ways of participating in the effort beyond that . 
One possible role could be assisting in University-wide education efforts , both about the procedures of sexual misconduct cases at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> and what it means to abide by the 12 standards of conduct . 
Just as Honor has attempted to adopt a dual role of both an adjudicator and an advocacy group for encouraging honorable behavior , <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> could incorporate sexual misconduct education into its attempt to promote a culture of respect . 
Additionally , it is essential for students to know exactly what constitutes a violation of these standards . 
A recent survey conducted at <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> revealed that many students did not know how to define sexual assault . 
There was a significant discrepancy between the number of students who said they had experienced various forms of unwanted sexual contact and the number of students who answered " yes " when explicitly asked if they had been raped or sexually assaulted . 
If there is a lack of understanding from the victims about what constitutes a violation , there conceivably could be a lack of understanding from perpetrators , or other members of the community . 
Closing this gap in knowledge could influence conduct and influence the student responses when survivors confide in their peers about their experiences , creating a culture of greater support . 
Another potential role of this subcommittee could be working with <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> officials to examine data after they conduct their own climate survey . 
Comparisons between the incidence of sexual misconduct and other infractions over which <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> has jurisdiction could be helpful in assessing the gravity of the situation at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The goal of the Hoos Got Your Back campaign is to involve everyone at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , and <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> has taken an initiative to do its part in this campaign . 
Many student groups have been working tirelessly on this issue , because many hands make light work . 
Make no mistake - this work is heavy . 
But with even more students carrying the weight together , the burden will hopefully soon be alleviated .
