<PERSON>John Pappas</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily Commonwealth Lt. Governor <PERSON>Ralph Northam</PERSON> spoke with student leaders in Pavilion V on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> . 
Commonwealth Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Ralph Northam</PERSON> held a meeting with student leaders <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to discuss problems on Grounds which included sexual assault , the recent violent arrest by <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> officers , the state drinking age and the new affordable excellence model . 
<PERSON>Northam</PERSON> said he wanted to hold the meeting to get the chance to hear from the people experiencing many of these issues at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" There have been some issues with the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> and sexual assault on campus and the high cost of higher education , " <PERSON>Northam</PERSON> said . 
" I like to come and talk to the students that are experiencing these different issues and hear their thoughts . " 
He asked Student Council President <PERSON>Abe Axler</PERSON> , a second-year College student , to put this meeting together with students on Grounds . 
<PERSON>Axler</PERSON> said it was helpful to have an opportunity to voice concerns to the lieutenant governor . 
" What I always appreciate is when people come and ask us our opinion , " <PERSON>Axler</PERSON> said . 
" This shows the commitment of the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> executive branch to communicate with U.Va students . " 
Among those who participated in the discussion was third-year College student <PERSON>Melanie Witten</PERSON> , the coordinating chair of <ORGANIZATION>United for Undergraduate Socioeconomic Diversity</ORGANIZATION> . 
In the leadup to the meeting , <PERSON>Witten</PERSON> said she hoped to talk to the lieutenant governor about her ideas concerning the affordable excellence model . 
" As a representative for UFUSED , I will present both the possible merits and the possible challenges this new model may pose , " <PERSON>Witten</PERSON> said in an email . 
" There are many factors that will go into the success or failure of the plan , thus it is difficult to cast a completely positive or negative judgment on the impact this model will have . 
We have quite a few concerns and we really think there may be some better solutions . " 
Northam began the meeting by talking about the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's new tuition model for its Affordable Excellence program . 
He said all kinds of diversity are important for a university , and further that he believes that if an institution can lower the cost of education the school is likely to have greater diversity . 
" We first started to talk about the high cost of education and we all agree that there should be more support to better fund institutions of higher learning , " <PERSON>Northam</PERSON> said . 
" What makes a college or university strong is to have a diverse group of students . 
A lower cost of education would increase the diversity of students . " 
However , <PERSON>Northam</PERSON> said that as a representative of the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> government , his main role in this meeting was to listen to the students and to understand their experiences . 
" I represent the commonwealth so I am a listener , " <PERSON>Northam</PERSON> said . 
" My goal was to come and listen to the students goals and concerns . 
To talk about sexual assault and the students interaction with <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> is important to me . 
Our main message is in the way I ended the meeting . 
I admire the students so much because you are smart and articulate and have great ideas . 
We need to hear these ideas because we as your representatives work for you . " 
<PERSON>Witten</PERSON> said students at the meeting were able to discuss socioeconomic issues at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> with the <PERSON>Northam</PERSON> . 
" We talked in great detail about Affordable Excellence and the peril of low income students at U.Va , " <PERSON>Witten</PERSON> said . 
" There were concerns about people who are just above the middle income threshold who may still be unable to afford college but would not qualify for AccessUVa . 
[ <PERSON>Axler</PERSON> ] voiced his concern , and I concur , that low income students have a very different experience at UVa , which should be addressed . " 
<PERSON>Witten</PERSON> also said the forum to talk about the issues of this year were necessary and that she felt <PERSON>Northam</PERSON> was helpful . 
" He seemed to understand the frustrations students have when attempting to change policies and precedents at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and statewide , " <PERSON>Witten</PERSON> said . 
" Although it should not have taken this long to deal with the issues we 've had <DATE>this year</DATE> , perhaps we can use them as a catalyst for change . 
He recommended that we keep constant pressure on our state legislatures to create change for a better , more inclusive higher education environment . " 
<PERSON>Northam</PERSON> said his ultimate goal was to have a better understanding of students across <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , something which would allow him to work with the governor to make the state 's education system stronger . 
<PERSON>Axler</PERSON> said the meeting brought together many different issues and parts of the <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> , but that the meeting was just the start of larger conversation . 
" The meeting brought together a lot of the facets of student council to talk about issues that <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> students care about , " <PERSON>Axler</PERSON> said . 
" The meeting was a beginning of a conversation . "
