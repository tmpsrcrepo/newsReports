With President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> 's signature on the new Higher Education Act , the federal government has taken new measures to ensure campus safety -- specifically affecting crime reporting and disciplinary procedures at universities . 
" Students will be more aware of the community around them and will able to make informed decisions " with the passing of the <ORGANIZATION>HEA</ORGANIZATION> , said <PERSON>Daniel Carter</PERSON> , vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Security on Campus , Inc.</ORGANIZATION> , a national lobbyist group concerned with campus safety issues . 
New HEA measures also require universities to report all crimes on and off campus to the general public , including hate crimes occurring on or near campuses . 
On the new crime reports , police must identify hate crimes and categorize them as such . 
The reports also must include two additional crime categories not previously required : manslaughter and arson . 
These reports will be divided between crimes that occurred on campus and crimes committed off campus . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Mike Sheffield</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> will be able to comply with the changes . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has been reporting crime statistics to the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> since the early <DATE>1970s</DATE> , " <PERSON>Sheffield</PERSON> said .

<ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> also will be required to submit an annual report of all alcohol and drug related offenses to the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> . 
The DOE then will compile the lists and make a national report on schools ' alcohol and drug statistics . 
In addition , they now are required to have an open-campus police log that details all reported crimes , excepting ongoing investigations . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> already maintain such a log , <PERSON>Sheffield</PERSON> said . 
Colleges and universities will face strict penalties if they misrepresent crime statistics . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is pleased to help provide the larger picture " to its students and the public , <ORGANIZATION>Assoc. Dean of Students V. Shamim Sisson</ORGANIZATION> said . 
But some students have expressed concerns with the changes . 
" Students wo n't know what exactly is on campus and what is not , " said <PERSON>Jaime Pueschel</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>United States Student Association</ORGANIZATION> legislative director . 
According to <PERSON>Dustin Burke</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Facts Education</ORGANIZATION> president , the new act " will give students access to a more complete picture concerning safety in and around the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . " 
The bill also will provide <MONEY>$ 10 million</MONEY> , to be distributed by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Justice</ORGANIZATION> , to help increase protection of women on campus . 
Additionally , the act will include <MONEY>$ 1 million</MONEY> to fund a study about how colleges handle sexual assault accusations . 
Block grants also will be used to help combat binge drinking .
