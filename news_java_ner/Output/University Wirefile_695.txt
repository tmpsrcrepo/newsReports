Third-year <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> student Faith <PERSON>Lyons</PERSON> was initiated into <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta</ORGANIZATION> Theta fraternity in an expedited ceremony <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> following her election as Honor Chair for the 2015-16 term . 
Affording Honor chairs the privilege to join <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta Theta</ORGANIZATION> 's sacred brotherhood is recognized as one of the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> 's most cherished traditions . 
" Welcome - and you 're welcome , " outgoing Honor Chair <PERSON>Nick Hine</PERSON> told <PERSON>Lyons</PERSON> after a brief chapter meeting , which included a brief convening of all 27 undergraduate scholarship selection committees , a candle-passing service to honor the fraternity 's founding matriarch - <PERSON>Pat Lampkin</PERSON> , vice president of student affairs - and some Seven Society stuff just to be efficient . 
<ORGANIZATION>Former Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> student representative <PERSON>Meg Gould</PERSON> , a brother of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta Theta</ORGANIZATION> , said that <PERSON>Lyons</PERSON> would be a perfect fit for the fraternity . 
" She 's white , " <PERSON>Gould</PERSON> said . 
" And Honor chair . " 
<PERSON>Lyons</PERSON> will be presented to the community as an official brother this <DATE>Friday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Roundtable</ORGANIZATION> , an annual event co-hosted by <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta</ORGANIZATION> Theta fraternity , the <ORGANIZATION>Majority Rights Coalition</ORGANIZATION> and that one guy in your Spanish class who gives a shit . 
" I 'm so excited , " <PERSON>Lyons</PERSON> said . 
" I 've quit all my other extracurriculars to focus on Honor - and by virtue of Honor , <LOCATION>Phi Delt</LOCATION> . 
I will almost definitely be really committed-ish to those two things . 
That 's what being a student leader is all about . " 
Since Phi Delt was founded at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1873</DATE> , the fraternity and the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> have found they can connect over that fact that their members just wo n't stop being accepted into all-male sexual assault education group One in Four . 
" Honor is a lived experience , " <PERSON>Hine</PERSON> said , repeating a line he heard former Phi Delt Honor Chair <PERSON>Evan Behrle</PERSON> repeat from former Phi Delt Honor Chair <PERSON>Stephen Nash</PERSON> . 
" That is n't what you asked , is it ? " 
A source close to <PERSON>Lyons</PERSON> said that she is currently under significant pressure from the fraternity to quit the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce School</ORGANIZATION> and declare a major in Political and Social Thought - an interdisciplinary major which would give her more face time with first-year students , whose gossip about how the Honor chair is " really hot , even if it 's just a power thing " is the preeminent way Honor maintains its continued relevance on Grounds . 
When pushed on <PERSON>Lyons</PERSON> ' qualifications for Honor chair , <PERSON>Hine</PERSON> said Honor is a " lived experience . 
Did I already say that ? " 
At press time , <ORGANIZATION>Beta Theta Pi</ORGANIZATION> said the group was " pretty bummed they got her " and " does n't know why this keeps happening . "
