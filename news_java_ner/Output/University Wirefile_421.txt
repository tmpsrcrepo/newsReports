At its <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> meeting , just weeks after the newest executive committee was sworn in , <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> passed a landmark resolution in regards to sexual misconduct at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The Sexual Misconduct Awareness , Recovery , and Tangible resolution , or SMART , offers proposals to raise awareness and offer resources to survivors by working with both student groups and <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administrators . 
Seven clauses outline changes to student education , involvement and administrative action . 
" The ultimate goal here is to put sexual assault on the map , " said <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Jalen Ross</PERSON> , a third-year Engineering student . 
" The perfect world is one in which we do n't have to have a special sexual misconduct policy on Grounds . 
That is the only way to continue with the community of trust , and that is the ultimate goal . 
So we need to figure out what tangible steps we can take right now to get closer to that . " 
A SpeakUpUVa petition posted in late <DATE>January</DATE> of this semester by third-year College student <PERSON>Amy Miller</PERSON> prompted the drafting of the resolution . 
Miller 's petition called for sexual misconduct to be considered an honor code offense . 
According <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> , this is not the first time the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has seen this suggestion . 
" We talked to the administrators who have been around here long enough to realize that essentially every six months , making sexual assault an honor offense comes up again , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said . 
These requests are typically met with some level of dismissal , as the Honor committee requires a higher standard of proof than the law allows in cases of sexual misconduct . 
" What was frustrating to me and the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> is that the conversation always ended there , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said . 
" As Student Council , it 's our duty to give a voice to concerns that we 've heard from a lot of people about sexual assault policy . " 
Members of the <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> drafted the SMART resolution through consultation with groups involved in sexual violence awareness , including One Less , Take Back the Night and the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> . 
" It 's been an effort of everyone on <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said . 
" A lot of us have worked really hard crafting the language after discussing ideas and getting representatives from every sort of sexual assault group at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , so it 's really been sort of a group effort . " 
The first two clauses of the resolution call for student and <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employee training in bystander intervention and victim counseling . 
Student organizations such as One Less and One in Four currently offer bystander intervention education programs , and <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> plans to work with them to create a more central and organized solution . 
" Last fall [ the Class of <DATE>2017</DATE> ] went to [ <PERSON>John Paul Jones</PERSON> Arena ] and listened to a speaker talk about this , and it was n't as effective , " said <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON>Catalina Pinto</PERSON> , a first-year College student . 
" You have 3,500 first-year students and you 're in a big room , so it 's not really as effective as it could be . " 
Student Council also intends to find a way to make training for <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employees , who are considered " mandated reporters , " more organized and increasingly involve student participation . 
The next three clauses of the resolution outline student understanding and involvement in the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> . 
The resolution calls for updates on the number and types of cases that are referred to the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> , similar to summaries released by the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Honor is trying to take out all identifying information , and that 's what we 're trying to do , but we have to be very careful that it is anonymous and ensured that it 's done in an appropriate manner , " <PERSON>Pinto</PERSON> said . 
SMART also proposes increased transparency in the election and appointment of <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> members , possibly making a list of members and contact information available to the student body . 
" We have student self-governance for a reason , so we want to make sure that they got there through a solid process , " <PERSON>Pinto</PERSON> said . 
" A lot of people do n't really like the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> because of their process . 
We 're trying to make sure that everyone at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> understands what the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> does . " 
The resolution suggests a student survey be conducted to gauge the prevalence of sexual misconduct and presses the Office of the Dean of Students to better inform survivors about available resources following an assault . 
" We want people to know that when a victim goes into the Office of the Dean of Students , they are encouraged to contact various resources , [ but ] they by no means have to do it , " <PERSON>Pinto</PERSON> said . 
A <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Prevention Coordinator</ORGANIZATION> , currently being sought out , would offer another resource to students outside of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I do n't think [ SMART ] is necessarily going to solve the problem , but it can help us improve both our policy and promotion efforts , " said Associate Dean of Students <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> , who chairs the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> . 
The resolution provides some outline regarding the role of <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> , administrators and other organizations in preventing sexual misconduct , but the execution of the changes is still being discussed . 
" The bill calls for [ change ] , but it does n't lay out exactly how its going to happen , so its going to be our job in the next couple of months to figure out exactly what that 's going to look like , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said . 
Student Council expects the resolution to be in full swing for the 2014-15 school year . 
" Resolutions do n't do anyone any good if they 're just words on paper and they never happen , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said . 
" Certainly by this time next year , and hopefully by the <DATE>fall</DATE> , we will [ have ] made those concrete changes , and the sexual misconduct policy of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is better for it . "
