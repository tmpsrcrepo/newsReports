Dante wrote that " the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in times of great moral crisis maintained their neutrality . " 
This is the quote that drapes the Web site of the <ORGANIZATION>Minority Rights Coalition</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Well , I will not maintain my neutrality , especially when the Minority Rights Coalition at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and similar organizations across the country are pushing for the Balkanization of this great nation . 
Piggybacking on the honorable work of civil rights activists from the <DATE>1960s</DATE> , they are trying to destroy the melting pot that is <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
Not too long ago there was a nasty practice called " segregation . " 
It was not a good thing , to say the least . 
That is why the <ORGANIZATION>United States Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> , in <ORGANIZATION>Brown v. Board of Education</ORGANIZATION> , outlawed the " separate but equal " form of public education . 
In this case it was decided that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> should follow its motto of " E Pluribus Unum " rather than the tyrannical beliefs of white supremacists who propounded the ridiculous notion that people of different races were somehow unfit to study and live together . 
Thankfully , the courageous efforts of civil rights activists , including <ORGANIZATION>University History</ORGANIZATION> Prof. <PERSON>Julian Bond</PERSON> , persuaded the overwhelming majority of Americans , and slowly segregation became a stigma of the past . 
Segregation is back with a vengeance , but this time it 's being led by self-proclaimed proponents of minority rights . 
A collaborative effort between the <ORGANIZATION>Hetrick-Martin Institute</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>New York City Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> has brought back the ugly demon that once was segregation . 
Their pet monster , the <ORGANIZATION>Harvey Milk School</ORGANIZATION> , is the nation 's first accredited public high school designed to meet the needs of gay , lesbian , bisexual , transgender and questioning youth . 
But in fact , this separatist educational institution divides these students from their peers and places them in the grip of segregated schooling . 
The minority rights coalitions of today unfairly portray their agenda as the logical continuation of the civil rights era . 
The U.Va . 
Minority Rights Coalition Web site draws on the linkages between the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and today . 
Their efforts to continue the fight against vestiges of racism in our society are honorable and should be commended . 
In this fight , the U.Va . 
Minority Rights Coalition should have our support . 
For their part , they would have had the support <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> , as well . 
But the <ORGANIZATION>Minority Rights Coalition</ORGANIZATION> loses its focus in moving the fight from opposing racism to supporting " diversity training . " 
Everyone knows that people have unique qualities and differences . 
There is no need to train people to teach them this . 
Rather , one would want to persuade people to ignore those differences , and to judge their peers on their intrinsic qualities as human beings . 
Stop talking about superficial differences like skin color . 
Start talking about differences of ideas . 
" Diversity training " follows the logic that somehow all Asians , all African Americans , all women , all gays and all minorities are subject to feelings of inferiority and verbal abuse . 
Subjecting groups to labels is unfair . 
Worse still is subjecting groups to different institutions , such as separate schools for each " victimized " segment of society . 
A school for gays . 
A school for fat people . 
A school for really fat people . 
A school for Mexican Americans and a school for Latino Americans . 
A school for everyone who is n't popular . 
The <DATE>1960s</DATE> saw a revolution that equalized an oppressed group of Americans . 
They did not have the rights that any person of a civil society should enjoy . 
They could n't vote or attend the same institution as white people . 
They lacked the basic rights that allow us to go about our daily lives free from harassment by the government . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Civil Rights Movement</ORGANIZATION> secured the rights of minorities to live without fear from an oppressive government . 
The Civil Rights Movement was never about securing some imaginary right to always feel good about oneself . 
It made everyone equal in front of the law ! 
Dividing <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> into pieces in order to bolster some peoples ' self-esteem is not going to make this country any stronger . 
Quite to the contrary , it 's going to break it apart . 
Out of many , one ! 
One integrated nation , not one divided -- that 's " E Pluribus Unum " for you .
