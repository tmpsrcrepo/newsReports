<PERSON>Jenna Truong</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily Gov. <PERSON>Terry McAuliffe</PERSON> announced his appointments to a task force <DATE>Monday</DATE> which will work to combat sexual violence on <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> campuses . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Dean of Students Allen Groves</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> , a <DATE>2013</DATE> University graduate and project coordinator in the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs , are among 30 appointed members from throughout the commonwealth who will serve on the task force . 
The task force will first convene <DATE>Oct. 9</DATE> and intends to meet quarterly . 
Those selected represent a large cross-section of commonwealth professionals invested in combatting campus sexual assault , and include higher education administrators , forensic nurse examiners and law enforcement officials . 
" The objective , in short form , is to develop the best practices for colleges and universities on preventing and addressing sexual assault , " <PERSON>Groves</PERSON> said . 
" The idea is to bring together subject matter experts in the area to sit around a table and brainstorm on best practices . 
That vehicle seems to me to be very effective . " 
The task force will also include student activists , many of whom are sexual assault survivors themselves . 
" We 're hopefully a blending of student perspective , survivor perspective and federal perspective , " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said . 
" I can at least voice what I see as barriers to student engagement and understanding . " 
Officials designed the task force to craft recommendations to the Governor 's Office on potential legislative or executive action which would improve the way <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's public universities handle cases of sexual assault . 
" Especially important are the prevention strategies , " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said . 
" Just anything that <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> as a whole can be doing to get on the front end of this issue as opposed to kind of triaging the back end . " 
The task force will also allow universities to compare policies with each other and determine what is most effective . 
Beyond the standards set by the federal government , states and universities are at liberty to create their own policies to address sexual violence . 
" It 'll be nice to not only be re-evaluating , but also see how we line up with and get feedback from other universities to see what we could be doing differently , " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said . 
" Something could be compliant [ with federal standards ] , but it may not be good , and I think that 's something we really struggle with at U.Va . " 
The task force will not begin discussing policy until its first meeting . 
<PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said she would support state programs in bystander education , as well as education programs which would begin in secondary school . 
" What we know about perpetrators often is that a lot of the behaviors associated with perpetration - prying people with alcohol , predatory spying and behaviors - those things develop around middle and high school , and really become cemented in college , " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said . 
The Governor will also review current policies related to sexual assault at <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's public universities . 
Groves said he expects changes to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's practices will not be drastic , but will include the important expansion of definitions and some policies of implementation . 
Right now , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> is working to expand its staff dealing with cases of sexual assault . 
" We have posted two positions that will be working out of the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Equal Opportunity Programs</ORGANIZATION> - where the Title IX coordinator is - and those two people will be investigators for these cases , " <PERSON>Groves</PERSON> said . 
" Until now , the investigations were handled by staff out of Vice President [ Pat ] <PERSON>Lampkin</PERSON> 's office . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will also make changes to its policies on sexual assault based on guidance from the federal task force on campus sexual assault , created by President <PERSON>Barack Obama</PERSON> this past <DATE>April</DATE> . 
" We know that we need to make an update as new information is being received from the federal government , " <PERSON>Groves</PERSON> said . 
" There is some additional guidance that came down late last <DATE>spring</DATE> from the federal government , and we are anticipating more guidance sometime this <DATE>fall</DATE> . 
We intend to undertake a review and revision sometime during this academic year . "
