Last week , several events at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> were held to raise awareness about both sexual assault and the resources available to address it . 
A mock sexual assault hearing on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> allowed students to better understand how hearings of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> ( SAB ) are conducted . 
An informal discussion on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> let concerned members of the community come together to address a wide variety of issues relating to sexual assault , from its definition to education and sanctioning . 
These events , while invaluable in encouraging a dialogue about such a pressing issue on college campuses , are only two steps among the many more needed in the ongoing process of reforming the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's judicial system and encouraging educational efforts regarding sexual assault . 
A student survivor of sexual assault has several options for adjudication . 
He or she can pursue criminal or civil charges in the local courts , and University-based routes include an <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> hearing or mediation through the Office of the <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Students</ORGANIZATION> . 
Unfortunately , close to <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of incidents of sexual assault go unreported . 
The reasons why survivors do not report sexual assault are many , but undoubtedly one is the difficulty and perceived lack of justice in prosecuting and punishing the guilty . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Attorneys</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Albemarle County</LOCATION> rarely take up cases of sexual assault , and as the absence of any expulsions or suspensions in the past five years for the crime demonstrate , few students receive the harshest penalties through <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> modes of adjudication . 
The low percentage of reported cases of sexual assault is a symptom of the frequent lack of convincing evidence beyond " he said/she said " testimony . 
Such a dearth can discourage reporting and give prosecutors and the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> very little to go on in pressing charges or issuing punishments . 
The outrage expressed by attendees of the open forum last week centered on the fact that students found guilty of sexual assault can remain at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> while being given lesser sanctions like counseling or other time and place restrictions . 
The system in place , though , does allow for change . 
Amendments in the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> procedures can institute alterations in the sanctions for those found guilty of sexual assault , and that push can come from the students . 
A proposed change would then be voted on by the student body in a referendum . 
Given the apparent consensus that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> does not do enough to punish offenders , the most suitable option for ensuring justice is mandating expulsion for those found guilty of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt . 
The <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> would then have the authority to issue the lesser sanctions for a lower threshold of guilt and , of course , find an accused not guilty . 
No student convicted of sexual assault with a preponderance of evidence should remain at this school , and all punishments should be proportionate to that amount of evidence . 
Unfortunately , alcohol further complicates alleged sexual assault . 
About <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> of sexual assaults involve alcohol , but that by no means should discourage survivors from filing charges or make them feel complicit in what happened . 
Although unlike drunk driving , no bright line like a BAC limit can aid in pressing charges or exacting punishment , this does not mean that students can not be held responsible for their actions . 
The scarcity of evidence and the problem of alcohol point to the strongest possibility for powerful initiative -- education . 
People should know what sexual assault means . 
They should know what behavior crosses the line . 
They should know what resources are available to them . 
Preventative measures that groups like SAFE and One in Four take should be lauded , embraced and expanded by the student body . 
This work can prevent situations from ever reaching the stage of an <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> hearing . 
But if they do , it 's imperative that students realize sexual assault is unacceptable and that both their peers and judges should be able to enforce it .
