<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily For many students , the Rolling Stone saga began <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> , <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE> . 
The article , posted online that morning , prompted a series of protests and meetings , before being thrown under strict scrutiny after a host of discrepancies came to light in <DATE>December</DATE> . 
The narrative was capped in <DATE>mid-January</DATE> , when police said an investigation found no evidence that <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> , the fraternity at the center of the story of an alleged gang rape of then-first-year student <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> , was involved in the incident . 
But for <PERSON>Stephen Scipione</PERSON> , a third-year College student and president of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> , things started months prior . 
A representative from his fraternity 's national organization flew to <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> <DATE>Sept. 17</DATE> - <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> 's 21st birthday . 
In a meeting with chapter leadership , the representative asked about a gang rape allegation - a story he had heard from someone within the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administration . 
" We basically just looked at each other and our mouths were just open , " <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said . 
A follow-up meeting with the chapter 's 65 members went much the same way . 
" You 'd think that one person would maybe look down or not make an emotional face , but no - everybody was just completely , completely in awe , " he said . 
The meeting was the beginning of what would be an unparalleled semester for <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> - one that made their house , a building which towers over Mad Bowl , " the most infamous fraternity house in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , " as <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> puts it . 
The national chapter representative encouraged the fraternity to conduct an internal investigation . 
They did , but with few details about the allegations , there was only so much they could do . 
Bracing themselves for the article 's release , the fraternity worked to implement a series of reforms throughout the semester - limiting parties and going through trainings on sexual assault and bystander intervention . 
" It was frustrating for a lot people - they had done nothing wrong , but they were indirectly being punished , " <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said . 
" But everyone took it very maturely . 
Given the situation , they handled it very , very responsibly - which I 'm proud of . " 
But weeks of planning and investigation did not prepare the fraternity for the onslaught of attention it received once the article spread throughout the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community and permeated national dialogue about rape , college student safety and Greek culture . 
The article 's allegations , <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said , were " 10 times worse than we were ever expecting . " 
He read the story early that <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> . 
The family friend of a fraternity brother had found a printed copy of Rolling Stone at <LOCATION>Barnes</LOCATION> and Noble a few hours before the article was published online . 
" I 'll never forget that morning , " <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said . 
" I was not the first one to read it , but I was watching others read it . 
And it was tough . 
Seeing the look in their eyes . 
Most had to step out of the room to read it . " 
They scanned the article 's pages and sent it out to the fraternity 's listserv - hoping to give brothers time to prepare for the wave of reactions which would overcome the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
<PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said no part of him ever believed the story - he knew there were discrepancies and that <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> could not have been involved . 
But after a meeting with two <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> deans , the chapter decided to voluntarily suspend itself - since a police investigation into the incident , requested by <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> , meant the chapter would not be able to keep its good standing with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We decided that the best plan of action was to voluntarily suspend ourselves - not as a symbolic thing , but it was the right thing to do to cooperate , " he said . 
" And that 's the stance that we 've taken the entire time - cooperating with the school and more importantly with the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> police . " 
For many of the brothers , the ensuing days were hellish . 
Not wearing fraternity T-shirts was a given . 
Anonymous vandals threw a brick through their house 's window and graffitied a wall outside their home with the words , " UVA Center for Rape Studies . " 
Multiple protests took place outside the fraternity house - including one which saw several individuals arrested for trespassing after they refused to leave house 's front steps . 
Many fraternity members - <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> included - stopped going to their classes . 
" A lot of guys did not feel comfortable going to class , especially when you have teachers speaking out against our fraternity , " he said . 
" And you have these students showing these acts of violence on our house - and it was almost like it was condoned , knowing that there had never really been a follow-up on that , at the time . " 
He said he is not expecting an apology from anyone for the way <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> was villainized in the weeks before the discrepancies were made public - though he said he would like to see some " formal recognition " from Rolling Stone . 
" We 're not the victims here , and that 's important to remember , " he said . 
" It was tough for those couple weeks - there 's no denying that . 
But there 's a much bigger story here . " 
Brothers did receive some support - from members of other Greek houses and chapter alumni , along with family and friends . 
But the community , <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said , seemed to be accepting the allegations and the actions of the vandals . 
A police investigation into the vandalism is still ongoing , <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Police Capt. <PERSON>Gary Pleasants</PERSON> said last week . 
Brothers quickly left the house , with only a handful of the 18 choosing to stay behind . 
Most stayed in hotels or on friends ' couches . 
The few who stayed all slept in the same room - " the furthest possible point from any windows or doors , " <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said . 
But even moving and skipping classes could not shield brothers from all the negative attention . 
" I received countless death threats , " <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said . 
" It was tough reading some of the emails I got , I 'll give you that . 
And not knowing what to say . 
It 's tough to see those and not be able to say anything back . " 
Within 24 hours , the fraternity conducted a review of the claims in the article - noting several discrepancies - and handed their documentation to <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police</ORGANIZATION> . 
But they did not release a statement noting the findings until <DATE>Dec. 5</DATE> , when they received the go-ahead from investigators . 
That same day , Rolling Stone released a statement acknowledging there were discrepancies in the story , and the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post published an article which cast doubt on several key aspects of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's reported assault . 
" That was probably the busiest day out of the entire last semester , " <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said . 
" In a good way . 
Guys were happy , but at the same time , it was n't over with . " 
Though the media and public eye quickly turned to a more critical evaluation of the article 's central claims , <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said the relief was only partially satisfying . 
" It was nowhere near an exoneration like it should have been , and most of the brothers had known that information for a long time - it was n't a secret , " he said . 
" But it was nice to get the word out and kind of move the story in a different direction , away from us . 
There 's no denying that it was a relief of some sort , but at the same time we all knew that there was a lot to be done and there 's a lot left in the story . " 
<PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> worked with the <ORGANIZATION>University during Winter Break</ORGANIZATION> to ensure the fraternity 's name could be cleared more formally before the start of fraternity rush - which began <DATE>Jan. 15</DATE> . 
Police officially cleared the fraternity of any involvement <DATE>Jan. 12</DATE> . 
Rush , which finishes up this coming weekend , went decently well for <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> . 
There was a drop-off in the number of students who expressed interest in the fraternity , but <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said he expects to have as strong a pledge class as every other year . 
The fraternity , as a whole , is looking forward to putting last semester behind it and returning to some level of normalcy . 
" It 's going to take some time to get our feet back on the ground , " <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said . 
" Last semester was a pretty big blow for us . 
And a lot of guys are worn out and burnt out and want to return to normal . 
But there is still a lot of work to be done and we can be a big catalyst to that . " 
The fraternity played a big role in the development of the new <ORGANIZATION>Fraternal Organization Agreement</ORGANIZATION> , which all fraternities signed onto at the beginning of the semester . 
The regulations , <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said , will take some time to adjust to , but will ultimately help to make parties safer for students . 
The administration 's decision to ban fraternity social activities in the intermediate time , he said , was understandable given the pressure it was under . 
Though he said he was disappointed in the community 's rush to judgment , there may even be a silver lining in the chaos of the past few months . 
" Nobody should ever be put in that position , " he said . 
" I do n't know why we were . 
I still lose sleep wondering why . 
But everybody has learned from this , and they will move on and they will be strong people . " 
Though it may take some time for a complete routine to business as usual , this semester has been a welcome change of pace for <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> brothers . 
" Living in the house was the first thing that we noticed , " <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said . 
" We 're comfortable , we feel safe . 
We do n't have to worry about the threats , we do n't have to worry about sleeping at night . " 
The organization has not yet decided whether it will pursue any legal action in the coming weeks . 
That dialogue will happen between the chapter members , the national organization , and the fraternity 's housing corporation - but <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said he wants to finish the rush process first . 
" We do not have a game plan as of right now - we 're considering all of our options , " he said . 
Ongoing concerns about damage to their reputation aside , the fraternity is in a strong place moving forward , <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said . 
Brothers are comfortable wearing letters around Grounds , putting their affiliation on their resumes and holding rush events . 
" It 's been a miserable semester for everyone - an unfortunate one - but we survived , came out stronger than we were before , " he said . 
" We 're ready to get through this semester , through rush , get a good pledge class and move on . "
