After countless articles , international news coverage and a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> left on edge , the inquiry into the case of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's alleged rape has finally been suspended . 
Yesterday , <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> police , after conducting an investigation of over 70 individuals , formally halted further work on the case reporting they were " not able to conclude to any substantive degree that an incident that is specific to the facts contained in that [ Rolling Stone ] article occurred " . 
When <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's allegations first came out , The Cavalier Daily was quick to provide their fullest empathy to <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>125th Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> sided with her , students outsiders wrote op-eds abhorring the alleged incident and the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> went into a state of mourning . 
The more shocking article came weeks after the incident when <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> broke the news that the story as portrayed by its author , <PERSON>Sabrina Rubin Erdely</PERSON> , contained factual inconsistencies . 
Slowly , the holes in the story grew wider and wider , with arguments promoting <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's descriptions of the events falling apart . 
Today 's police reports confirm that <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's story was just that : a story . 
Last week 's events on the Corner saw The Cavalier Daily quickly stand for <ORGANIZATION>Martese Johnson</ORGANIZATION> in a similar way to how the previous <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> did for <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> months ago . 
In " We 're here for Martese , " this <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> asserted its position the day after the incident that " Whatever details may surface , a member of our community was hurt . . . in a space where he is supposed to feel safe . " 
Yet such assertions are weak because details in events like this do matter ; details about <ORGANIZATION>Martese</ORGANIZATION> 's behavior with the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control</ORGANIZATION> and the status of his ID are key in understanding what happened that night . 
To wave them off with a simple " whatever " is misleading . 
Although reacting to situations quickly and formulating opinions on the fly are essential in news reporting , hastily taking " stands " on situations where many details are yet to be revealed is bad journalism . 
When the article was published , there were few details known about the incident . 
A much-needed <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily</ORGANIZATION> interview with <ORGANIZATION>Trinity</ORGANIZATION> 's owner only later showed that <PERSON>Martese</PERSON> had been cordial ; it was then revealed that he had n't been belligerently drunk or used a fake ID , though other details still remain hazy . 
Clearly , we can see the incident did not so much stem from <ORGANIZATION>Martese</ORGANIZATION> 's behavior , but rather from overzealous and potentially racist <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> agents . 
Whether the agents were motivated to arrest Martese based on his race is an entirely different story , but it is impossible to know the true intentions and motivations of the officers that night . 
But these important bits of evidence showing <ORGANIZATION>Martese</ORGANIZATION> 's relative innocence were not publicly known when the <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> wrote its article advocating for <ORGANIZATION>Martese</ORGANIZATION> on the <DATE>19th</DATE> . 
In supporting Martese before details were known , the <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> was jumping the gun , pushing out the wishy washy opinion that we should always " put our peers first " when it was still unclear what exactly our peer had done . 
Organizations like Black Dot and and the <ORGANIZATION>Black Student Alliance</ORGANIZATION> also took immediate action in setting up forums and rallies , but their activities are more justifiable considering they are black student groups aimed to offer a community and voice for black students on grounds . 
When individuals from a discriminated minority are brutalized by a law enforcement agency , there is a tendency for minority communities to see such actions as part of the larger framework of discrimination . 
And there is nothing wrong with that , especially considering the very recent contexts of similar police brutality incidents in which race was no doubt a factor . 
Contrast this with the position of The Cavalier Daily , a newspaper whose main job is to report the news and make informed opinions . 
While " We 're here for Martese " was no doubt an opinion piece , it was also written by the <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> , the heart and soul of the newspaper . 
The fact that the article itself mentions the lack of facts , and then proceeds to take a stance anyway , is disheartening , only further proving that the <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> 's reaction was a knee jerk one . 
For strictly news-based reporting , an emphasis on speedy reporting is n't so reprehensible , and The Cavalier Daily staff has done a tremendous job this past year of providing coverage , exclusive interviews and diverse opinions on news that matters to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students . 
But informed opinions should wait to be published , written only after sufficient evidence exists regarding a controversial incident . 
Such evidence was not gathered at the time of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's story , nor was it gathered for " We 're here for Martese " ; I personally " stood with Martese " only after the Trinity interview divulged details of his relative calm . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> is tasked with the difficult duty of publishing daily , so it is understandable that members of it would want to write about the news at hand . 
Still , " We 're here for Martese " is revelatory of the <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> 's propensity to take stands too quickly . 
The best opinions are n't ones that are emotionally fueled or take the popular stand , but the ones supported by details and evidence .
