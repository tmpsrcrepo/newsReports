The <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Student Council</ORGANIZATION> discussed three resolutions <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> , including a proposal to create a new <ORGANIZATION>Certified Independent Organization</ORGANIZATION> to coordinate neighborhood watches in off-Grounds areas where many students live . 
College Rep. <PERSON>Ryan Taylor</PERSON> introduced a resolution to create the <ORGANIZATION>CIO</ORGANIZATION> which would work with other CIOs around Grounds , as well as local police , " to train and coordinate " neighborhood watches within the areas of Barracks-Rugby , <ORGANIZATION>Jefferson Park Avenue</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Lewis Mountain</ORGANIZATION> . 
According to <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> , other neighborhood watches are coordinated by a neighborhood block captain who goes from house to house asking people to participate , but this program will be run by a CIO that will have officers and permanent members who keep the program going , even after the original members have left . 
<PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> said because the program will be run through a CIO , it will have a better chance of lasting through time . 
<LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> , Police Chief <PERSON>Tim Longo</PERSON> said a neighborhood watch was a good idea , but worried about the ability of students to sustain the watch through different cycles of residents . 
" Anytime you are able to pull a neighborhood together and make it into a community , be it within U.Va . 
or outside of it , it is a good thing , " <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> said . 
According to Long , one difficulty that arises with regard to these watches is volunteers ' ability to " sustain the momentum at the same level [ in areas ] where people are constantly matriculating in and out . " 
He explained that while one group of students may be excited and motivated about such a project , it is often difficult to sustain the same level of excitement and motivation when new groups move into an area , replacing people who previously took part in the watch . 
<PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> said the inspiration for the resolution came from the recent sexual assaults on 15th Street and Wertland Street . 
" We wanted a more tangible response other then more blue phones and SafeRide , " <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> said . 
" We wanted to do something that was most cost effective and provided the maximum deterrence . " 
If the resolution passes , the resulting CIO will coordinate university CIOs and <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> police to recruit and train volunteers to form the watches . 
According to <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> , the watches will provide houses where there will " always be a light on outside , always be somewhere safe students know they can go and always have an extra pair of eyes on the road . " 
<PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> said he hoped the program will deter criminals and provide better identification of those who choose to commit crimes . 
<PERSON>Longo</PERSON> said the police department will be available to provide support for any program created . 
Resolutions recommending that <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION> add premium channels such as HBO to student cable services and that <ORGANIZATION>Dining Services</ORGANIZATION> suspend the use of trays at the <ORGANIZATION>Observatory Hill</ORGANIZATION> dining hall during the 2007-2008 school were also discussed . 
Student Council President <PERSON>Darius Nabors</PERSON> proposed the <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION> resolution and remarked that channels available to students living off Grounds should be available to students living on Grounds . 
<PERSON>James Jokl</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION> communications and systems director , said <ORGANIZATION>ITC</ORGANIZATION> was willing to look into the matter , provided a substantial amount of student interest is shown . 
<ORGANIZATION>Nabors</ORGANIZATION> also proposed a resolution to recommend the removal of trays from <ORGANIZATION>Observatory Hill Dining Hall</ORGANIZATION> for the 2007-2008 school year in an effort to phase out the use of trays in dining halls . 
<ORGANIZATION>Nabors</ORGANIZATION> said the removal of trays will help conserve water and reduce the amount of wasted food dining halls produce . 
" It is a minimal cost to create a better environmental consciousness , " <ORGANIZATION>Nabors</ORGANIZATION> said . 
<ORGANIZATION>Nabors</ORGANIZATION> said the proposed resolutions will be voted on at future meetings .
