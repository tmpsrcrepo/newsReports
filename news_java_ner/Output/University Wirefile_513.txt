<PERSON>Sarah MacAdam</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier DailyZoe Toone</ORGANIZATION> | The Cavalier <PERSON>DailyMarshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier DailyZoe Toone</ORGANIZATION> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily University</ORGANIZATION> students hosted a " Slut Walk " <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> to protest rape culture and sexual assault on Grounds . 
Protesters walked from the Amphitheatre , to the Lawn , the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity house , the <ORGANIZATION>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</ORGANIZATION> fraternity house and <PERSON>Brooks Hall</PERSON> , before ending at <ORGANIZATION>Peabody Hall</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Maria Dehart</PERSON> , a first-year College student and one of the main organizers of the event , said that " Slut Walk " movement began in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> , in response to a police officer who addressed rape by advising women not to dress " like sluts . " 
" There was a lot of anger , " <PERSON>Dehart</PERSON> said . " 
[ Slut Walk ] is trying to fight against this victim-blaming , slut-shaming culture we have that sexualizes women , yet shames them for being sexual . 
So we were trying to take the word slut , and the movement tries to turn it around and take the shame out of it . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's culture around sexual assault was thrust into the national spotlight when a Rolling Stone article published <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> detailed several alleged sexual assaults which occurred in recent years . 
The piece 's author , <PERSON>Sabrina Rubin Erdely</PERSON> , said the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is " genteel , " lacking a " radical feminist culture seeking to upend the patriarchy , " and specifically noting the lack of activities such as SlutWalks , regular occurrences at some universities across the country . 
" U.Va . 
is n't an edgy or progressive campus by any stretch , " Erdely wrote in the piece . 
At the Slut Walk <DATE>Friday</DATE> , protesters and survivors of sexual assault spoke at the different stops to share personal experiences and opinions on rape culture at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Protesters chanted , " My dress is not a yes , " " Whose University ? 
Our University , " " One in Four , let 's change the score " and " You ca n't get away with this . " 
First-year College student <PERSON>Meagan Martin</PERSON> attended the protest to express her concern with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administration 's reaction to the article and its methods of handling sexual assault . 
" I really wish it had n't come out in a Rolling Stone article , " <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said , " Other than that , I 'm just really upset with the administration . 
I 'm not trying to scapegoat fraternities or Greek life in any way , and it 's really important that we do n't do that . 
Other than that the administration is the problem . " 
Another first-year College student , who wanted to remain anonymous , said she was concerned members of the student body were worried about the article tarnishing the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's reputation . 
" It irritates me that the student body seems to think it 's an attack on the school , " she said . 
" They should be more worried about the school not doing anything rather than worrying about the reputation of the school being tarnished by things that they have n't done . 
They need to fix that . " 
The last stop of the Slut Walk was <ORGANIZATION>Peabody Hall</ORGANIZATION> , which houses the <ORGANIZATION>Office of the Dean of Students</ORGANIZATION> . 
Dean of <ORGANIZATION>Students Allen Groves</ORGANIZATION> addressed protesters on the steps of <ORGANIZATION>Peabody Hall</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I want to hear what you have to say , I want to listen to all of the students who want to talk to me , " <PERSON>Groves</PERSON> said . 
" I 'm the Dean of Students , meaning my job is to support and protect you . " 
<PERSON>DeHart</PERSON> said she and the other students hoped the Slut Walk would encourage survivors and other concerned students to come out and speak about sexual misconduct at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We 're going to keep on making our opinions public , " <PERSON>DeHart</PERSON> said . 
" Hopefully people will listen to us and we can kind of change the mindset here . " 
At the end of the event , several participants wrote their thoughts on Post-it notes , which they then stuck on the doors of <ORGANIZATION>Peabody Hall</ORGANIZATION> . 
Some of the post-it notes read : " Do n't let us down again , " " I do n't feel protected , " and " People before tradition . "
