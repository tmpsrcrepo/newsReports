<ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Police</ORGANIZATION> are investigating a report that a female <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student was sexually assaulted in the <ORGANIZATION>McCormick Road</ORGANIZATION> residence area early <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> . 
The student reported she had met the assailant late <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> and was acquainted with him at the time of the assault , which occurred at about <TIME>4:14 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE> . 
According to <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Michael Coleman</PERSON> , the victim had attended a party off-Grounds where alcohol was served . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police Chief Michael Sheffield</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment as to whether the victim had been drinking but said alcohol frequently is a factor in incidents of sexual assault by an acquaintance . 
Police declined to release any additional details in the interest of maintaining the victim 's privacy . 
Police rarely receive reports of acquaintance rapes on Grounds . 
However , the actual number of occurrences is believed to be much higher than the number of reports , <ORGANIZATION>Sheffield</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" Rape is the most underreported crime there is , and you 'd see even more date/acquaintance rape not being reported , " <PERSON>Sheffield</PERSON> said . 
Only <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of college students report instances of sexual assault and rape , largely because most of the assaults involve assailants whom the victim knows and is reluctant to prosecute , said <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Education Coordinator</ORGANIZATION> for the Women 's Center . 
" Among college students [ acquaintance rape ] accounts for over <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of sexual assaults , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Sheffield</PERSON> said the distinctions between acquaintance rape and stranger-on-stranger rape are largely superficial . 
" Legally there is no difference between stranger rape and acquaintance rape , " he said . 
" Rape is rape . " 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said the responsibility for ending a sexual encounter is up to the initiator . 
" The instant someone changes their mind from consenting to not consenting and makes that decision clear , the instance can become an assault , " she said .
