BLACK or white . 
Right or wrong . 
Honorable or dishonorable . 
Patriot or traitor . 
With us or against us . 
While some leaders try to construe the world in such absolute terms , in reality most of life is more complex . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> code of ethics may be simple -- do not lie , cheat or steal -- but how this translates into working life can be difficult to understand . 
A college education does not give students as much help in understanding ethics as it should . 
Universities should require all students to study practical ethics and learn to think critically about what they will be doing after graduation . 
Many people who do not enroll in undergraduate or graduate business schools become involved in business nonetheless . 
They will start flower shops , manage franchises or become executives in Fortune 500 companies . 
American universities fail to inculcate ethical business practices into all of their graduates , and this is a serious gap in higher education . 
<PERSON>Deepa Challa</PERSON> , a business major at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> , noted that her classes teach her how to manipulate consumers and move numbers , but do not give lessons about when using this knowledge is inappropriate . 
Students do not have to think about whether they should be creating car-payment plans with unclear terms ; they just learn how to do it . 
We all know lying is wrong , but we do not all know what qualifies as lying . 
Are we lying when we use methods learned in accounting class to make debts harder to see ? 
How about using subliminal suggestions in advertising ? 
Although public discourse has referred negatively to the <ORGANIZATION>Enron</ORGANIZATION> debacle too often -- to the point that merely saying " Enron " has the same effect as drawing a pentagram and invoking Satan -- the corporation 's collapse does highlight the distinction between what is legal and what is ethical . 
It 's possible that <ORGANIZATION>Enron</ORGANIZATION> executives never did anything illegal . 
However , they clearly acted unethically . 
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> can not legislate on every possible action by businesses . 
Companies advertise their efficiency by saying they move " at the speed of business , " not at the speed of government . 
Even if <ORGANIZATION>Enron</ORGANIZATION> escapes criminal liability , its executives have been branded as unethical . 
Such outcomes may be averted by better education . 
Though an ethics class can not make someone an ethical person , it can teach certain modes of thinking . 
<ORGANIZATION>Darden Business School</ORGANIZATION> requires all MBA candidates to take a course in business ethics . 
However , even good business ethics classes do not address all problematic practices . 
For instance , the textbook used at <ORGANIZATION>Darden</ORGANIZATION> covers a wide range of issues , including sexual harassment , the environment and international business , but does not mention corporate financing of political campaigns . 
Giving money to politicians who support policies favorable to a business ' interests appears to be an entirely acceptable business practice . 
Campaign finance reform would not have been necessary had corporate executives been ethical enough to refrain from contributing <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> . 
Maybe executives are not trying to buy public officials . 
Maybe they just like the politicians ' stances on abortion , or the death penalty or some other issue totally unrelated to the corporation 's balance sheet . 
If so , giving money to grassroots organizations devoted to educating voters might be a better way to change the political process . 
At the moment , the present system just looks too quid pro quo -- and the schools are not teaching any better . 
Instead , students graduate and often become business people who treat ethics as a barrier to maximizing profits . 
Yet successful people can be ethical people as well . 
Multibillionaire <PERSON>Warren Buffett</PERSON> is a prime example . 
At a recent <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> conference , he criticized CEOs who attempt to claim ignorance of their company 's practices . 
" We own <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> of some companies and believe me , we can discipline the CEO if he does n't tell us what 's going on " ( " Buffett assails CEOs who claim financial ignorance , " <LOCATION>San Diego Union-Tribune</LOCATION> , <DATE>March 5</DATE> ) . 
Buffett practices what he preaches and has shown that ethics can save a business . 
When <ORGANIZATION>Salomon Brothers</ORGANIZATION> became enmeshed in a <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> scandal in the early <DATE>1990s</DATE> , Buffett cleaned house , replacing management with people who had no involvement in the violations . 
He offered to make whatever reforms the government wanted , including having an <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> enforcement lawyer sit in his office and having Salomon plead guilty to a felony charge ( " Some Lessons For Andersen From Scandal At Salomon , " The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> , <DATE>March 18</DATE> ) . 
Universities arm their graduates with the knowledge and credentials to go far and influence much . 
Like the old posters said , knowledge is power . 
The present state of ethics in business , however , indicates colleges too often give students power without the wisdom to use it well .
