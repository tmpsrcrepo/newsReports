<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily <DATE>Last Friday</DATE> , all 31 of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's fraternities signed a new Fraternal Organization Agreement addendum , agreeing to new safety measures for social events . 
But some students have called into question the stringency of the requirements , which mandate sober brothers at each drink station and at stairs to residential rooms , regulate the types of alcohol present and how it is served , and require guest lists for all social functions . 
At <ORGANIZATION>the University of North Carolina</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Chapel Hill</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>James Madison University</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> , among others , similar safety measures already exist . 
<ORGANIZATION>University of North Carolina</ORGANIZATION> , Chapel Hill The Fraternity and <ORGANIZATION>Sorority Life Alcohol Policy</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>the University of North Carolina</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Chapel Hill</ORGANIZATION> has required security guards and guest lists , along with other safety measures , since <DATE>1997</DATE> . 
<PERSON>Aaron Bachenheimer</PERSON> , the Director of the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life and Community Involvement</ORGANIZATION> at UNC , said these policies , when adhered to , make parties safer . 
" There 's always challenges with policies , " <PERSON>Bachenheimer</PERSON> said . 
" You can create the greatest policy in the world , but policy is only as good as enforcement and accountability . " 
For this reason , he said , education and training about these policies is necessary on an annual basis . 
" Every year we go through a retraining of everyone in our community , to help them understand not only what the policy is but the responsibility for adherence to the policy , " <PERSON>Bachenheimer</PERSON> said . 
At UNC , most of the challenges in regard to alcohol policy lie with enforcement and accountability , not with the policy itself . 
" Most of our policies are verbatim FIPG [ Fraternal Information and <ORGANIZATION>Planning Group</ORGANIZATION> ] national risk management policies , so there would n't be a lot to argue with , " <PERSON>Bachenheimer</PERSON> said . 
" All of our organizations already have a responsibility to adhere to those policies through their own national organizations . " 
Almost all policies at <ORGANIZATION>the University of North Carolina</ORGANIZATION> are very similar to national risk management policy , which existed at the individual chapter level for all Greek life groups since before <DATE>1997</DATE> , when the Fraternity and <ORGANIZATION>Sorority Life Alcohol Policy</ORGANIZATION> was first passed . 
University of <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>College Park The University of Maryland</ORGANIZATION> 's <DATE>2012</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>IFC/PHA Alcohol Management and Social Event Monitoring Policy</ORGANIZATION> requires two sober chapter officers at all events , a guest list of five invites per brother , " visible , easily accessible food located in the main guest area " and visibly displayed non-alcoholic beverages . 
Drinks are received in exchange for tickets from designated bartenders only . 
Additionally , chapters of both fraternities and sororities must participate in sexual assault prevention or relationship violence prevention programs and train all new members in alcohol responsibility and risk management . 
The university also requires dry recruitment events . 
<ORGANIZATION>James Madison University Fraternities</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>James Madison University</ORGANIZATION> are required to have a minimum of six sober brothers at " non-third party vendor events , " with at least one sober member from the organization 's executive board to oversee other designated sober members , according to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's Interfraternity and <ORGANIZATION>Panhellenic Councils Standards Policy</ORGANIZATION> . 
Registered Greek events at <ORGANIZATION>JMU</ORGANIZATION> are required to have non-alcoholic beverages , excluding energy drinks , available and visible at the bar . 
Liquor and wine are prohibited from these events unless permitted by national policy . 
Similar to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's new addendum , beer must be served in its original container . 
This policy also requires each fraternity or sorority president , social chair and risk manager to receive training on proper risk management and to educate other members about university policies before any social event . 
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Tech For Greek events and parties at <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Tech , chapters ' main obligation is to register their event with the university . 
" If they 're having an event that has alcohol at it , they just simply have to let us know that they 're having the event , " Director of Fraternity and Sorority Life <PERSON>Byron Hughes</PERSON> said . 
" We will work with the police department to essentially schedule a walkthrough before an event to make certain that they have taken care of all of the risk management guidelines that they are supposed to adhere to . " 
Only fraternities and sororities located on-campus must register events with the university . 
There is no registration or approval process for Greek chapters either off-campus or without a house . 
" Beyond this , there are no additional requirements other than creating a safe event and abiding with university policy and local laws , " <PERSON>Hughes</PERSON> said . 
He said <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> and its fraternities and sororities have a relationship statement , or a broad statement which dives into specific obligations of both university and national chapters , instead of a signed agreement between every chapter . 
Unlike the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's new FOA addendum , that agreement does not specify policies regarding events or parties . 
It does , however , emphasize compliance with local , state and federal laws as well as university policies .
