Last week , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> unveiled a system for members of the community to report bias incidents via the Web or a list of designated administrators . 
In light of the recent history of threats , harassment and even assaults directed against students on the basis of race and sexual orientation , the " Just Report It " initiative can be a valuable tool for vindicating students ' rights . 
At the same time , like any other centralized reporting system , the database has the potential to threaten civil liberties unless the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> implements safeguards against abuse . 
Civil libertarians get nervous whenever governments or large institutions set up ongoing monitoring systems . 
This is not because they are opposed to the general goals of those programs , but because of the double-edged nature of their methods . 
For example , the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> 's Threat and <ORGANIZATION>Local Observation Notice</ORGANIZATION> program is valuable in thwarting terrorism . 
At the same time , it has also threatened our rights by monitoring dozens of peaceful anti-war groups . 
In the same vein , the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> plays an important role in fighting crime . 
But in the past , the agency also has spied on civil rights leaders like Dr. <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> , Jr . 
Taken to the extreme , centralized monitoring can resemble the <ORGANIZATION>East German Stasi</ORGANIZATION> secret police , which built up voluminous files on almost everyone in the country based on citizen reports . 
People of good faith can agree that bias crimes must be zealously prosecuted and bigotry condemned , but also acknowledge that the " Just Report It " program raises some concerns . 
As an initial matter , the definition of " bias " is inherently standardless , and the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> program intentionally has left it so . 
According to <PERSON>Susan Davis</PERSON> , special assistant to the vice president for student affairs , this is to encourage students to report as many incidents as they can . 
" We want to get [ all reports ] into the system so that we can evaluate [ them ] , " regardless of whether they violate the law or <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> disciplinary policies , <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said in an interview . 
In a pluralistic society where individuals have diverging values and worldviews , it may be impossible to even address bias objectively . 
While we can all agree that racially motivated assault , battery and vandalism are morally wrong and punishable , other cases are less clear-cut . 
What about a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administrator who restricts a discussion group to students of one race because he believes this serves a pedagogical purpose ? 
What about racially exclusive scholarships affiliated with the University?What about race-based student groups , many members of which candidly confess that they prefer not to associate with students of other races ? 
These are not merely hypothetical , but rather pressing concerns at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
One can sincerely claim that these are incidents of bias to the students who are excluded because of their race . 
However , given that these issues are fraught with politics and ideology , the question remains : Should these incidents be reported , and will they be treated seriously ? 
Or will administrators contend that all bias is bad , but some bias is worse than others ? 
The " Just Report It " Web site emphasizes that the program itself " carries no independent sanctioning weight or authority . " 
Thus , arguing over what incidents of " bias " are actionable may seem like a matter of splitting hairs . 
Still , when asked what would be done about debatable incidents , <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> suggested , " We will evaluate whether it makes sense for the dean to have an educational conversation with the student " who is the subject of the report . 
However , one might wonder whether such conversations are truly voluntary or conducted in lieu of punishment . 
If it is the latter , then the definition of " bias " must be clarified , lest students be arbitrarily called into the dean 's office on the basis of anonymous reports ( as the program allows ) for all sorts of incidents , whether legitimate or bogus , whether reported sincerely or in bad faith . 
Left unchecked , the system could escalate out of control and become the basis of an inquisition . 
To paraphrase <PERSON>Joe McCarthy</PERSON> , " Are you now or have you ever been a bigot ? " 
It is unquestionable and unfortunate that deplorable acts of intolerance are perpetrated at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Those acts that violate other students ' rights and materially interfere with their education must be severely punished . 
To that end , the " Just Report It " program can be invaluable , and I sincerely hope that any fears about civil liberties are overwrought , as they often are . 
However , to be on the safe side , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should just be careful with it .
