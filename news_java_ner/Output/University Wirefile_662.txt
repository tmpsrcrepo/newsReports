<PERSON>Mitchell Vaughn</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily Community</ORGANIZATION> members were invited to provide their input in the last of three working groups to consider <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> prevention , response , and Â   culture relating to sexual assault . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Culture Working Group</ORGANIZATION> of the President 's Ad <ORGANIZATION>Hoc Group</ORGANIZATION> met <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to address cultural norms and issues surrounding sexual assault at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The town hall style meeting was the final component of a three-day series intended to address safety on Grounds . 
The three working groups - prevention , response and culture - will present their final suggestions to the Ad Hoc Committee <DATE>March 25</DATE> . 
President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> created the Ad <ORGANIZATION>Hoc Committee</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>December</DATE> following the release of a Rolling Stone article detailing the alleged gang rape of a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student in <DATE>2012</DATE> . 
The purpose of the <ORGANIZATION>Culture Working Group</ORGANIZATION> is " to explore the topic of culture and to consider what steps the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> might reasonably take to improve its culture , " said culture working group chair <PERSON>Sharon Hostler</PERSON> , a senior associate dean for <ORGANIZATION>the Medical School</ORGANIZATION> . 
Charlottesville community member <PERSON>Susan Rives</PERSON> , the parent of a current <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student , said a change in culture must primarily take victims into account . " 
[ The ] biggest concern [ is that ] victims do n't believe that they will be believed , " <PERSON>Rives</PERSON> said . 
" They are in shock and want to [ normalize the incident ] , and they believe that the culture here will not believe them so they will not speak about it . " 
Attendees voiced concerns including the first year transition process , community inclusivity , gender and sexual identity objectification , bystander intervention and alcohol abuse . 
First years ' transition into college life was continually stressed as an area of concern . 
The working group discussed ways to help first years feel integrated into the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
Second-year College student <PERSON>Brittany Brown</PERSON> said she is interested in first year students ' initial impression of Grounds . " 
[ The ] culture seen by [ first-year ] students that minute they walk on Grounds ... [ and ] the first impacts they have [ are key ] , '' she said . 
" I hope that at some point in the future we can have a large group of first years to tell us [ good things ] they saw when they came to Grounds this past <DATE>August</DATE> . " 
Architecture Assoc. Prof. <PERSON>Sanda Iliescu</PERSON> said first-year students need to feel integrated with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> in a multitude of settings . 
" The need for first-year students to feel integrated with ... upperclassmen [ extends ] beyond just living and eating [ arrangements to ] extracurricular activities as well , " <PERSON>Iliescu</PERSON> said . 
Iliescu went on to relate student frustration with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administration 's inaccurate portrayal of a divide between students involved and not involved in Greek life . 
" Our students expressed unhappiness and frustration with the administration in that often students are being perceived as [ either ] belonging to Greek life or to being a student at <LOCATION>U.Va.</LOCATION> , [ as if ] there is supposedly a separation or a divide between students who are a part of Greek life and those who are not , " <PERSON>Iliescu</PERSON> said . 
" We need to make an effort as faculty , as members of this staff [ and community ] to remember that we are dealing with students , not Greek students and non-Greek [ students ] . " 
Another cultural component attendees spoke to was the exclusive nature of some <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> organizations . 
<ORGANIZATION>Darden Development</ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON>Christopher Greenwood</PERSON> addressed how the competitive nature of certain groups could be harmful to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> culture . 
" We are seeing a growing schism between traditional student groups , " <PERSON>Greenwood</PERSON> said . 
" Students are applying to get these spots that sometimes can create some sense of elitism . 
How can that exist in the normal everyday work that our students are doing and also how does that cross into the social scene and create itself an elitism socially ? " 
<PERSON>Sophie Trawalter</PERSON> , assistant professor of public policy and psychology , said there is a need for alternative social outlets to Greek life as well as the possibility of discussing regulations within the Greek system that promote gender inequality . 
" It might be time to start conversations [ regarding drinking ] with national chapters of sororities so that women do not have to go to the men to drink , " <PERSON>Trawalter</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Hostler</PERSON> concluded the meeting by reminding the group that their dialogue is a small part of a much larger process of creating cultural change within the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
" This is just the beginning of this process , we have had some rich conversation but it is just the beginning , " <PERSON>Hostler</PERSON> said .
