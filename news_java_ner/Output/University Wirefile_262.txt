A decision is expected <DATE>Friday</DATE> in the <MONEY>$ 1.5 million</MONEY> civil lawsuit <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> alumna <PERSON>Anne Hylton</PERSON> filed against alumnus <PERSON>Matthew Hamilton</PERSON> for an alleged rape that occurred in <DATE>December 2001</DATE> . 
Hylton brought a complaint against <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> to the university 's <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>March 2002</DATE> , according to The Hook . 
<PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> was found to have violated the university 's code of conduct but was not expelled . 
According to <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> 's attorney , Ed <LOCATION>Wayland</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> was approached by <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> on the <TIME>night</TIME> in question , and he offered her three mixed drinks . 
She then started to feel sick and later blacked out . 
Upon regaining consciousness , she found <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> engaging in sexual intercourse with her . 
<LOCATION>Wayland</LOCATION> further said <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> dropped <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> off at her dormitory the next morning , and soon afterwards she went to the emergency room . 
<PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> accused <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> of slipping a date rape drug into one of her drinks and holding her down in bed against her will . 
<PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> 's attorney <PERSON>Doug Weingerder</PERSON> , on the other hand , said the sex was consensual and the accusation being made against his client is the result of <ORGANIZATION>Hylton</ORGANIZATION> 's guilty conscience . 
" She made up this story to justify what she had done , " <PERSON>Weingerder</PERSON> said . 
Weingerder said <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> had sex with <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> because she was drunk rather than drugged . 
Throughout the trial , both sides presented expert testimony in favor of their clients . 
The plaintiff 's expert witness , <PERSON>Eugene Corbett</PERSON> of the university , said <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> had been drugged . 
One of the <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> 's expert witnesses , on the other hand , claimed <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> had consumed five to six ounces of alcohol and could not have lost consciousness . 
The defense 's experts also could not draw any conclusions regarding whether a drug had been used . 
" There is a lack of evidence of a drugged case , " <PERSON>Weingerder</PERSON> said . 
In an attempt to prove her unconscious state resulted from drinking alcohol excessively , Weingerder performed a demonstration to the jury . 
He used a one-ounce shot glass to pour water into a container to help the jury visualize how much alcohol <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> had consumed that night . 
Weingerder also said there was not a single bruise or scrape on <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> 's body to sustain her claim that she was pinned down . 
He further said <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> was offered repeated opportunity to leave , but she chose to stay , change clothes and decided to say " stop " only during the middle of intercourse . 
<LOCATION>Wayland</LOCATION> claimed <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> 's story was fabricated . 
<PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> 's " story makes no sense , " he said . 
<LOCATION>Wayland</LOCATION> asked the jury what reason <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> would have for lying about such a serious allegation . 
" Explain to me why she would have subjected herself four to five hours in the emergency room and why she would have shared her intimate details with several strangers , " he said . 
Weingerder said <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder , explaining her false accusation . 
" She has no recollection of how she got into bed , and she told her sexual assault nurse that she wanted to stop , that he put it away , and then they fell asleep , " he said . 
<LOCATION>Wayland</LOCATION> also told the jury <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> was n't lying for monetary gain . 
" He does n't have <MONEY>$ 1.5 million</MONEY> , so this is a pretty dumb scheme for her to get rich , " he said . 
<LOCATION>Wayland</LOCATION> characterized his client as not being overtly promiscuous . 
Hylton only had only one sexual relationship in the past , he said . 
In his closing remark , <LOCATION>Wayland</LOCATION> emphasized how <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> continued having sex even though <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> told him to stop . 
" The bottom line is that she did not consent , " he said . 
" That 's assault and battery . " 
The testimony finished <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> , and jury deliberations will continue <DATE>Thursday</DATE> .
