A jury is set to deliberate the outcome of <PERSON>Montaret Davis</PERSON> ' trial following the presentation of further evidence today in <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Circuit Court</ORGANIZATION> . 
Davis was arrested <DATE>Oct. 5</DATE> for an <DATE>Aug. 26</DATE> rape and armed robbery . 
Davis is charged with entering a female <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> student 's 17th Street home and raping her while holding her male friend at gunpoint . 
He now stands trial on 16 felony counts including rape , robbery , forcible sodomy and the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony . 
The prosecution continued its presentation of forensic evidence yesterday with the introduction of bed sheets and a beer can taken from the scene of the crime . 
DNA samples of semen and saliva taken from the sheets and the can of beer are what originally led to <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> ' arrest . 
After presenting the alleged victims ' testimonies to the jury <DATE>Monday</DATE> , the prosecution focused yesterday on forensic evidence and attempted to eliminate doubt that any of the materials could have been contaminated . 
The jury , composed of six males , six females and one male alternate , listened to almost two hours of testimony from Detective <PERSON>Robert Lowry</PERSON> and Officer M.R. Bishop of the <LOCATION>Charlottesville Police</LOCATION> detailing the collection of fingerprints and removal of evidence from the scene . 
Both officers identified evidence presented to them by Commonwealth Attorney <PERSON>Dave Chapman</PERSON> and emphasized the procedures used in gathering the items . 
The prosecution also presented a videotape of <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> ' questioning by the police . 
In the tape , <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> repeatedly denied being at the 17th Street residence on the night in question , although the police informed him that collected DNA samples place him at the scene of the crime . 
Defense attorney <PERSON>J. Lloyd Snook III</PERSON> , who said he intends to prove that <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> and the victim had consensual sex as part of a marijuana deal , did not contest the prosecution 's evidence , nor did he introduce a line of questioning consistent with the plan of defense yesterday . 
Following the conclusion of yesterday 's testimony , <PERSON>Snook</PERSON> moved to strike the charge of robbery and lesser-included offenses because of a lack of evidence . 
But the judge ruled the move was premature and needed to wait until all the evidence had been presented . 
Testimony is scheduled to continue <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> . 
<PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said he plans to introduce three more witnesses for the prosecution before the defense asks two witnesses of its own and <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> himself takes the stand .
