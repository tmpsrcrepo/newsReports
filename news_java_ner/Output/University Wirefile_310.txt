Currently , there is no debate about sexual assault . 
Opinion columnists , One In Four and anyone else who puts their mouth behind a megaphone have never actually disagreed about anything . 
Here is the hypothetical " other side " of the sexual assault issue . 
Many writers for The Cavalier Daily have argued over the years that the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> should lower its standard of evidence to find guilty men for rape , sexual assault and sexual misconduct . 
<DATE>March 16 , 2005</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> lowered the standard of evidence from beyond a reasonable doubt to clear and convincing evidence . 
Opinion columnist <PERSON>Marta Cook</PERSON> was not alone when she wrote that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should lower the standard again to a preponderance of evidence . 
A preponderance of evidence is a subjective term that is generally considered to mean " if more evidence points to guilt than not . " 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> criminal justice system requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt for sexual assault ( <ORGANIZATION>Spicer v. Gregoire</ORGANIZATION> ) . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University 's Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> ( SAB ) , however , uses the " clear and convincing standard , " which falls between the two , according to legal authorities . 
The belief that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should lower the standard of evidence even further comes dangerously close to the Napoleonic Code : burden of proof should be placed on the defendant . 
According to <PERSON>Andrew Tuttle</PERSON> , vice president of One In Four , the group 's mission is " to decrease the incidence of rape of sexual assaults and help men get the tools to help a friend or loved one if she is assaulted . " 
This is a laudable goal . 
Even though the group does not take a formal position on this issue , One In Four frequently cites the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> Uniform Crime Report statistic ( <DATE>1995</DATE> ) that false reports of rape occur only <PERCENT>eight percent</PERCENT> of the time . 
The inference I make is they believe men who are accused of sexual assault are very likely guilty and too many get off the hook . 
Therefore , if a man is accused of rape , he is already <PERCENT>92 percent</PERCENT> guilty . 
One In Four 's president , <PERSON>Matt Deasey</PERSON> , agrees that when women actually file a claim of sexual assault , the man is " very likely " to be guilty . 
What kind of culture are we creating ? 
Why do n't we use the <PERCENT>92 percent</PERCENT> guilty type of statistic for other crimes that happen at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> ? 
According to the same Uniform Crime Report , only <PERCENT>24.2 percent</PERCENT> of people across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> who were arrested for aggravated assault were actually convicted . 
According to the <ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> 's Web site , a student can be sanctioned up to and including expulsion for aggravated assault with the " beyond a reasonable doubt " standard . 
At least <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of aggravated assaults at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> do not result in a sanction . 
The injustice ! 
Why do n't we lower that standard too ? 
It is n't like we have n't had the " beyond a reasonable doubt " standard in place for criminal sanctions for centuries . 
Why is sexual assault different ? 
Is it insidious ? 
Sure . 
Harmful ? 
Absolutely . 
A life-long trauma ? 
You bet . 
Some might say that one reason the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should lower the sexual assault standard is because the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> can not put a man in jail . 
The underlying assumption is that the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> 's decision is less harmful than a criminal conviction . 
But , if a man were to be expelled from school under false pretenses , that would : ( 1 ) reduce his education level for jobs to a high school degree , ( 2 ) probably ruin any academic hopes he had , ( 3 ) probably require him to disclose it to any possible employer . 
Is that insidious ? 
Sure . 
Harmful ? 
Absolutely . 
A life-long trauma ? 
You bet . 
Some say that very few men are expelled from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> for sexual assault . 
One opinion column derisively reported that in <DATE>2004</DATE> no person had been expelled from <LOCATION>U.Va</LOCATION> . 
for sexual assault . 
If we do n't expel men in a certain year , should we change the rules to make sure there will be expulsions ? 
Do women feel safer now than they did two years ago ? 
Another frequent proposal is the idea of imposing a single sanction for sexual assault . 
While the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> lets the punishment fit the crime with every other offense save lying , cheating and stealing , many believe we should include sexual assault as well . 
Let me give you an example of why the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> might want to be able show leniency . 
What if there was a male and female at a fraternity party . 
Let us say that they are of equal weight and had the same alcohol tolerance . 
Let us also say they both had the same number of drinks and blacked out and then had sex . 
What if they both woke up in the morning when the woman believes that she had no intention of having sex the previous night ? 
What if she believes that she would never have sex consensually in this circumstance and believes she was raped ? 
Could she file charges with the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> for a rape charge ? 
Sure . 
Could he be convicted ? 
If they had rough sex and the woman had a rape kit performed , than the man would probably be convicted by the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> . 
According to the director of gynecology at <ORGANIZATION>Student Health</ORGANIZATION> , Dr. <PERSON>Christine Peterson</PERSON> , " a rape kit can not prove consent ... rape is a legal definition and not a medical one . " 
According to <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> , rape and consensual sex can be indistinguishable at a medical level . 
So should he be expelled with this kind of evidence ? 
If this example had occurred and the woman did not even believe she was raped but felt uncomfortable enough to file a charge of sexual misconduct against the man with the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> , the man would be probably found guilty . 
Sexual misconduct was defined by <PERSON>Patricia Lampkin</PERSON> , vice president for student affairs , according to a <DATE>spring 2005</DATE> Cavalier Daily article : the act is committed " without intent to harm , " where the offender " by failing to correctly assess the circumstances ... believes unreasonably that effective consent was given . " 
This means , under current guidelines , when there is alcohol involved in this type of situation , even if the woman is supplying it , the man can be held accountable . 
Is this fair ?
