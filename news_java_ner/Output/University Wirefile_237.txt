What began as an e-mail to 15 students calling for a response to the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual assault policy turned into a silent crowd of hundreds of students , faculty and staff gathered on Grounds <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to call for changes in a system that organizers termed inadequate at responding to and preventing sexual assault . 
An estimated 400 students , faculty , staff and community members lined the sidewalk bordering the Amphitheater in a line stretching from the Lawn to the <PERSON>Bryan Hall</PERSON> bridge . 
Demonstrators , some with mouths covered in red and pink cloth , stood in silence from <TIME>11:40 a.m. to 12:05 p.m.</TIME> to symbolize what organizers termed the " silence surrounding rape and sexual assault at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . " 
Event participants gave students copies of a letter addressed to all <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> deans on their way to classes during the demonstration and hand delivered them to deans who could not attend the event . 
In addition to calling for increased education about sexual assault for students , faculty and staff , the letter called for a number of changes to the current sexual assault adjudication procedures including an immediate end to the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> 's confidentiality policy , greater accountability for those who commit acts of rape and sexual assault , increased training in dealing with victims of sexual assault for <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> members and a presidential commission on sexual assault and safety . 
Following a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> decision which held that <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown University</ORGANIZATION> 's confidentiality policies were in violation of federal law , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students likely will voluntarily discontinue its confidentiality policy , <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> Chair <PERSON>Shamim Sisson</PERSON> said . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual assault adjudication procedures are under review this year and administrators have already begun to work on hammering out new policy , <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Students Penny Rue</ORGANIZATION> said . 
In the interest of student self-governance , students should be involved in the reform process , event organizer and third-year College student <PERSON>Vicky Long</PERSON> said . 
" We ask that students are an integral part of that reform and that the reform be transparent to the community , " <PERSON>Long</PERSON> said . 
Though a panel of faculty and staff has already begun drafting new procedures , students will be asked to review proposed changes and may be called on to help revise procedures , <ORGANIZATION>Rue</ORGANIZATION> said . 
In addition to <ORGANIZATION>Rue</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Sisson</PERSON> , administrators currently working on the policy changes include <PERSON>Clare Kaplan</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> sexual assault education officer , and <PERSON>Madelyn Wessel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Susan Davis</PERSON> , special assistants to Vice President for Student Affairs <PERSON>Pat Lampkin</PERSON> . 
The administration will seek to involve students who have the most involvement and familiarity with sexual assault at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , including those students who serve on the sexual assault leadership council and <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> members . 
While <PERSON>Rue</PERSON> said she was pleased to see students voice their opinion on a " difficult " subject , she said she thought the administration 's efforts should be primarily focused on preventing sexual assault . 
" Only students can prevent sexual assault from student to student , " <PERSON>Rue</PERSON> said . 
" Even with every amount of effort we spend working on adjudication procedures we 're really more interested in preventing them . " 
In contrast , <PERSON>Long</PERSON> said she hopes today 's demonstration will put emphasis on the isolation that victims of sexual assault can feel when they are not properly supported . 
" Something had to be done to break the silence , " <PERSON>Long</PERSON> said .
