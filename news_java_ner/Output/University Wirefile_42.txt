Yesterday afternoon students on the steps of <ORGANIZATION>Old Cabell Hall</ORGANIZATION> watched first-year College student <PERSON>Eliane Kim</PERSON> don rubber gloves and an oversized blue space suit from the <ORGANIZATION>University Recycling Center</ORGANIZATION> to fish through a dumpster full of garbage , weeding out potential recylables . 
Kim , a Students for Environmental Activism member , along with SEA President <PERSON>Julie Jones</PERSON> , got her hands dirty as part of Wake Up Week , an annual week-long effort to promote political and social awareness at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We 're incredibly over-consumptive and it 's really started to take its toll , " <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> said . 
" It kind of sucks that we have to harp about the same issue every year . 
But put your trash in the right place , recycle . " 
In addition to <ORGANIZATION>SEA</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Amnesty International</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Mosaic House</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>First Right , Labor Action Group</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>National Organization for Women</ORGANIZATION> , the Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and <ORGANIZATION>Transgender Union</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Critical Mass</ORGANIZATION> and Sexual Assault Facts and Education are participating in events throughout the week . 
Events slated for the rest of week include workshops , panel discussions and a vigil and march for the Living Wage Campaign-an effort devoted to raising the wages of full-time classified workers who start at minimum wage to a more " livable " wage of <MONEY>$ 8</MONEY> per hour . 
" Wake Up Week is a big think tank , a coalition of groups , " said Wake Up Week Director <PERSON>Susan Youssef</PERSON> , a fourth-year College student . 
" Even if the events are n't successful or if the tabling is n't successful , it 's about raising morale and awareness . " 
Activist groups have chalked around Grounds , handed out flyers , stickers and buttons in an effort to support their causes at a university where activism is not always at the top of the agenda . 
" <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> is called a fairly conservative campus , but I would say students are pretty much apathetic , " First Right President <PERSON>Pallas Lee Van Schaick</PERSON> said . 
Dean of Students <PERSON>Robert T. Canevari</PERSON> compared the energy of student activism in <DATE>1998</DATE> to that of the <DATE>1960s</DATE> . 
" You just ca n't make a comparison , " <PERSON>Canevari</PERSON> said . 
" The activism of yesteryear was much more intense than today . "
