One-in-Four , a peer education group on Grounds , advocates for active bystander intervention as a way to prevent sexual assault . 
The bystander effect describes the human tendency to remain uninvolved in a crisis , with the assumption someone else will intervene . 
Documented across psychology literature , the effect is something several student groups are working to combat . 
Members of One Less and One-in-Four , both student-led sexual assault prevention groups , emphasize the importance of being an active bystander . 
The groups work to educate students about the danger of ignoring a potentially harmful situation and advocate bystander intervention within the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
Peer educators say the first step in being an active bystander is recognizing a potentially harmful situation , particularly by paying attention to body language . 
For example , if someone is crossing their arms or turning away from someone they are talking to , they may be uncomfortable with the situation . 
" I think we can talk all we want about structural and other cultural changes , but it starts with stepping up and not being afraid to lose a little bit of our social capital to make sure everyone at our school stays safe , " said fourth-year College student <PERSON>Will Cadigan</PERSON> , co-chair of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition</ORGANIZATION> . 
" By being active bystanders , we can show that we care about this issue and we will be there to support [ survivors ] no matter what . " 
After evaluating your surroundings , advocates say your intuitions can be strong signals about dangerous surroundings . 
" Maybe you were a little bit wrong , [ but ] does it matter ? 
... No , " said <PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> , project coordinator for <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Response and Prevention</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Students Office</ORGANIZATION> . 
" At the end of the day , it does n't really harm anybody . 
It might be a little bit embarrassing , but I think we can all benefit from learning to be embarrassed more often . " 
In presenting on bystander intervention , peer education groups teach the " Three Ds " along the spectrum of bystander behavior : Direct , Delegate and Distract . 
" Direct " advocates confronting the person involved in the situation . 
" If you 're a person who feels comfortable going up and saying , ' Hey is everything OK ? ' 
that 's great ; that is a part of the community of trust and really fosters our strong community , but you can do whatever you feel comfortable doing , " <PERSON>Cadigan</PERSON> said . 
" Delegate " asks individuals to find someone else who may be more capable of handling the situation . 
This can range from alerting a bartender of a suspicious situation to calling 911 . 
" I ca n't tell you how many <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> police officers and <ORGANIZATION>UPD</ORGANIZATION> officers have told me , ' We would always , always prefer that somebody called us rather than did n't . 
We would rather show up and have nothing be wrong than show up and [ see ] something terrible happened , ' " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said . 
The third D , " Distract , " involves doing something creative to intervene in a potentially harmful situation . 
" One of my favorite distractions is , if it 's a friend of yours , go up and say ' help me find my phone or my wallet , ' " <PERSON>Cadigan</PERSON> said . 
" It makes them leave with you and creates a real pause . " 
Renda says bystander intervention does not necessarily mean taking action before an event has happened . 
Though prevention is ideal , if a traumatic event has occurred , an important form of intervention is being a supportive friend . 
" Being an active bystander means stepping in to say , ' Hey are you OK ? 
I noticed that you seemed a little off today , ' or ' I am here for you , ' " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said . 
Peer educators also emphasize how part of being an active bystander is knowing when to take a step back , acknowledge what you are feeling and discover how to best direct your emotions . 
" It 's OK to be really confused and angry and [ hurt ] and frustrated and exhausted , " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said . 
" Every last one of those is a legitimate response to what 's happened in our community . " 
After students understand their own emotions , <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said , they can channel this emotion toward examination of their own actions , words and thoughts to prevent themselves from perpetuating the problem at hand . 
" We are all mad about our culture , right ? 
We are our culture , " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said . 
" So what everybody needs to do with that anger right now is look in the mirror and think twice about everything we do that reinforces the culture that we live in . "
