After returning home to good old C-ville after attending the <ORGANIZATION>National Student Conference on Campus Sexual Violence</ORGANIZATION> over the <DATE>weekend</DATE> , you can imagine my reaction to hear , upon my return , that two sexual assaults ( one of which was apparently determined false ) had occurred here at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Ironically enough after such a tragic weekend , Playboy came to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to recruit prospective " playmates " for their upcoming issue featuring women of the ACC . 
I always have been an advocate of free speech and publication , but over the weekend I really got an eye opener to the extremely negative effects that pornography has on our society . 
Many argue these women get paid a lot of money and participate voluntarily . 
That , however , is not what really concerns me . 
In many instances of sexual assault , the men do n't see women as human beings but as objects to mutilate . 
This idea may not come directly from pornographic magazines but such publications certainly do n't discourage it . 
These magazines are filled with images of women in unrealistic and often dehumanizing conditions . 
Many times these images and fantasies are even acted out in rapes . 
Sexual assault affects women predominantly . 
It only will be diminished or stopped when men start realizing that we are not just objects available and at their disposal . 
At an institution that promotes equality among all students , one would think that we as a school would not even want to be associated with something so demeaning to women that gives men such negative ideas about who women really are .
