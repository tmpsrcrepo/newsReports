Yesterday , <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> , associate dean of students and chair of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> , released an open letter to Rolling Stone magazine condemning the magazine for its defamatory portrayal of her and her work in its article " A Rape on Campus , " touching upon how the magazine 's failure has affected sexual assault survivors here at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Dean <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> 's letter is not only accurate in its complaints about her own portrayal but also speaks to the severe damage <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> has done to survivors themselves and those who work to help survivors . 
<PERSON>Sabrina Rubin Erdely</PERSON> - the author of the article - did not just incorrectly portray one story ; she mischaracterized the issue of sexual assault on college campuses altogether . 
Following the release of the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Journalism School</ORGANIZATION> 's report on the article , we described our frustrations with the lack of investigation into the magazine 's failures in portraying our school - that while the failure to fact-check the specific incident in question was immense , so was the author , editor and managing editor 's failure to correctly portray the environment they attempted to investigate . 
The damage this has done to our school and us , as students , is incalculable . 
But the damage the article 's portrayal of sexual assault has done to survivors deserves its own analysis . 
Aside from failing in their presentation of Dean <ORGANIZATION>Eramo</ORGANIZATION> 's commendable work - which Dean <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> says in her letter is " sustained by [ her ] passion for assisting young people through one of the most difficult experiences they will ever face " - the article 's author and overseers , after the article 's retraction , only took responsibility for their journalistic failures , and failed to acknowledge the damage their expose into campus sexual assault ultimately caused , however well-intentioned . 
The rape portrayed in " A Rape on Campus " is one of the most extreme versions of rape . 
Most rapes on college campuses are not gang rapes ; they are more similar to the experience <PERSON>Jenny Wilkinson</PERSON> , a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> alumna , described in an op-ed for <ORGANIZATION>The New York Times</ORGANIZATION> . 
The people who put together this article , at least based on their public statements , do not seem to wholly comprehend the damage they have caused to women whose assaults do not fit the mold they presented . 
The danger of their work is not just that survivors may not come forward for fear of being met with disbelief - a serious concern that Erdely mentioned in her recent apology . 
The bigger danger of their work is that survivors will not understand or believe their rapes were , in fact , rape , because what happened to them was n't violent enough by the standards Erdely set out . 
That is the environment that has been created at our school , and , quite possibly , beyond it . 
At our school , this article had tangible , negative effects on students who have been sexually assaulted - one of which was that <PERSON>Dean Eramo</PERSON> , a strong advocate for survivors , had to be removed from working , in her words , " with the students with whom I had spent so much time building a relationship , forcing them to ' start over ' with someone else . " 
Outside our school , this article has perpetuated a false image of rape : that it must look a certain way ; that there is such a thing as a typical victim ; that college campuses , in particular fraternities , are one of the few or perhaps the only space where this kind of oppression exists ; and that the ways to help survivors are obvious . 
We can not overstate the harm these generalizations have created . 
People who are survivors may not see themselves as such , or if they do , they may not report their stories . 
And those who work tirelessly on behalf of survivors and take all the right steps - such as informing survivors of all their options and allowing them the room to make a choice to give them back their agency , something Erdely condemned in her article - must fear that doing the right thing will be manipulated and distorted by an ill-informed public . 
We know that looking backward can provide us with ideas for how to move forward . 
Undoing the harm this one article caused is a bigger challenge than we know how to solve . 
But it starts with educating ourselves not just on why Erdely and her editors committed journalistic malpractice : it starts with understanding what rape is and how they got it wrong .
