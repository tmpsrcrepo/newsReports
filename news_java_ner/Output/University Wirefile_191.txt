" Stop this unjust war ! " 
read the signs at a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> anti-war rally this past weekend . 
" Killers , killers , killers ! " 
protesters shouted in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> , in reference to war supporters . 
And here in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> , at last <DATE>Friday</DATE> 's walk-out and march against the war , students likened <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> to a " tyrant " and deemed the war efforts " unjust . " 
These protesters do not understand how wrong their words are . 
To describe war supporters as " killers " and the war as " unjust " is a simple-minded characterization of the efforts to protect the world from <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> , whose reign has yielded far more horrifying scenes than any protestor could ever imagine . 
Americans do not know what a " tyrant " is . 
But the people of <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> do . 
On <DATE>March 21</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> 's " 20/20 " ran a segment entitled " A Worthy Cause : Women Who Know of <ORGANIZATION>Saddam</ORGANIZATION> 's Brutality Say This War Is Just , " in which four Iraqi women currently living in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> were interviewed about life under <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON> 's regime . 
What they revealed is beyond horrific . 
The women have seen bodies hanging from poles in the middles of village squares . 
One woman 's 16-year-old cousin was beaten and tortured with electrical shocks for writing something against the government in her school notebook . 
According to these women , if a man makes a joke about <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON> , Iraqi authorities will rape the man 's wife and daughters in front of him . 
They videotape the torture and send it to family members as a way to " bring the men into submission . " 
Inside the Iraqi prisons , <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON> keeps " human meat grinders " in which people are " shredded and disposed of in a septic tank . " 
There are " chemical baths " in which prisoners are thrown and left to literally dissolve . 
Perhaps the most visible manifestation of <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON> 's tyranny came fifteen years ago , during <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON> 's " Anfal " campaign of ethnic cleansing , where <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON> ordered the use of chemical weapons to kill over 60,000 of his own people . 
Professor Emeritus <PERSON>Paul S. Shoup</PERSON> wrote in a guest viewpoint column last <DATE>Friday</DATE> that " the Iraqi people have never been given the choice to decide which they would prefer -- the war and its uncertain aftermath , or their present unhappy , but peaceful condition . " 
Well , based on what <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON> does to people who speak out against him , we have no way of asking . 
The four Iraqi women interviewed for " 20/20 " are the voices for the voiceless in their native country and say their " friends and loved ones will welcome the coalition troops with open arms . " 
This rang true as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops entered the Iraqi town of Safwan on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> , with one man weeping , " What took you so long ? 
God help you become victorious . 
I want to say hello to <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> , to shake his hand . 
We came out of the grave " ( " You 're Late " , The Guardian , <DATE>March 22</DATE> . ) 
. 
The Iraqi people are desperate for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops to liberate them from their present unhappy and hardly " peaceful " condition . 
Even those Iraqis who live in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> are frightened to speak about the horrors of <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> , for fear that relatives still living there will be subjected to <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON> 's tyranny . 
Therefore , <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> hears relatively little of what really goes on within the Iraqi borders . 
However , POWs from the first Gulf War have also stepped up to tell their stories , divulging the tortures to which they were subjected . 
" I can tell you that for about 20 minutes of my captivity , they played by the <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> Convention -- the rest of the time , they did not , " said one former soldier ( " Saddam 's Wrath " , <LOCATION>ABCnews.com</LOCATION> , <DATE>March 14</DATE> ) . 
These POWs tell about " unrelenting torture and misery " in which they were blindfolded and beaten , starved , subjected to chemical injections , made to listen to mock executions and castrations and forced to condemn the war on videotape while held at gunpoint . 
Disturbing footage has now surfaced showing the brutally mutilated bodies of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldiers captured by Iraqi forces last week . 
This is the work of a real tyrant . 
Protestors of the war need to wake up . 
The people of <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> are terrified and in dire need of our help . 
Those who question the notion of " pre-emptive war " should ask themselves why , if <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON> was n't planning on attacking anyone , he defied the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> in order to keep his weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that could end up in the hands of terrorists who would love to use them against <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
Or they might remember that <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON> has already murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people with these chemical weapons . 
But mostly , those who oppose the war need only look at the terrified faces of the Iraqi people to understand why <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON> must be removed . 
" Knowing what we 've been through , knowing what the people in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> are going through up to now , and then when we see protesters , that they do n't know the reality of the people who are suffering right now , " said one of the Iraqi women interviewed for " 20/20 " . 
" They do n't know about torture , they do n't know about rape . " 
Protesters can stand on Main Street , wielding signs and denouncing this " unjust " war -- which happens to be supported by <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the American people ( " Support for War Effort Grows , " <LOCATION>CBSnews.com</LOCATION> , <DATE>March 24</DATE> ) -- without the fear of being thrown into a meat grinder . 
This is not the case for the Iraqi people , not until <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON> has been removed . 
Those who deem the war " unjust " do not know what injustice is ; those who call <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> a " tyrant " and our soldiers " killers " do not know the reality of the situation . 
Perhaps next time the war protestors shout to " stop the war , " they 'll think about the Iraqis , halfway around the world , praying for just the opposite .
