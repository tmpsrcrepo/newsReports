University President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> hosted a reception <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in the <ORGANIZATION>Special Collections Library</ORGANIZATION> to discuss the issue of sexual violence at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The reception covered a variety of issues , including the implementation of mandatory campus safety classes for students , how to better support survivors of sexual violence as a community and the issue of alcohol and partying . 
About 150 students , faculty and members of the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> community attended the reception , which included a panel to facilitate discussion . 
Law Prof. <PERSON>Anne Coughlin</PERSON> , a member of the panel , said rape and sexual assault are difficult subjects to teach , but whether mandatory or not , students should have access to a rich offering of classes on the subject . 
Attendees discussed the possibility of required academic classes in which campus life and safety are addressed . 
Panelist <PERSON>Tim Davis</PERSON> , director of <ORGANIZATION>Counseling and Psychological Services</ORGANIZATION> , said counseling is a valuable resource for sexual assault victims . 
" Really , what we have to do is create an environment of introspection , " <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said . 
" Counseling approaches are an amazing way to do that . 
Supporting survivors is a complex process . 
More resources are needed for counseling the survivors . 
We need more counselors . 
We need more resources to give that support to survivors . " 
Panelist <PERSON>Susie Bruce</PERSON> , director of the <ORGANIZATION>Gordie Center for Substance Abuse Prevention</ORGANIZATION> , said proper training for faculty , staff and academic advisors are key to dealing with instances of sexual assault . 
" We want to make sure that all of our faculty and staff know to say ' I believe you and it 's not your fault , ' " <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON> said . 
Panelists and attendants of the reception also discussed the role that alcohol , partying and " hook up " culture play in instances of violence and sexual assault . 
" Alcohol is a contributing factor , " <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON> said . 
" It facilitates assault , but we could get rid of alcohol , and we would still have sexual violence . 
Though alcohol is related , it is not causal . " 
Education Prof. <PERSON>Claire Cameron</PERSON> said she attended the reception to show support for her community and learn more about the issue at hand . 
" I came because this is my community , and I care about it , " <PERSON>Cameron</PERSON> said . 
" I care about the young people especially . 
I think I learned the most from listening and especially from people that play different roles that are connected to the issue . " 
Third-year College student <PERSON>Colby Wagenbach</PERSON> said he thinks the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has work to do to reduce sexual violence in the community . 
" I decided to attend because it 's something that I think we 're not really getting to the heart of the matter about , " <PERSON>Wagenbach</PERSON> said . 
" I think the fact of the matter is , when you see something like the violence that was described , we need to ensure that we have a response that is equally powerful in terms of a willingness to act and affect change . " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said she hopes the discussion will bring about real changes at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" This is an issue that 's going to take the whole community , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" I have hope that U.Va . 
will be a beacon to other communities because we 'll be a place that has figured this out . "
