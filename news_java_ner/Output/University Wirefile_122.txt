University of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> students who are planning to attempt the infamous " Corner Crawl " on their 21st birthdays now will get a card in the mail from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> reminding them of the dangers of drinking irresponsibly . 
The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Team ( ADAPT ) , a student peer education group , will start mailing birthday cards to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students turning 21 urging them to " Celebrate ! 
And Celebrate Responsibly . " 
Students should begin receiving cards today , said <PERSON>Susan Bruce</PERSON> , director of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Alcohol and Substance Education</ORGANIZATION> ( CASE ) , which works with ADAPT to help promote healthy habits in the student body . 
The cards are signed by President <PERSON>John T. Casteen III</PERSON> and will include a wallet-sized pamphlet about the effects of blood alcohol concentration , responsible drinking tips , information about alcohol poisoning and lists of important phone numbers . 
Members of ADAPT and CASE kicked off the program in <LOCATION>Pavilion</LOCATION> XI yesterday by serving free birthday cake and displaying samples of the cards and inserts . 
The purpose of the program is to " remind students to be responsible on their 21st birthdays especially in light of what happened in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> , " ADAPT member <PERSON>Jenny Murrill</PERSON> said . 
A <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> student died <DATE>Nov. 13</DATE> after attempting to drink 21 shots of liquor on his 21st birthday . 
He drank 20 shots in 10 minutes . 
At <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , students traditionally become highly intoxicated when they turn 21 by going to bars on the Corner and drinking as many shots as possible - often attempting to drink 21 shots of liquor . 
ADAPT and other supporting student groups hope to discourage students from drinking recklessly during their birthday " Corner Crawls . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Sorority Council</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Peer Health Educators</ORGANIZATION> , Sexual Assault Facts and Education ( S.A.F.E. ) , the <LOCATION>Asian Student Union</LOCATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Black Fraternal Council</ORGANIZATION> , F.E.S.T. , <ORGANIZATION>First Year Council</ORGANIZATION> and the Fourth Year Trustees all are listed on the new birthday cards as supporters of the program . 
The President 's Office funded the cards , which feature a picture of the <LOCATION>Rotunda</LOCATION> with fireworks in the nighttime sky behind it . 
The Parents Program , a fundraising group , gave ADAPT a grant for the informational inserts . 
CASE will pay the postage for the cards . 
Different fact sheets and inserts will be sent with the cards to men and women because men 's and women 's bodies break down alcohol differently , <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON> said . 
The program came from a recommendation made by the <ORGANIZATION>Alcohol Advisory Committee</ORGANIZATION> at the beginning of the semester , ADAPT member <PERSON>Daya Bill</PERSON> said . 
Bill said they modeled the program after similar ones at other colleges including <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>California Polytechnic Institute</ORGANIZATION> , and <ORGANIZATION>Pomona University</ORGANIZATION> . 
In the <DATE>spring</DATE> , ADAPT will conduct a follow-up survey to see if the cards were effective and how much students actually drank when they turned 21 , she said . 
Bruce added that not only should the students turning 21 act responsibly , but their friends should refrain from pressuring the new 21-year-olds to drink dangerous amounts .
