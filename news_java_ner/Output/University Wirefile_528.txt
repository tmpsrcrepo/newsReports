A committee of students , <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> members , administrators and legal counsel will meet in the coming weeks to draft policy recommendations to be put in place for next semester . 
The magazine article 's account of a gang rape of a girl - identified as <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> - at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> aroused a national response against sexual assault , underage drinking and Greek life . 
In response to mounting protests on Grounds , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> announced the suspension of all fraternal organizations at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> until <DATE>January 9</DATE> . 
Rector <PERSON>George Martin</PERSON> opened the meeting by highlighting the issue of underage drinking . 
He said the correlation between sexual assault and alcohol consumption must be addressed in possible solutions going forward . 
" This is clearly a tragedy , " he said . 
" But we want to turn this tragedy into an opportunity . " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> spoke next , opening her statement on an emotional note . 
" My initial reaction [ to the article ] was numbness , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's experience should not have happened , and nothing like it should ever happen again . " 
She called for a fundamental shift in attitudes and actions toward sexual assault , encouraging students to report offenses first and foremost . 
She announced plans to improve lighting and security measures around student residences , as well as plans to work with the <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Department</ORGANIZATION> to create a police sub-station on the Corner by the start of the <DATE>spring</DATE> semester . 
Charlottesville Police Chief <PERSON>Tim Longo</PERSON> said he welcomed the opportunity to work closely with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to prevent sexual assault . 
" We 're not as good as we should be , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" Our job now is to channel the energy and the passion into action . 
Changing a culture takes a whole community working together , but in particular we need leadership , from our students , our faculty , our staff and our alumni . 
Our University community strongly rejects a culture of sexual violence . 
Together , we need to work together to isolate and exclude any subculture of deviance . " 
Student Council President <PERSON>Jalen Ross</PERSON> , a fourth-year Engineering student , spoke after <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> . 
Though the student body is " overwhelmed , " he said , recent tragedies have provided the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> with a call to action . 
Despite recent criticisms of the Greek system , <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said fraternities have the opportunity to become a positive influence on Grounds . 
" Their structure and their system ... may be the most direct way we can create safety , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Ashley Brown</PERSON> , a fourth-year College student in survivor advocacy group One Less , urged continued action on the issue of sexual assault , even after fresh media attention dies down over the holiday break . 
" I 've been asked over and over again , ' What to do you expect from the administration ? ' " 
she said . 
" My answer has always been ' The strongest support system for survivors . ' " 
<PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said she and other survivor advocates are happy to work with the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> and other student groups as avenues for change are debated and discussed . 
" Though we are a small sliver of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , we are angry , " she said . 
" We are fired up , we are passionate , and we are dedicated to this issue . " 
Inter-Fraternity Council President <PERSON>Tommy Reid</PERSON> , a fourth-year College student , said the Rolling Stone article provided the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> a wake-up call . 
" Addressing this issue requires consistent , individual and collective commitments to cultural change across our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and our fraternities , " he said . 
" That 's our biggest problem . 
No one wants to give attention to this issue because it 's too painful . " 
<PERSON>Reid</PERSON> emphasized the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> 's commitment to aggressively preventing rape and sexual assault , through measures that should include , among other things , stricter punishments for sexual offenders . 
" Rape must stop at U.Va. , " he said . 
Hawa Ahmed , a fourth-year College student and co-chair of substance abuse prevention organization ADAPT , spoke to the dangers of alcohol consumption . 
She expressed a desire to eliminate hard liquor at fraternity parties . 
" Almost all sexual assaults " are associated with alcohol consumption , she said . 
" Still , if you waved a magic wand and eliminated all drinking , you would still have sexual assault . " 
Ahmed said fraternities have the option to be the safest places on Grounds , if proper measures are put into place . 
Student member of the <ORGANIZATION>Board Meg Gould</ORGANIZATION> , a fourth-year College student , pointed out that all students at the meeting were fourth-years , who will be graduating soon and leaving their contributions behind . 
" We need this [ conversation ] to extend beyond our time at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , " she said . 
Several Board members followed the student leaders , offering praise and criticism to their policy suggestions . 
Board member <PERSON>Bobbie Kilberg</PERSON> advocated for police presence at fraternity parties to prevent and punish underage drinking . 
" I 'd rather do something that 's right and bring parents back into this equation , " she said . 
<PERSON>L.D. Britt</PERSON> criticized the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> for not responding to the incident at <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> earlier . 
" Did we not know about <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> prior to Rolling Stone ? 
, " he asked . 
" I do n't think anybody on Rolling Stone went to U.Va . " 
<PERSON>Longo</PERSON> said the investigation would provide an answer to that question soon , and he asked the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> not divulge that information to the public until the investigation is complete . 
Board member <PERSON>Barbara Fried</PERSON> suggested creating an all-female committee to tackle the issue of sexual assault . 
Board member <PERSON>Helen Dragas</PERSON> , who became emotional when giving introductory remarks , elicited the most positive response from the audience , eliciting a stream of thumbs-up symbols as she called for more women to speak at the table in the boardroom . 
" Part of the reason we got here is because we swept things under the rug , " she said . 
" Let 's show the world we can put safety above our reputation . " 
<PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said efforts towards a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault will be in place by the start of second semester .
