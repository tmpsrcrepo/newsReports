The comics page seems like one of The Cavalier Daily 's more popular sections , but I must confess I generally do n't pay much attention to it . 
That 's by no means an indictment of the quality of the comics . 
I just never thought the newspaper would print anything on the Comics page that I would have to worry about as ombudsman . 
Unfortunately , I 've been given some reasons in the last few weeks to pay closer attention . 
The week before winter break , a couple of readers wrote angry letters to the editor ( " An unfunny subject " and " No laughing matter , " <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> ) about a comic strip that featured the infamous photo of a South Vietnamese general executing a captured <ORGANIZATION>Viet Cong</ORGANIZATION> soldier . 
In mid-February , another reader ( " Reconsider Redux , " <DATE>Feb. 23</DATE> ) complained about a " stupid and offensive " strip that involved an oral sex joke . 
The latest controversy on the Comics page came up <DATE>Feb. 28</DATE> . 
All 10 strips that day looked exactly alike but contained different dialogue . 
Nine of the strips were based on <PERSON>Bob Wiley</PERSON> 's " <LOCATION>Congo Square</LOCATION> , " which some of the cartoonists and at least one reader ( " Tasteful statement , " Mar. 3 ) apparently thought was about sexual assault . 
First of all , <PERSON>Wiley</PERSON> assured me that the punch line of the strip had nothing to do with sexual assault . 
I realize I 'm about to sound as funny as <PERSON>Sean Penn</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>Academy Awards</ORGANIZATION> , but the final frame was supposed to imply the character 's girlfriend was really ugly . 
I 'm sure some of the paper 's readers still do n't like the joke . 
I bet they 'd agree , however , that 's a whole lot less offensive than what some people thought the strip was suggesting . 
The larger issue here is how The Cavalier Daily allowed its other cartoonists to respond to <ORGANIZATION>Wiley</ORGANIZATION> 's comic . 
Editor-in-Chief <PERSON>Patrick Harvey</PERSON> told me the cartoonists will occasionally participate in " comic wars " in which they make fun of each other 's strips . 
<PERSON>Wiley</PERSON> admitted he has willingly participated in a couple of them , but from what he said , they have always had a lighthearted tone . 
Something about this latest comic war did n't seem playful . 
With some degree of organization , the other cartoonists took <PERSON>Wiley</PERSON> 's <DATE>Feb. 28</DATE> strip and replaced it with dialogue of their own . 
In several cases , that new dialogue contained personal attacks on one of their fellow cartoonists for creating what many of them appeared to think was an offensive comic . 
The Mar. 3 letter to the editor praised the cartoonists for being " rightfully offended " by <ORGANIZATION>Wiley</ORGANIZATION> 's strip . 
Clearly , the cartoonists and some readers felt the strip contained offensive material . 
If the Graphics editors or the <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> believed it was offensive , they never should have published it . 
Instead , the cartoonists and the higher-ups who approved the page publicly embarrassed <PERSON>Wiley</PERSON> . 
Several of <ORGANIZATION>The Cavalier Daily</ORGANIZATION> 's staff members handled this situation in anything but a professional manner . 
That 's disappointing given that the staff 's professionalism has consistently impressed me this year . 
I have tried hard as The Cavalier Daily 's ombudsman not to act as the arbiter of what crosses the line into tastelessness . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Communication Commission</ORGANIZATION> has taken that role with television and radio broadcasters and made them scared to air anything the least bit controversial or provocative . 
A college newspaper should enable the free flow of ideas whenever possible , and I do n't plan to stand in the way of that mission . 
Editors , however , must decide whether something is so offensive that it absolutely ca n't run . 
Harvey mentioned to me that he has prevented a few comics from reaching the inside pages of <ORGANIZATION>The Cavalier Daily</ORGANIZATION> . 
But the <DATE>Feb. 28</DATE> Comics page and the prior complaints indicate the paper needs to establish a firm procedure for handling potentially offensive material . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily</ORGANIZATION> 's policy manual sets rules and guidelines for nearly every department . 
When I scanned over it , I noticed it contains no mention of comic strips . 
Now might be a good time for the Graphics editors and the <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> to revisit the manual . 
They should avoid drawing a hard line in the manual between what is and is not offensive , but they should establish some procedure for making that decision .
