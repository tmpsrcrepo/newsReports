When Col. <PERSON>Loren Loomis</PERSON> ' house burned down , he lost more than his furniture and living space : He lost his job and his plans for retirement . 
Amid the wreckage , a firefighter found a videotape that revealed <PERSON>Loomis</PERSON> to be gay . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> 's response was harsh but predictable : It discharged him under " other than honorable " conditions . 
Had he served for another week , <PERSON>Loomis</PERSON> would have reached his 20-year career mark and received full retirement benefits . 
The dishonorable discharge left him with none . 
Unfortunately , <PERSON>Loomis</PERSON> is not alone . 
Hundreds of American soldiers suffer a similar fate each year . 
In <DATE>2005</DATE> , 726 service members lost their jobs as a result of the military 's blatantly discriminatory " Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell " policy . 
To defend these dismissals , military and government leaders claim that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would damage troop morale and effectiveness . 
They stress their support for " Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell " only reflects the importance of unit cohesion in the military and the demographics of soldiers -- not any personal prejudices against gays and lesbians . 
In acknowledging homophobia among troops , however , these leaders choose to permit discrimination rather than combat it . 
In addition to directly discriminating against gays and lesbians , " Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell " legitimizes and intensifies homophobia in all parts of society . 
The military can dramatically influence the sentiments of the general public . 
Its policies can break down barriers to civil liberties or erect them . 
In the case of African-Americans , the military acted as a pioneer for civil rights by desegregating before much of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
For gays and lesbians , it does the opposite . 
During World War II , the <ORGANIZATION>Tuskegee Airmen</ORGANIZATION> , an all-black air unit , inspired blacks and compelled whites to question their racist presumptions . 
In <DATE>2003</DATE> , Major <PERSON>Margaret Witt</PERSON> received the <ORGANIZATION>Air Medal</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force Commendation Medal</ORGANIZATION> from President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> . 
In the same year , after an investigation revealed her sexual orientation , she lost her job . 
Before dismissing her , the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> used Major <PERSON>Witt</PERSON> as a poster woman in its recruiting program -- she could have also been a poster woman for all American lesbians . 
Instead , as soon as the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> discovered her sexual preference , it dismissed her . 
With " Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell " in place , the gay and lesbian communities will never have their own <ORGANIZATION>Tuskegee Airmen</ORGANIZATION> . 
In an age when American businesses or colleges would never publicly exclude gays and lesbians , the military does just that . 
As American soldiers fight tyranny abroad , " Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell " defends prejudice at home . 
If a policy banned openly Jewish or Muslim Americans from joining the military , a public outcry would surely ensue . 
But as long as only the LGBT community suffers , the vast majority of Americans remain silent . 
Here at the university , we can not remain silent . 
We must recognize the clear prejudice of " Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell . " 
Obviously , as students , we can not enact new laws or directly change military policy . 
However , we can start to make a difference by increasing awareness on grounds . 
" All students , especially students in ROTC , should educate themselves about the policy and contact their representatives , " said <PERSON>Wyatt Fore</PERSON> , former president of <ORGANIZATION>Queer and Allied Activism</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Many students do not know that over 10,000 soldiers have been kicked out since <DATE>1993</DATE> . 
' Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell ' tried to be a compromise , but it failed . " 
As Fore says , even as students , we can help support a better military policy by promoting awareness of the impact " Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell " has on the lives of thousands of service members . 
" Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell " accepts the status quo of bigotry within the military -- it responds to intolerance with more intolerance . 
To reduce prejudice , a new policy must force the military and its troops to eliminate homophobia in order to survive . 
As with the desegregation of blacks , the military must enact programs to teach appropriate attitudes and announce a zero-tolerance policy on anti-gay harassment . 
Under " Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell , " homophobic soldiers have no reason to change their attitudes , and the military has no reason to encourage tolerance . 
The military can reduce homophobia , and soldiers can learn to live and work with gays and lesbians . 
But a new policy must first force them to change . 
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> military fights across the world in the name of liberty and justice , but it actively denies freedom within its own ranks . 
Americans have fought to liberate <LOCATION>Koreans</LOCATION> , Vietnamese , Bosnians and Iraqis . 
Now , we must wage war at home . 
Gay and lesbian soldiers -- like their heterosexual comrades -- are brave and loyal Americans . 
If they wish to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country , we should let them .
