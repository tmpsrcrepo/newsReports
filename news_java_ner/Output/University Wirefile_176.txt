" The incident locations are within four or five miles of each other and are similar in nature as far as neighborhood dynamics , " <ORGANIZATION>Albemarle County Police</ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON>Peter Mainzer</PERSON> said . 
" Ivy Gardens is an apartment complex and <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown Greens</ORGANIZATION> are townhomes . 
So we 're looking at that particular aspect . "

In the first incident " the suspect climbed onto the third floor balcony .

According to <PERSON>Mainzer</PERSON> , the first incident occurred at about <TIME>2 a.m. Thursday morning</TIME> in the <LOCATION>Ivy Gardens</LOCATION> apartment complex . 
The suspect entered the bedroom of a sleeping woman , punched her in the head and sexually assaulted her .

County police suspect that the man ran away after noticing the woman 's roommate was home . 
The victim was treated for cuts and bruises by rescue personnel .

The second woman described her assailant as a black man , 5 feet 8 to 5 feet 10 inches tall , 160 to 175 pounds with facial hair . 
Although police are investigating possible links between the assaults , they are not yet certain of a connection . 
" The time of day was completely different , and the suspect information was pretty vague on the first incident , " <PERSON>Mainzer</PERSON> said . 
" The only obvious connection is that the neighborhoods are within four or five miles of each other . " 
Mainzer encourages young women living in apartments to be extra vigilant about safety . 
" Do the common sense type things like locking your door , even if you live on an upper level , " <PERSON>Mainzer</PERSON> said . 
" Do n't assume that because you live off the ground level that you can leave your doors and windows insecure . " 
Anyone with information on the assault incidents should call Albemarle police at 296-5807 or Crimestoppers at 977-4000 .
