Find Your <ORGANIZATION>Voice</ORGANIZATION> , a new arts organization on Grounds , is aiming to encapsulate the student experience in performance - putting on monthly showcases which highlight students ' real-life stories to promote awareness about a prevalent issue around Grounds . 
The group will tackle a new awareness campaign or organization each month - and its kicking off with #HoosGotYourBack , a sexual assault prevention and bystander intervention effort launched by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> this <DATE>fall</DATE> . 
FYV 's , cosponsoring with <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Players</ORGANIZATION> , the Office of the Dean of Students , and various advocacy organizations around Grounds , will put on its productions free of charge , but performers will accept donations , which go directly to the organization featured each month . 
A secondary goal of the organization is to bridge the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community - working to merge drama students with the greater <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> population . 
FYV founder and third-year College student <PERSON>Andrew Burrill</PERSON> said most students are largely disconnected from the drama department 's efforts - a fact that hit home when he conducted an informal survey of his peers . 
" Seventy-five percent of them have never been to a production willingly within the department of drama here at U.Va. , " he said . 
" I feel that is unacceptable for many reasons . " 
Find Your <ORGANIZATION>Voice</ORGANIZATION> members aim to introduce people with limited theatrical experience to the department 's talent and facilities by touching on subjects which are particularly salient and important to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community - be it sexual misconduct to bullying . 
The group aims to attract those with less experience to partake in its produtions - a goal it hopes to achieve in part with a limited time commitment , only asking members for an hour or two of weekly rehearsals . 
" The power of theater is something , ... existential in its own right and has the ability to move people past experiences which they 've latched onto and they ca n't move forward from , " <PERSON>Burrill</PERSON> said . " 
[ It can ] really give [ people ] ... a sense of identity . " 
<PERSON>Burrill</PERSON> said he hopes <ORGANIZATION>Find Your Voice</ORGANIZATION> can serve as part of the healing process for people who may have experienced trauma on an emotional or physical level from any of the issues the organization raises . 
. 
" There are official routes to go to seek solutions for these issues - CAPS , the Women 's Center ... but there 's no creative outlet for the heart ... there 's no medicine for the heart , " <PERSON>Burrill</PERSON> said . 
" If you continue to ... just put wallpaper over a rotting wall then eventually the rot is going to seep through and no amount of wallpaper can make it look what it is n't . 
... The series is there for you whenever you need some aspirin for your heart . " 
Find Your <ORGANIZATION>Voice</ORGANIZATION> 's upcoming show will be held <DATE>Oct. 26</DATE> at <TIME>2 p.m.</TIME> in the <ORGANIZATION>Helms Theatre</ORGANIZATION> .
