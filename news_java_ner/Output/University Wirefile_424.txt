With a recent spike in highly-publicized collegiate tragedies attributed to mental illness , increased attention is being paid to deficiencies in psychological and counseling services universities offer . 
State incidents , including the campus massacre of 32 <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> students in <DATE>2007</DATE> and the number of suicides which occur every year , have increased pressure on <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> schools to both meet and monitor the mental health of young adults . 
Dr. <PERSON>James Turner</PERSON> , former <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> executive director of <ORGANIZATION>Student Health</ORGANIZATION> , found suicide outpaced alcohol related incidents as a leading cause of death in his <DATE>2011</DATE> study , " Leading Causes of <ORGANIZATION>Mortality Among American College Students</ORGANIZATION> at Four-Year Institutions . " 
According to the study , the rate of student suicide has remained constant since the <DATE>1980s</DATE> , suggesting a lack of successful preventative action around the issue . 
Several of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's peer institutions struggle with incidents of mental illness . 
In <DATE>2010</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> junior <PERSON>Cameron Dabaghi</PERSON> committed suicide by jumping off the observation deck of the <ORGANIZATION>Empire State</ORGANIZATION> building . 
The same year , six students committed suicide at <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION> , two of them jumping off bridges on campus . 
In <DATE>January this year</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> freshman <PERSON>Madison Holleran</PERSON> jumped to her death from the roof of a parking garage in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> . 
Since <PERSON>Holleran</PERSON> 's death , two more students at the university have also committed suicide , and a graduate student committed suicide while away from campus in <DATE>December</DATE> , bringing the total to four student suicides at the university for this academic year . 
Despite these incidents , students claim universities are at times reluctant to support victims . 
After her suicide attempt while at <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Rachel Williams</PERSON> was forced to withdraw from the university with no guaranteed readmission . 
After a one-year leave of absence , the university allowed her to reapply and return to the university only after carefully screening her mental health and ensuring she posed no liability , <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> wrote in a column for the <ORGANIZATION>Yale Daily News</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Those of us who have admitted , at some point or another , that we are legitimately not okay , have learned that there are real and devastating consequences of telling the truth , " she wrote . 
" Because Yale does not want people who are not okay . 
Yale does not want people who are struggling , who are fighting . 
Yale , out of concern for its own image , wants them to leave . 
And <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> makes them . " 
A victim of a sexual assault , <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> senior <PERSON>Carissa Lunquist</PERSON> checked herself into the hospital in <DATE>October</DATE> after her attacker was acquitted . 
When she returned to school in <DATE>January</DATE> , the university did not confirm her re-enrollment until mid-February . 
Lunquist said she would have taken legal action against the university if she had not been re-enrolled . 
" I feel like <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> wants me to say I 'm okay , I 've moved past it , " she said to the <ORGANIZATION>The Daily Pennsylvanian</ORGANIZATION> . 
" But I 'm not going to tell them that things are fine . 
... Being here is really hard because of the way the whole system seems to have failed me , even though I did the whole process correctly . " 
Though Yale and <ORGANIZATION>the University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> each offer free counseling services to all students , both schools ' systems have received recent criticism . 
In <DATE>2013</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>Yale College Council 's Report on Mental Health</ORGANIZATION> said " negative perceptions of [ <ORGANIZATION>Mental Health and Counseling</ORGANIZATION> ] are prevalent . " 
The report cited long wait times before initial appointments and too few therapists for the number of patients as causes of concern . 
In 2012-13 , the average wait time for an appointment with the school mental health services at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> was 13.2 days . 
According to an article in <ORGANIZATION>The Daily Pennsylvanian</ORGANIZATION> , this has been a large contributor to rising student dissatisfaction with the system . 
A look at <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech Services Since</ORGANIZATION> the massacre <DATE>seven years ago</DATE> - in which undergraduate student Seung-Hui Cho fired upon 47 individuals , killing 32 before committing suicide - <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> has expanded the resources of the <ORGANIZATION>Cook Counseling Center</ORGANIZATION> , the university 's main mental health services provider . 
" We 're changing and evolving all the time , " said <PERSON>Charles Anderson</PERSON> , associate director of the <ORGANIZATION>Center</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We 've gone to this walk-in system just as of this year , beginning in the <DATE>fall of 2013</DATE> . 
We 're always trying to improve our services and take a good look at ourselves to try and see how we can do our work better , do our jobs better . " 
In addition to this change , which allows students in distress to be seen without a set appointment , the <ORGANIZATION>Center</ORGANIZATION> retains an on-call counselor - available to students at any time day or night - and conducts a weekly health and wellness series . 
The Center also provides training to faculty , staff , students and resident assistants . 
Since the <DATE>2007</DATE> tragedy , <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> has established a threat assessment team comprised of multiple departments - incorporating members of the Office of the Dean of Students , the <ORGANIZATION>Counseling Center</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech Police Department</ORGANIZATION> , among others - to review cases of potential threat on campus , whether from students , faculty or staff . 
The university also established the Crisis Assessment , <ORGANIZATION>Response and Education Team</ORGANIZATION> to address issues pertaining exclusively to the student body . 
" It is a way of responding to emerging concerns that might show up that are n't necessarily threat related but might be related to students ' psychological wellbeing , " <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> said . 
" Since <DATE>2007</DATE> , there have been a lot of changes that have taken place not only at <LOCATION>Virginia Tech</LOCATION> , but really across the country . " 
Other campuses , including <ORGANIZATION>Temple University</ORGANIZATION> , have followed <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> 's lead . 
" The CARE Team was formalized following the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> shootings to provide a central resource for those troubled by students ' problematic behaviors , " <ORGANIZATION>Temple University 's Faculty Herald</ORGANIZATION> newsletter stated . 
" Typical CARE Team referrals include matters of self injury , suicide attempts , depression ... and a wide range of other issues . " 
Another major change at the <ORGANIZATION>Cook Counseling Center</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> added , has been the launch of a case manager position . 
" He not only helps us deal with behavioral issues on campus and providing assessments for people that we 're concerned about - he also is involved in tracking people here who might go into the hospital system , " <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> said . 
" We are able to coordinate follow-up care after they are released from the hospital , and we are also able to have an active role in the decision-making process for whether or not a person is ready to be released back into the community . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> continues to face a significant challenge , however , in that students who check into the hospital on a voluntary basis are not required to inform the university . 
" They have no obligation to let us know , " <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> said . 
" This is an area where a person 's right to seek treatment overrides anything else . " 
<ORGANIZATION>William & Mary Services The William & Mary Counseling Center</ORGANIZATION> offers scheduled appointments throughout the week for students . 
In the event of an emergency - described explicitly as suicide threats or attempts , rape , sexual assault or other trauma , and severely disorganized , psychotic , or out of control behavior - the Center staff are on-call and available for students at all times . 
The college is the former school of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON>Creigh</PERSON> Deeds ' son Austin " Gus " Deeds , who repeatedly stabbed his father before taking his own life last <DATE>November</DATE> . 
Gus suffered from bipolar disorder and had been enrolled at <ORGANIZATION>William & Mary</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>2007</DATE> , though <ORGANIZATION>William & Mary</ORGANIZATION> spokesperson <PERSON>Brian Whitson</PERSON> told The Guardian Deeds ' time at the university was not continuous . 
Gus withdrew from the school a month before the stabbing ensued . 
The Center also provides consultations to RAs with specific concerns about students in their care , and hosts a range of workshops and programs encompassing issues surrounding relationships , academics and personal health and wellbeing , which are available upon request . 
The director of the <ORGANIZATION>William & Mary Counseling Center</ORGANIZATION> was not available for comment .
