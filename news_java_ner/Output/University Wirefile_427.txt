On <DATE>October 3 , 2013</DATE> at around <TIME>3:30 p.m.</TIME> , I was picked up during my class at <ORGANIZATION>Wilson Hall</ORGANIZATION> by two police officers . 
I found out that I had been charged with felony rape and abduction by an ex-girlfriend who claimed this event happened sometime between <DATE>March 1</DATE> to <DATE>June 1 of 2012</DATE> in a different part of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> without specifying an exact day or month . 
I was promptly arrested , put into the cruiser , and transported to the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Regional Jail where I would spend four nights awaiting my bond hearing . 
During my second day in jail at <TIME>12:40 p.m.</TIME> , I received a letter from Dean Groves . 
I had been suspended from the university because , in his words , he was abiding to their responsibility to " maintain a safe and secure environment for all members of the community " . 
It said that I could not be allowed on Grounds without special permission and that I would be held on trial by the <ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> even though the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> had not even conducted a proper investigation of the matter themselves . 
Upon being bailed out , I worked closely with my lawyer to prepare my defense . 
There was no telling how long the case could drag on for . 
The trial could be scheduled sometime in the <DATE>spring of 2014</DATE> and I did not want to be gone from <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> for that long . 
I appealed to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to reinstate me during the duration of my legal case on <DATE>Tuesday , November 12th , 2013</DATE> . 
I prepared a case that included documents that supported my innocence , about a dozen character letters , and six witnesses . 
I was brought forth before the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's triumvirate of Vice-President <PERSON>Patricia M. Lampkin</PERSON> , Dean of Students <PERSON>Allen Groves</PERSON> , and <PERSON>Susan Davis</PERSON> , who is the <ORGANIZATION>Associate Vice President of Student Affairs</ORGANIZATION> . 
I presented my documents , witnesses , and arguments before them . 
I answered their questions and after an hour of arguing for my reinstatement , Dean Groves asked whether there was any information I was not revealing , since it would be unusual for charges to be filed if there was not some kind of evidence against me . 
There was the suspicion that I must be hiding something or perhaps that the prosecution had a stronger case than I expected . 
There was the idea that the police acted on good faith and would not go forward on an unsubstantiated accusation . 
There was the question of why would someone make a false accusation ? 
Who would be stupid enough to put themselves in a situation where they would perjure themselves ? 
The charges were subsequently dropped three days later because the complainant 's statements at the preliminary hearing were inconsistent with facts of the case previously established during the investigation . 
After the charges were dropped , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> ended my suspension , and I returned to school on <DATE>November 17th</DATE> . 
I rejoined my activities immediately and got back into the swing of things . 
The administration expressed their surprise and thoughts about what happened to me . 
My return to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> was not anticipated , nor was it expected to happen so quickly . 
It was expected I would plead guilty to a lesser charge because of the weight of the allegations . 
I am one of few students who have successfully resumed my life at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> after being charged of serious felonies . 
I am not honored for holding this position by any means . 
I was told that it was unfortunate that this happened and that the system is imperfect , but that ultimately a semester is n't really that much time in the grand scale of things . 
I lost thousands of dollars in legal fees alone , I lost my fall semester , and I had to bear the anguish of spending five nights and six days in a jail cell . 
In that one semester , I was unable to salvage any credits and lost opportunities to enhance my social life at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Upon my return , I was asked by my peers where I was , what had happened to me , and why were police escorting me out of <PERSON>Wilson Hall</PERSON> that day . 
I never had a good explanation for anyone . 
The administration told me that there were lessons learned from my events . 
It was a sobering reality to them that people do get falsely accused and that we do not live in a perfect world . 
The police are n't perfect , the university is n't perfect , the court system is n't perfect , and I am not perfect , which all contributed to the storm of events I was caught in . 
Along with recent incidents at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> and in a changing world , policy regarding criminal charges has transitioned to an extreme where it involves action first and questions later . 
Will they suspend the next student based on an accusation as opposed to a ruling by the court ? 
There is no clear consensus on the administration 's part on what to do if this happens again to another student . 
I would hope that from my example , that there would be a thorough investigation on the university 's part to look at the facts before jumping to a decision that could potentially impact a student 's life in negative ways . 
The administration told me that they must maintain a safe environment for all their students , but where was the compelling evidence that I would compromise that environment ? 
An accusation and a conviction are not synonymous , and the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should be more sensitive and thoughtful in potential future situations when something of this nature occurs . 
It would be best for <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> to find a happy medium where they do not ignore complaints without jeopardizing the presumption of innocence that we as human beings should be granted until the courts come to a verdict . 
The stakes are high and it is unreasonable to put an innocent person at risk of having their life disrupted for something they never did . 
I share my anecdote in hopes that our rights as students of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> are observed when we are in our darkest hour and at our most vulnerable .
