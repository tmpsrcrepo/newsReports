More than 90 colleges - including <ORGANIZATION>George Washington University</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION> , and the <ORGANIZATION>University of Maryland</ORGANIZATION> - offer gender-neutral housing , a housing option that would allow students to select roommates , suitemates or apartment-mates without regard to sex or gender . 
And this number is climbing . 
<ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION> recently approved gender-neutral living options after significant student pressure . 
As I write , <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> students are voting on a referendum to universalize their limited gender-neutral housing policies . 
Schools adopt such a policy for different reasons - some to grant students greater freedom and responsibility in shaping their college experiences , others to acknowledge the needs and preferences of LGBTQ students . 
The policy is a natural response to evolving cultural attitudes toward gender and sexuality . 
But with all this change in dorm room living , where is the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> 's gender-neutral housing movement ? 
In my five semesters at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> so far , I remember the issue being mentioned only two or three times . 
Researching our history with the topic , the last organized <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> effort I found was a <DATE>2011</DATE> petition on change.org . 
The most recent article I found in this newspaper that focuses on the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's gender housing policies at any significant length is an opinion column that also dates to <DATE>2011</DATE> . 
So while other schools have led entire ( successful ) movements - petitions , public discussions , protests - for mixed housing , students at our university have failed to even raise gender-neutral housing as an issue for debate . 
If we take the dozens of other colleges as case studies , it 's clear such policies require student action in order to become a reality . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> offers first-year and upperclass co-ed dormitory buildings , but each floor or suite is limited to one sex . 
It does not currently provide a gender-neutral living option and deals with transgender students on a case-by-case basis - generally offering single housing . 
Proponents approach the issue from different angles , but perhaps least controversial at a " student-governance " - oriented school like ours might be the argument that it increases student freedom . 
Our school encourages students to mold the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> into the type of community we desire . 
We run the honor system and <ORGANIZATION>the University Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> , as well as hundreds of clubs and a complex ( if not always effective ) student government . 
With so many responsibilities , does n't the ability to choose our roommates - without conditions of sex or gender - seem consistent and fair ? 
After all , students are legal adults who inevitably spend their entire college experience living and working among the opposite sex . 
But perhaps the most common argument for gender-neutral housing is the recognition and support it shows the LGBTQ community . 
Though many students do not see the appeal of a different-gender roommate , many in the LGBTQ community feel safer and more comfortable in such living conditions . 
The high-profile suicide of <ORGANIZATION>Rutgers</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Tyler Clementi</PERSON> comes to mind - and <ORGANIZATION>Rutgers</ORGANIZATION> found that its subsequent gender-neutral housing options helped create a more inclusive environment . 
Such choices are particularly valuable for transgender students , who - besides fearing discrimination and harassment - might have a more difficult time expressing their identity in same-sex housing . 
All things considered , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policies that ignore the needs and preferences of LGBTQ students are insensitive and neglectful at best , and outright discriminatory at worst . 
As we are seeing this week at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> - as well as dozens of schools before it - student activism is the driving force behind gender-neutral housing . 
To start the transition , why not designate a few gender-neutral floors and suites ? 
The process would be opt-in , so students who feel uncomfortable living among the opposite sex would not be assigned to such spaces . 
Some students in residence life who I have spoken to worry that gender-neutral areas might become targets of anti-gay attitudes and marginalization . 
I do not find this convincing . 
Even at our <ORGANIZATION>Southern</ORGANIZATION> , relatively conservative school , attitudes toward the LGBTQ community reflect those of the nation ( i.e. increasing tolerance , particularly among young people ) . 
Moreover , higher education contains too many thriving case studies ( for both limited and universal gender-neutral housing ) to disregard these options with simple hypotheticals . 
I do not ask our university to be radical but merely adopt the more open and democratic policies of so many of its fellow educational institutions . 
Would the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> be responsive to student concerns and interests ? 
At a school that emphasizes student self-governance , one would hope and expect so . 
One aspect is certain - gender-neutral housing will not arrive at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> anytime soon without support from its students .
