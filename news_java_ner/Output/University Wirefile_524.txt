<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily The University Glee Club</ORGANIZATION> announced last week it would temporarily retire the song " Rugby Road " in the wake of the Rolling Stone article published <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE> alleging a brutal gang rape by several individuals at a party at the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity house in <DATE>Sept. 2012</DATE> . 
In the article , author <PERSON>Sabrina Rubin Erdely</PERSON> periodically employed lyrics from the song to highlight the presence of a " rape culture " on Grounds . 
Erdely described " Rugby Road " as a " jolly fight song which celebrates the sexual triumphs of U.Va . 
fraternity men . " 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Zachary Seid</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>Glee Club</ORGANIZATION> , said the group would retire the song , " at least through the end of this semester , and potentially the next . " 
Seid announced the decision in an email sent to the entire <ORGANIZATION>Glee Club</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE> . 
In the email , he said this action was necessary " to protect the <ORGANIZATION>Club</ORGANIZATION> and its endeavors from being sidetracked or waylaid by those who would object to our singing it . " 
The first two verses of the song - which are the commonly known - span the subjects of heavy drinking , comradery and sexual encounters . 
The first verse reads : " From Rugby Road to Vinegar Hill , we 're gon na get drunk tonight / The faculty 's afraid of us ; they know we 're in the right / So fill your cups , your loving cups , as full as full can be / For as long as love and liquor last we 'll drink to the U. of V. " The second verse , meanwhile , reads : " All you girls from <ORGANIZATION>Mary Washington / And R.M.W.C.</ORGANIZATION> , never let a Cavalier an inch above your knee / He 'll take you to his fraternity house and fill you full of beer / And soon you 'll be the mother of a bastard Cavalier ! " 
According to <ORGANIZATION>University Historian Sandy Gilliam</ORGANIZATION> , the song comes from a long tradition of university fight songs and is not unique in content . 
Old editions of Corks and Curls , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's yearbook , are filled with drinking songs and stories . 
<PERSON>Gilliam</PERSON> said he does not know where the song originated , but speculates it developed sometime after World War I , perhaps as a way for students to protest against restrictions during Prohibition . 
Some say the song is based off the <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> Tech marching song , but <PERSON>Gilliam</PERSON> said he believes the tune comes from an old drinking song called the " Bastard King of <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> . " 
<PERSON>Gilliam</PERSON> , who graduated from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1955</DATE> , was only aware of the first two verses , and a chorus , which reads , " Oh , I think we need another drink . 
Hey ! 
/ I think we need another drink . 
Hey ! 
/ I think we need another drink for the glory of the U.V.A. ! " 
In her article , <PERSON>Erdely</PERSON> said the song has 35 verses , some written by students through recent decades . 
" We sang it all the time , " <PERSON>Gilliam</PERSON> said of his student days . 
<PERSON>Gillam</PERSON> said the Rolling Stone article does not accurately portray the song 's intention or how it is perceived among the student body . 
" Rolling Stone seems to equate the song with bad behavior - that 's just not true , " <PERSON>Gilliam</PERSON> said . 
" Every student group used to have songs . " 
The Rolling Stone article said the song is still performed by The <PERSON>Virginia Gentlemen</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's oldest a cappella group . 
Third-year Engineering student <PERSON>Rohan Deshpande</PERSON> , president of <ORGANIZATION>The Virginia Gentlemen</ORGANIZATION> , said in the past , the group only sang " Rugby Road " on occasion . 
They have now struck the song from their repertoire completely . 
" It 's not really our song , " <PERSON>Deshpande</PERSON> said . 
" Rugby Road " is the title of the group 's <DATE>2010</DATE> album . 
A rendition of the song can be hear on the VG 's <DATE>2003</DATE> 50th Anniversary album , Gold . 
" I was surprised it was so long , " <PERSON>Desphande</PERSON> said on the number of verses referenced in the Rolling Stone article . 
He said he spoke with some <PERSON>Virginia Gentlemen</PERSON> alumni who " were shocked . " " 
[ They ] thought it was only two verses long , " he said . 
Desphande said the song was originally performed by the <ORGANIZATION>Glee Club</ORGANIZATION> , which included The <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Gentlemen</ORGANIZATION> members until the <DATE>1980s</DATE> . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>Glee Club</ORGANIZATION> has only ever sung the first two verses , " <PERSON>Seid</PERSON> said . 
" The Rolling Stone article was the first time I 'd ever heard of the others . " 
The other verses mentioned in the article are more sexually explicit and mention some sororities by name . 
<PERSON>Seid</PERSON> said <PERSON>Erdely</PERSON> contacted him in <DATE>September</DATE> to ask for the whole song , which she believed to be more than just the first two verses . 
<PERSON>Seid</PERSON> said he is not sure when the <ORGANIZATION>Glee Club</ORGANIZATION> added the song to its repertoire . 
" We have about as much institutional memory as any other CIO , " <PERSON>Seid</PERSON> said . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Glee Club</ORGANIZATION> has sung the song for at least 12 years - as long as the choir 's current conductor has been with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The group did not pen the song 's lyrics . 
" I believe that it 's up to everyone to determine what the song is about for themselves , " <PERSON>Seid</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Seid</PERSON> said it can be seen as " a fun-spirited drinking song " which does not imply lack of consent , but noted the <ORGANIZATION>Glee Club</ORGANIZATION> has gone back and forth on whether they wanted to sing the song in a public setting even before the publication of the Rolling Stone article . 
" We only [ perform it ] once a year , by popular request - at the Rotunda Sing , " he said . 
<PERSON>Seid</PERSON> said there has been significant alumni outreach regarding ties to the song , and that many members - old and new - have said the song is not how they would like to promote the group . 
" Most of them agree with me when they say we need to be sensitive with the presentation of the song and performance of it , " <PERSON>Seid</PERSON> said . 
Correction : A previous version of this article said the song " Rugby Road " appeared in their <DATE>2010</DATE> album . 
It is instead the name of the <DATE>2010</DATE> album , but is not itself featured in the track list .
