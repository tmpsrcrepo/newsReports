In the spirit of the new school year , I thought it would be appropriate to offer up a set of resolutions for the coming year , an " agenda " of sorts , which our student leaders might heed as they govern their organizations in the coming year . 
This university is a haven , in many ways , from the turmoil that plagues the outside world , but that is not to say that the institutions that govern student life at this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> are perfect , or even close to it . 
Cracks in the surface do exist . 
One problem frequently cited is the lack of " true " student self-governance , manifested in pathetically low student participation in elections - just <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> this past <DATE>spring</DATE> - as well as unopposed elections , which are taken to symbolize student apathy . 
Everyone and his mother has heard ( and complained ) about this , from former Viewpoint Writer <PERSON>William Henagan</PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> , which blames inaction on behalf of student governance organizations , all the way to those token drunk guys in the <ORGANIZATION>Jefferson Literary & Debating Society</ORGANIZATION> kvetching on the Lawn at 3 in the <TIME>morning</TIME> . 
But what can we , as students , actually do to fix these ? 
The answer is painstakingly obvious : run for offices and vote in elections . 
This paper has pointed out that there is a high correlation between contested races and high voter turnout , and so this appears to be a relatively easy fix . 
A simple and achievable aspiration would be contested races in school-wide elections for executive-level positions in <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> , coupled with at least <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> voter turnout . 
This will put cries of " the end of student self-governance " to rest . 
Another problem requiring attention is the continuous prevalence of sexual assault , at this university and at colleges and universities around the country . 
Fortunately , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has taken numerous steps in the right direction , as of late . 
This <DATE>fall</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will launch " Not on Our Grounds , " a campaign to end sexual assault . 
In addition , <PERSON>Patricia Lampkin</PERSON> , Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer , plans to announce changes to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's strategies to combat sexual assault on <DATE>September 12</DATE> , at the next <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> meeting . 
And it 's not just the administration that has been working to address this issue . 
Student groups such as One in Four , One Less and Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> have strived for years to raise awareness , promote bystander intervention , and speak out against sexual assault . 
Recently , <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> joined them . 
In <DATE>April</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> passed the Sexual Misconduct Awareness , Recovery , and Tangible change ( SMART ) resolution , calling for increased sexual assault education , transparency from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , a student body survey and greater resources for survivors . 
It is difficult to set an appropriate goal for this delicate matter , since any sexual assault is , of course , one too many . 
But it is reasonable to hope and expect that the administration will continue its focus on sexual assault , that student groups will continue to speak out against sexual assault , and that <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> will make its resolution a reality . 
Let 's keep the dialogue going . 
And let 's make sure there 's some deliberate action behind it . 
A third and final goal concerns fraternities . 
To put it kindly , the <DATE>last two years</DATE> have not been friendly to fraternity pledging ( alternatively , fraternity pledging has not been friendly to the <DATE>last two years</DATE> ) . 
In the <DATE>spring of 2013</DATE> , pledging was cut short due to a number of incidents , and just this past <DATE>spring</DATE> , two fraternities were kicked off of campus for incidents , although one has since been brought back on appeal . 
The merits of each case , and the role of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> in taking action against fraternities , is up for debate , and I will not address it in this column . 
But I will say this : every incident in which the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> disciplines a fraternity , particularly for a hazing incident , is a black eye on the Greek system . 
In the current national climate , where fraternities seem to be in the public eye for their destructiveness instead of their immense positive effects on tens of thousands of young men , it is damaging for this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's national brand and reputation to continually discipline fraternities . 
And so the final goal of this column is for the school year to pass without a major disciplinary incident involving fraternities . 
This <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will be a happier place if we win just one conference football game ( 0-8 in conference in <DATE>2013</DATE> ) . 
But it would be happier still if we were to accomplish the goals that I have outlined above . 
Here 's to a great year .
