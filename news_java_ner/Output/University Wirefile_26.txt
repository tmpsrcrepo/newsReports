I MARCHED in the Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> rally <DATE>last Thursday</DATE> . 
No , I 'm not flaunting a new merit badge on my social consciousness , nor will I condemn sexual assault repeatedly until you stop reading . 
I really just want to share with you my thoughts during the march , and offer some suggestions for improving it in the coming year . 
Honestly , I participated primarily to be part of an organized and genuine response by the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> to assertions about our apathy towards the problem of sexual assault . 
I was elated to see so many men -- and among them many fraternity members -- present at the event . 
I continue to hope that someday such mass exposure to new viewpoints and concerns will erase the negative attitudes that perptuate abuse . 
Mindful not to fall into the throes of idealism , at the pre-march concert I assessed my own role in the rally . 
Never directly affected by sexual assault or domestic abuse , my male identity relegated me from " activist " to " spectator . " 
Still , I remained a concerned participant . 
Perhaps this results from erecting walls of my own identity when confronted by an emotional and serious topic : I can recognize the concern about sexual assault , but only so far as I recognize that , for myself , it is social , not personal . 
When the march began , the scene seemed surreal . 
Was I part of a hungry Parisian mob , determined to riot at <LOCATION>Versailles</LOCATION> ? 
Had I time-warped into <DATE>1970</DATE> , protesting <ORGANIZATION>Kent State</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> ? 
Strolling with one of my fraternity brothers to the beat of the crowd 's chants , the surrealism evaporated when , by the ice park , I saw an elderly homeless woman . 
Her smiling face beamed from her dark , dirty clothes , as her pathetic condition negated the sentimental quaintness of the Downtown Mall . 
She , like me , was a spectator , but our backgrounds were doubtlessly polar opposites . 
I only can imagine , moreover , the amount of sexual assault a poor , shelterless female potentially is subject to . 
As we marched toward Main Street , I could not erase her image from my mind . 
Then I understood that this issue , unlike nearly all others , concerns women from all segments of society -- be they a bag lady or a sorority woman . 
At this point a mother walked by me in a business suit , holding the hands of her two young daughters who confirmed this epiphany . 
With such a diverse group of activists , it is evident that sexual assault and domestic abuse are not national or political issues -- they are worldwide cultural problems . 
Along the jaunt down Main Street , the ralliers chanted a number of catchy mantras . 
The long , snakelike line of marchers created quite a spectacle , impeding traffic and turning heads . 
Female employees of Main Street merchants stepped outside to cheer . 
Such a scene forced the nearby motorists and restaurant-goers to consider -- however briefly -- the shouted chants . 
Confronting these issues hopefully increased awareness and respect for these unintentional participants . 
Regardless of any subsequent news articles -- if this were the rally 's only result -- it would have succeeded . 
As the crowd approached Grounds , it turned away from the <LOCATION>Rotunda</LOCATION> , the march 's terminus , to go down <PERSON>Madison Lane</PERSON> , the home street of six fraternities and four sororities . 
The once-varied chants melded into only one : " Hey , hey ! 
Ho , ho ! 
Date rape has got to go ! " 
I assume the intentional detour intended to target a specific audience -- fraternity men . 
The crowd essentially addressed all fraternity men , including myself , and it insinuated that fraternity men are particularly inclined to rape women . 
I disagree . 
I mentioned my displeasure to a friend on the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Sorority Council</ORGANIZATION> as I walked home , and then decided to write this column . 
If the rally 's chanters want their message to get across , they should n't imply that those they want to influence are rapists . 
On the other hand , instead of staring from their lawns and porches , the fraternity men on Madison Lane should have emptied out into the crowd , joining the march . 
Do n't worry , guys , supporting a good cause wo n't decrease your machismo . 
I 'd like to see more people from various backgrounds participate in the next Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> rally . 
And I 'd also appreciate it if the rally made itself more accommodating to people from these various backgrounds .
