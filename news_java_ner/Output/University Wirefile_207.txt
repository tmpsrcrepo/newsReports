Bright green flyers deriding the <ORGANIZATION>Jefferson Area Drug Enforcement Task Force</ORGANIZATION> as " JADED " and chalkings of marijuana leaves blanketed <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Grounds</ORGANIZATION> last <DATE>Friday</DATE> around the <PERSON>Bryan Hall</PERSON> walkway and the <ORGANIZATION>Ruffner Hall</ORGANIZATION> pedestrian bridge . 
Some of the fliers featured a large picture of the serial rapist in an attempt to argue that funds allocated for the " Operation Spring Break Down " drug bust would have been better spent finding the serial rapist , who remains at large . 
A chalking on the side of <ORGANIZATION>Ruffner Hall</ORGANIZATION> had the Web address of the <ORGANIZATION>National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws</ORGANIZATION> written below a picture of a marijuana leaf . 
Although remnants of pro-marijuana chalkings still remained on some university buildings <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , the fliers all had been removed from the <PERSON>Bryan Hall</PERSON> walkway . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Michael Coleman</PERSON> declined to comment on the anti-JADE message expressed by the fliers , but recognized the right of the individuals who posted them to spread their message . 
" What they 're talking about is entirely their opinion , " <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said . 
" This is a free country and they can say whatever they 'd like to say . " 
The majority of the students arrested as part of " Operation Spring Break Down " were indicted for marijuana possession and distribution charges . 
<PERSON>Kathy Radd</PERSON> , chair of the Alcohol and <ORGANIZATION>Drug Abuse Prevention Team</ORGANIZATION> , rejected the fliers ' message belittling the recent drug bust . 
" I do think it 's important for our police departments to try and cut down on drug use at U.Va. , " <PERSON>Radd</PERSON> said . 
" I do think it 's a good idea to try and focus their attention on dealers . " 
Similarly , other students rejected the notion that the operation was a fiscal mistake for local law enforcement . 
First-year college student <PERSON>Matt Strampe</PERSON> disagreed with the fliers ' message that money spent on the drug crackdown would have been better used tracking down the rapist . 
" As far as blaming the people that operated the drug bust for a rapist still being on the loose -- I just thought it was a little extreme and a little out there to go ahead and blame [ the drug bust ] on that , " <PERSON>Strampe</PERSON> said . 
Second-year college student <PERSON>Adam Weiss</PERSON> said he was uncertain of the cost of the drug bust versus the search for the rapist . 
" It seems that if they had been planning [ the drug bust ] for a while , not going through with it would be wasteful , " <PERSON>Weiss</PERSON> said . 
Third-year college student <PERSON>Katie Houk</PERSON> said the illegality of marijuana only leads youngsters more easily to more dangerous drugs . 
" From my personal experience at U.Va. , kids try illegal things all the time , " she said . 
" I think making marijuana illegal does not prevent kids from trying it . 
By making marijuana illegal you 're forcing kids to go to drug dealers and then the temptation is to try more hardcore kinds of drugs . " 
Second-year Engineering student <PERSON>Ewen Cheslack-Postava</PERSON> , however , said he agrees with <ORGANIZATION>JADE</ORGANIZATION> 's efforts to limit drug use , but does n't think the recent drug bust was the best way to accomplish that goal . 
" I do n't know what to say besides that [ the posters ] are right , " <PERSON>Cheslack-Postava</PERSON> said . 
" Money spent on drug enforcement does n't even have to go towards the crime fighting that it 's geared to . 
Give some money to schools to educate children on the risks " of drug use .
