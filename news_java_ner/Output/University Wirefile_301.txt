Community " to explain the different roles these organizations play in undergraduate life . 
<ORGANIZATION>UJC Chair Raleigh Anne Blank</ORGANIZATION> said that this year the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> emphasized involvement within the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> community and the need for each student to maximize all four years of attendance . 
While the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> deals specifically with instances of cheating , lying and stealing , the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> hears cases involving 12 specific standards of conduct .

The only penalty for being found guilty of an Honor offense is expulsion .

Watson dorm senior resident <PERSON>Janet Partlow</PERSON> said first years seemed confused about the differences between student government groups before attending the programs . 
" I think that 's a good chance for them to learn some more basic stuff about what their role is in the honor system and what happens if <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> needs to be involved in something , " <PERSON>Partlow</PERSON> said " I think their goal is just to make sure students understand [ the differences between the groups ] . "
