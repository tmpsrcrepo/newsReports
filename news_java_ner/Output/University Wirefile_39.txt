While there are several reasons why a victim might not report a rape to authorities , one of the main factors in not reporting the crime is the different perceptions of what constitutes rape . 
Members within the sexual assault outreach community feel that some women might not hold a properly defined notion of what rape really means . 
" Some women do n't have a clear concept of what rape is , " Women 's Center Project Coordinator <PERSON>Zena Pedonoma</PERSON> said . 
Dean of Students <PERSON>Robert T. Canevari</PERSON> explained that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> uses the same definition of rape as the state 's criminal code . 
The code states " if any person has sexual intercourse with a complaining witness who is not his or her spouse or causes a complaining witness to engage in sexual intercourse with any other person and such act is accomplished against the complaining witness 's will , by force , threat , or intimidation ... or through the use of the complaining witness 's mental incapacity or physical helplessness " the person is guilty of rape . 
But <PERSON>Canevari</PERSON> said some women do not know whether an unwanted sexual encounter , not necessarily sexual intercourse , constitutes rape . 
" There are women out there who do n't know the definitions and who maybe are too accepting of a situation , " he said . 
Even when a woman knows she was raped , she may blame herself for an unwanted act , which results in her silence . 
A woman might blame herself on the basis of her clothing or the way she interacts with a man . 
" Many women feel they did something to provoke it by dressing a certain way or acting in a certain manner , " first-year student <PERSON>Bianca White</PERSON> said . 
" I have n't talked to a woman yet who does n't blame herself in some way for what happened , " said <PERSON>Cindy Lamm</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Resource Agency</ORGANIZATION> associate director . 
Perceptions of rape also can change drastically when the rapist is a date or an acquaintance . 
<PERSON>Dustin Burke</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Facts and Education</ORGANIZATION> president , said in some cases a woman may start out wanting to have sex , but decide not to later on in the date . 
" Sometimes there is a change of mind half-way through the date , " <PERSON>Burke</PERSON> said , resulting in the woman feeling that she was to blame for misleading the man . 
The issue of drinking also blurs an already fuzzy boundary of sexual assault . 
<PERSON>Burke</PERSON> said " drinking exacerbates the circumstances " of sexual assault . 
Canevari said parties that involve alcohol can contribute to differing perceptions of rape . 
" Most of those party scenes can get pretty crazy , " he said . 
" Some men do n't understand what they 're doing and that what they did was rape . " 
He added that although both male and female <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students are more educated now about rape than they were 10 to 15 years ago , " there 's still work that needs to be done . " 
Pedonoma agreed that education is a key factor in both preventing and reporting assaults . 
She said one reason for the occurrence of rape is that both women and men sometimes lack knowledge about rape and their options in the event of an assault . 
" There are a lot of people that do n't know their rights , " <PERSON>Pedonoma</PERSON> said . 
Canevari said some <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> programs have been helping to educate students about their rights and about how to change a bad situation to a less dangerous one . 
He said the Grounds for Discussion program for first-year students during orientation is one example of a program that educates students on how to prevent sexual assault , by showing both a male and female making safe decisions in a date rape scenario . 
Canevari also praised the efforts of fraternities and sororities to provide personal safety programs , as well as informal conversations in residence halls about sexual assault , which he has heard about from residents and Resident Assistants . 
Other than not having clear understanding of what constitutes an assault , another reason for the small number of reported rapes could be women 's lack of confidence in authorities . 
Many women might see the process of reporting a rape as a greater ordeal than the rape itself . 
" The drawn-out process involved after a rape can make it more difficult for the victim to put it in her past , " <PERSON>Burke</PERSON> said . 
Women may even be afraid of others ' reactions . 
" A woman may feel no one will believe her , " <PERSON>Burke</PERSON> said .
