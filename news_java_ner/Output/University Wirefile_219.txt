Last <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , former President <PERSON>George H. W. Bush</PERSON> broadsided his son 's critics . 
Speaking at an oil industry group 's annual meeting , <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> called denial of progress in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> " deeply offensive and contemptible . " 
" There is something ignorant , " he said , " in the way they dismiss the overthrow of a brutal dictator and the sowing of seeds of basic human freedom in that troubled part of the world . " 
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> called the past year of Iraqi history a " miracle . " 
Several hours later , Iraqi militants killed four American civilians . 
A jubilant crowd mutilated the four charred bodies , dragged two of them through the streets of <LOCATION>Fallujah</LOCATION> and hung them from a bridge that spans the <LOCATION>Euphrates</LOCATION> . 
Our current president has spoken of a clear moral agenda of democratic miracle-working to bring peace , democracy and prosperity to the world . 
And while all must dedicate themselves to this noble vision , the president 's ( and most other presidents ' ) version has one large problem : It does n't include most of the world . 
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has made a policy of treating tiny portions of a very sick human society , destroying our credibility to ever adopt a humanitarianism outside of our own interests and exact a dedicated , holistic vision . 
President <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON> and the high-level ideologues he imported to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> have dreamed of miracles in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> since they took office , even ( according to <PERSON>Richard A. Clarke</PERSON> ) as rescuers pulled charred remains from the rubble of the World Trade Center on <DATE>Sept. 12 , 2001</DATE> . 
The current administration gives strong rhetorical support to freedom around the globe and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's willingness to take action for it . 
The president said on <DATE>Feb. 17</DATE> , " Building democracies in nations that have endured decades of tyranny will require the kind of sustained commitment that won the Cold War . 
We accept that duty . 
We accept that duty in our time because it is right . " 
The jury remains out on what will become of <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> . 
The rest of " that troubled part of the world , " however , disappoints . 
As ex-CIA analyst <PERSON>Robert Baer</PERSON> has pointed out , <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> is quickly crumbling and may not be reforming its government , economy and relationship with the <ORGANIZATION>United States</ORGANIZATION> fast enough to stem the twin forces of poverty and radical Islam . 
In <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> , which the <ORGANIZATION>United States</ORGANIZATION> invaded in <DATE>2001</DATE> , <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid and troop presence runs scanter than in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> , which has fewer people and more money . 
Warlords and <ORGANIZATION>Taliban</ORGANIZATION> still roam the countryside while the U.S.-sponsored government clings to power . 
But more important than whether <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is achieving an ideal vision in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> ( and why he has selectively applied his principles even there ) is how such a seemingly broad-reaching moral vision manages to apply mostly to one region . 
His silence on the increasingly strong-armed <PERSON>Vladimir Putin</PERSON> is shocking . 
And it is frightening that <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> , moral convictions and all , remains silent on people like <PERSON>Jean-Pierre Bemba</PERSON> . 
In late 2002 , <PERSON>Bemba</PERSON> 's rebel movement ( in the northeast Democratic Republic of the <LOCATION>Congo</LOCATION> ) executed a campaign called " Clean the Slate , " designed to terrorize the population with ethnic cleansing and widespread rape . 
Most famously , <PERSON>Bemba</PERSON> 's men cannibalized civilian victims . 
The country 's adopted peace plan has since made him a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>DRC</ORGANIZATION> . 
So where is our commitment to the <ORGANIZATION>DRC</ORGANIZATION> ? 
What about <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Haiti</LOCATION> ? 
In all kinds of developing nations , billions of people live in severe material deprivation , have little hope for the future and enjoy no freedom to determine their life 's course . 
Does n't <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's moral vision include them ? 
Our nation suffers from a severe myopia that the political system does nothing to challenge . 
We can not recognize that in the grand scheme , one toppled dictator is a drop in a sea of unjust misery . 
We must envision the liberation of billions , not change one regime and declare the world a much better place . 
The needs of the world and dictates of our rhetoric demand much more than that , but we can not see tragedy outside the bounds of our calculated interest . 
Many falsely believe that cycles of our own war-and-liberation heroism can remake the world . 
But we ca n't invade every oppressed nation , and <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> has destroyed our integrity to lead a concerted effort at the wide-reaching reforms that are needed . 
After the war in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> , millions would maim our burnt flesh in the streets before they would follow us to a better world . 
In the end , the limits and insincerities of our " miracles " doom the prospect of vast and real ones . 
We have our regions , and we have our aspirations . 
We have our scope of vision . 
And the world should be happy , because things are going well .
