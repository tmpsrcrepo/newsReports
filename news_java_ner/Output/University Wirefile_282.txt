LAST FRIDAY , <ORGANIZATION>The Daily Progress</ORGANIZATION> reported that a group of students is " working with <ORGANIZATION>University Law</ORGANIZATION> professors and administrators to craft a change " that will " standardize " <ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> sanctions against students found guilty of hate-motivated violations . 
This group ( of four students ) also wants to add a " 13th tenet to the Standards of Conduct , " specifically addressing verbal harassment . 
The recent spur of racial incidents has left our student body undeniably mired in a state of malaise . 
However , aggression against the First Amendment , no matter how subtle , is a misdirected and superficial response . 
Historically , such campus speech codes have not faired well in court . 
In <DATE>1988</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>the University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> faced several racial incidents , particularly the dispersion of a flyer that declared " open season " on blacks . 
In reaction , <ORGANIZATION>UM</ORGANIZATION> passed a policy which prohibited any speech which " creates an intimidating , hostile , or demeaning environment for educational pursuits , employment or participation in <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> sponsored ... activities . " 
One year later , this policy was struck down by a federal court decision , <ORGANIZATION>John Doe v. University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> , which wisely asserted that " while the court is sympathetic to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's obligation to ensure equal educational opportunities for all of its students , such efforts must not be done at the expense of free speech . " 
While <PERSON>Rami Samo</PERSON> , one of the four students involved , defended her group 's work as " the most viable solution , " it is not clear that this is true . 
First of all , restricting free speech will likely hurt the long-run promotion of diversity . 
Simply because people can not articulate their bigoted viewpoints does not mean that they will lose those ideas -- instead , they will articulate them in secrecy , where unreasonable arguments are best received . 
By contrast , if all speech were openly promoted , even racist speech , then such speech can be openly combated with more reasonable ideas . 
Simply put , ignorant speech creates a reaction of better speech . 
Therefore , it seems diversity is best served in an open-market of expression . 
The <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION> , recognizing this , has a long history of working with the <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> ) on free speech cases . 
Second , this group of four has not considered the details of racial incidents here at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
If the attackers of <PERSON>Daisy Lundy</PERSON> ( a biracial president three years ago ) were caught today , they could easily be charged with assault . 
Strengthening the sanction for crimes motivated by hate has a weak underlying logic . 
We should not set a precedent of punishing people because of their beliefs , no matter how ridiculous those beliefs are . 
If an environmentalist student assaults an SUV driver because he absolutely hates SUV drivers , it seems intuitively wrong to punish the environmentalist more simply because of his beliefs . 
It is the assault , not the underlying belief ( no matter how ridiculous ) that should be punished . 
Seen in this light , punishing more strictly because of an individual 's belief is undoubtedly a violation of the First Amendment . 
Furthermore , regardless of individual opinions on affirmative action or how to deal with racism , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has clearly and proudly demonstrated that it has a broad support for diversity and the creation of an inclusive , comfortable community . 
Therefore , if a student is seen placing hateful flyers around Grounds , that student will receive considerable social sanctions . 
News of his identity will spread , and he or she will face considerable social pressure -- organizations would shun him or her , clubs would not want him or her , fewer people will be willing to date him or her , etc . 
Punishing him on account of opinions , no matter how bigoted or bothersome , displays an unfortunate unfamiliarity with and an unacceptable departure from contemporary Anglo-American legal principles.And finally , even if we were content to hamper free speech in universities , areas specifically designed to encourage the free flow of ideas , one has to wonder if it would even be enforced in legitimately racially motivated cases . 
None of the perpetrators of racial crimes earlier this semester has been identified , and it does not seem as though they ever will be . 
Instead , the amendment will probably result in a wave of superfluous <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> trials . 
While it is difficult to put forth any sort of comprehensive defense of ( all ) free speech in a 700 word column , an attempt is absolutely imperative . 
Seventeen years ago , <ORGANIZATION>the University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> was in a tight situation and they folded , abdicating their allegiance to the constitution . 
This year , our beloved <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is in danger of repeating their mistake . 
The crafters of these amendments to <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> policies should realize the value of free speech to promoting diversity and discontinue their efforts , which condescendingly display distrust in our community 's willingness to combat racism without trampling on the Constitution 's first and arguably most important amendment . 
However , if they pursue their assault on the First Amendment , I hope dearly that our student body will be wise enough to reject their inefficacious and ultimately un-American disregard for the Constitution .
