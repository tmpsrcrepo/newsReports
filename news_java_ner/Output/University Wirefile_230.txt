The career of <PERSON>Bill O'Reilly</PERSON> , the hugely popular talking head with <ORGANIZATION>Fox News</ORGANIZATION> , was plunged into scandal last week . 
Following allegations of sexual harassment from a coworker , many are wondering how <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> , known for his moral crusades against Internet pornography and sex in the media , could engage in such questionable behavior . 
The key to understanding <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> is not his television career , but his lesser-known career as a prolific author -- of everything from children 's books to a suspense novel . 
O'Reilly 's novel , " Those Who Trespass , " is a particularly tantalizing read , containing passages like , " [ <PERSON>Ashley</PERSON> ] signaled her desire by removing her shirt and skirt ... " ending in a way that would be unsuitable to publish in such a respected newspaper . 
Though all of <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> 's books read as if they were written by a peevish pre-teenager , his newest is actually aimed at that demographic , " The O'Reilly Factor for Kids " -- a self-described " survival guide for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's families . " 
The lucky kids in possession of this handy parenting-substitute are treated to a special chapter on sex on page 72 . 
Sprinkled among <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> 's endorsements of casual sex ( " As you will learn yourself after a couple of casual sexual experiences ... " ) is valuable advice on concealing sexual activity . 
O'Reilly sums up the most important advice of his book in an appendix formatted as a super-cool chat-room conversation . 
" A pinhead , " he says " is a kid who brags about her sex life . 
I 've warned you about this ... it 's stupid , it 's a betrayal ... it 's wrong . " 
So <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> 's message to kids is not " do n't engage in gratuitous extra-marital sex " ; it 's " when you do , do n't tell anybody . " 
O'Reilly 's talk about sex , clearly aimed at the pre-teen audience , seems less characteristic of a caring father than a creepy child molester . 
Unfortunately , for <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> , not everyone got his instant message . 
O'Reilly has been hit with a harassment lawsuit , alleging intimidation , as well as , among other things , talk of masturbation , vibrators and other lewd sexual fantasies that sound as if they were lifted right out of his bad novel . 
As a conservative , I 'm a fan of many conservative commentators on cable news . 
<PERSON>Bill O'Reilly</PERSON> was never one of them . 
My distaste for <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> has little to do with his confrontational-crazed-maniac method of interrogating guests , rather that he seems to be infused with phoniness . 
As the host of the highest rated news program in the country , it makes little sense that <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> suffers from an inferiority complex . 
But that 's the impression he projects into millions of homes every weeknight . 
After these allegations , I finally know why for so long <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> has seemed uncomfortable in his own skin . 
It must be hard to loudly decry sexual immorality , on television and in a book subtitled " A survival guide for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's families , " when one is engaging in tape-recorded kinky phone sex , and bragging about having causal sex with foreign women and " girls , " with a pregnant wife at home . 
One would think that if someone leveled baseless accusations against O'Reilly , he would be on television instantly denouncing them as liars , but he has done no such thing . 
In fact , his lawyers only contend that nothing illegal took place . 
Illegal ? 
If the acts were consensual , then no . 
But was it stupid , a betrayal and wrong ? 
Absolutely . 
The real victims of the <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> saga are the thousands of kids whose admiring letters feature prominently in <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> 's book . 
They , along with much of the rest of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , bought into <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> 's duplicitous sham . 
O'Reilly claims to be a bulwark against the immorality of Hollywood and television actors . 
As it turns out , <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> himself is an actor , playing a positive role model at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> on weeknights . 
For years , <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> has made millions selling morality to an audience so starved for wholesomeness that they ca n't tell the difference between the real thing and a knock-off . 
Like any product , when you discover it 's defective , you demand a refund . 
Though <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> is unlikely to relinquish his fortune , he should do the next best thing : sincerely apologize for the hypocrisy and step down from television .
