Headlines scream the lastest news from <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Military Institute</ORGANIZATION> 's struggle to co-educate . 
The silver screen lights up as a bruised and battered <PERSON>Demi Moore</PERSON> sports a shaved head and fatigues . 
While the issue of women in the military continues to spark debate across the nation , gender plays a lesser role in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's ROTC program . 
The sun was still low in the horizon when army cadets began their descent off the 50-foot " bunny slope " at <ORGANIZATION>Raven</ORGANIZATION> 's Roost , located on the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Ridge Parkway</ORGANIZATION> . 
An hour later , the cadets were tackling a 60-foot vertical rock while upperclassmen barked out commands , addressing the uniformed figures by their last names . 
" We treat everybody fairly based on their year , their rank and just the quality of the cadet , " said Lt. <PERSON>Thomas James</PERSON> , a first-year instructor and <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> group advisor . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> offers <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> and Marine ROTC programs . 
Although the individual <ORGANIZATION>ROTC</ORGANIZATION> programs each are structured differently , the program basically consists of military training during undergraduate years in which the <ORGANIZATION>ROTC</ORGANIZATION> foots the bill for portions of tuition and other expenses in exchange for a student 's commitment to military service after graduation . 
While men still dominate the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's ROTC programs , each boasts female participation rates higher than national averages . 
" Our women do very well , " said Lieutenant Colonel <PERSON>John Dean</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> ROTC program commander and military science professor . 
Women said they join the <ORGANIZATION>ROTC</ORGANIZATION> program for a variety of reasons ; many are interested in the scholarship and job opportunities , while others come from military families . 
" I always liked teamwork , discipline and excellence , " said <ORGANIZATION>Airforce</ORGANIZATION> Wing Commander <PERSON>Amy Thibodeau</PERSON> , a fourth-year College student . 
" The military strives for all of these things . 
" I knew that I would be with motivated people working for a common mission , and a very worthwhile mission , " <PERSON>Thibodeau</PERSON> said . 
New opportunities for women in the military have increased the number of women who choose to enter the field . 
" When I was a cadet here , the main difference was that you knew up front that women could n't become fighter pilots and so most of the pilot candidates were male , " said Captain <PERSON>Anne Marie Gilliam</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> ROTC air science assistant professor . 
" That 's not the case anymore because those restrictions have been taken away . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>Air Force ROTC</ORGANIZATION> detachment consists of <PERCENT>42 percent</PERCENT> women -- <PERCENT>25.3 percent</PERCENT> higher than the national average -- making it the highest female participation of <ORGANIZATION>University ROTC</ORGANIZATION> programs , with about 45 women enrolled . 
Women account for <PERCENT>36 percent</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> program ( a total of 23 ) and <PERCENT>18 percent</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> program ( a total of 22 ) . 
" It was probably one of the most worthwhile things that I think I 've ever done , " Lt. <PERSON>Tina Blain</PERSON> , Gold Bar Recruiter and <DATE>1996</DATE> College graduate , said of her years with the <ORGANIZATION>Army ROTC</ORGANIZATION> . 
As a Gold Bar recruiter , <PERSON>Blain</PERSON> visits different schools and events to recruit young people for the ROTC program . 
The program trains students to be second lieutenants in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> -- a position symbolized by a gold bar worn on the uniform . 
<PERSON>Blain</PERSON> was the only woman in her class . 
" I did everything they did . 
I was never excluded out of anything , " she said . 
But while the <ORGANIZATION>University ROTC</ORGANIZATION> programs provide an equal experience for students , women serving in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Armed Forces still are not on completely equal footing . 
In the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> , women are prevented from duty on submarines . 
Federal government regulations also bar <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> women from serving in the infantry and armored divisions . 
But few women involved in a <ORGANIZATION>University ROTC</ORGANIZATION> program said their experiences were different from those of their male counterparts . 
" I do n't even think about it . 
Everyone 's in uniform , evrybody 's the same , " said <PERSON>Mark Rogers</PERSON> , fourth-year College student and Batalionist S-3 . 
" That 's the point of the uniform . " 
" Our women do the same training program as the men , " said Lt. Colonel Dean . 
" There 's only one factor that sets them apart from the men , in terms of the training program , and that 's the physical fitness standards . 
Because of the women 's physiology differences , the army recognizes a different army physical fitness standard . 
But in the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> ROTC program , the detachment decided to give out awards for their semester Physical Readiness Test ( PRT ) without regard to gender . 
" Some of the people in the battalion were thinking that none of the girls wold get the awards , " said Midshipman 2nd class <PERSON>Shannon VanderPas</PERSON> , a third-year College student . 
As it turned out , three of seven midshipmen awarded last semester were women who received perfect scores . 
Despite some bad publicity in recent years about sexual harassment in the militrary , many <ORGANIZATION>University ROTC</ORGANIZATION> women said they have not encountered any such problems . 
" We do n't tolerate anything like that . 
We never have , we never will , and I think that 's instilled in the cadet system , " <PERSON>Thibodeau</PERSON> said . 
" It 's not something we even have to address . 
When the cadets come in they see women in the high positions and men in the high positions of different races of diferent genders . 
I do n't think it 's even an issue in our detachment . " 
Because of the high percentage of women in the <ORGANIZATION>University ROTC</ORGANIZATION> programs , many women said they do n't encounter the problems associated with being the only woman in a group of men . 
But during <DATE>summer</DATE> training activities , when <ORGANIZATION>University ROTC</ORGANIZATION> students are taken away from Grounds , the story sometimes takes a different twist . 
When <PERSON>Thibodeau</PERSON> attended field training between her second and third years , she encountered <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Military Institute</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Citadel</ORGANIZATION> men who , at the time , never had worked with female colleagues . 
" For some of them it was hard to deal with us , " she said . 
" But they learn [ to ] drop their attitudes , which is good . " 
VanderPas was placed on a <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> ship with 800 men and 23 women during the <DATE>summer</DATE> training cruise she took between her second and <DATE>third years</DATE> . 
" At first it was weird , " she said . 
But she said she did n't encounter any negative feelings while she was on the ship . 
" Younger officers do n't have that mindset at all , " she addded . 
When <PERSON>Blain</PERSON> attended the five-week advanced camp required by the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> between her third and fourth years , it was the first year the camp integrated the barracks . 
Of the 44 cadets in the platoon , eight were women . 
Only a curtain separated the male and female quarters . 
To prevent any embarrassing moments dealing with the one bathroom for the barracks , a sign was placed on the door indicating occupancy by a woman or man . 
But this delicate situation did n't pose any problems , in <LOCATION>Blain</LOCATION> 's opinion . 
" Everyone was very respectful of each other . 
It was easier to get things done because we were all in the barracks , " she said . 
For some of the women in <ORGANIZATION>ROTC</ORGANIZATION> , there is an extra push for excellence , coming from the need to uphold the position of women in the military . 
Many feel they must prove themselves , knowing they are blazing tough trails for future women in the military . 
" Personally , for me it 's something I 'm constantly thinking about , " said Midshipman 1st Class <PERSON>Abigail Callanta</PERSON> , a fourth-year Nursing student . 
But many such women say this pressure is lessened by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's more accepting atmosphere . 
Proving oneself simply becomes a matter of action , not gender . 
" In order to get respect from people you have to comport yourself in a respectable manner , " <PERSON>VanderPas</PERSON> said . 
" That 's the same for guys and girls . "
