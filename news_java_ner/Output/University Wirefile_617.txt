One of the most important things about the information we get from a news article is where that information comes from . 
The Cavalier Daily reporters do n't always do a good job of explaining their sources and in many cases simply do n't use enough sources or the right kinds of sources to give readers a complete picture . 
I 'll use recently published news pieces to illustrate the kinds of problems I think The Cavalier Daily runs into in its news reporting . 
Some articles do n't have enough sources . 
In an article about the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> considering a bill that would alter how sexual assault allegations are handled on college campuses , the position of supporters of the bill is described without attribution . 
The position of opponents of the bill is described and then extensively explained by the only person to be quoted in the article . 
I agree with one commenter online that the article ends up reading like an opinion piece instead of a news article . 
It effectively presents one side of an issue as true because it is being reported as news . 
Similarly , some articles have effective sources for some information and then fall off in other parts . 
For example , in an otherwise interesting ( and really well-conceived ) article comparing fraternity party rules at four other universities there is a discrepancy about the information the reader is given about those other schools . 
In two cases there are quotations from administrators at those schools responsible for fraternity rules while for the other two schools we 're offered nothing but a summary of rules without attribution . 
I was left wondering why there were n't quotations in those spots and what someone from the school might have said about their rules . 
It 's a well-done article in parts but it does n't seem like something that was so time sensitive it needed to be published before getting some comments about the other two schools . 
I will , though , note the effective use of links in the lede of the article . 
I 'd very much like to see more of this as a reader ; it was simple to click over and refresh my memory of what the new rules at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> entail . 
Then there are articles that either do n't seem to have appropriate sources or do n't have sources appropriately explained or described for the reader . 
In a piece on the rejection of gun control legislation in the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia State Senate</ORGANIZATION> the only sources are two <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> undergraduate students . 
The College Republicans Chairman and <ORGANIZATION>the University Democrats Financial Officer</ORGANIZATION> are quoted ( with the same political platitudes we hear from , it seems , all political spokespersons ) . 
Why look to these students for information about the bills apart from their choice to engage in politics ? 
With an absence of sources that have substantial information to offer , there is n't much to learn from this article beyond the headline . 
In another article about legislation currently being considered in the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia State Senate</ORGANIZATION> the reporter included quotations from the sponsoring Senator and from the spokesperson for the Speaker of the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia House of Delegates</ORGANIZATION> . 
The latter piece gave the reader a much clearer understanding of the landscape in which the legislation is being considered and because the sources are involved in it , better reason to think the information is good and accurate . 
Sometimes the sources are good but need further explanation or description . 
In a report about resolutions for a constitutional convention all of the sources seem like good ones but two are lacking in description that would help the reader assess the information they offer . 
<PERSON>Robert Kelly</PERSON> is described as " General Counsel , " but we are not told of what and <PERSON>Batten</PERSON> Professor <PERSON>Jim Savage</PERSON> is described simply as " Batten Professor . " 
Some information about his areas of expertise makes all the difference in judging what he 's saying . 
It is important to remember that not all readers of The Cavalier Daily will know the <ORGANIZATION>Batten School</ORGANIZATION> is the <ORGANIZATION>School of Leadership and Public Policy</ORGANIZATION> and even if they do , it is not a given that all faculty there would make sense as a source in an article about a possible constitutional convention . 
These issues do n't exist in all of the articles in The Cavalier Daily by any stretch but they come up repeatedly . 
There are many articles that are quite well done , for example , the piece on <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Commonwealth University</ORGANIZATION> dropping the SAT as an application requirement for many students makes excellent use of sources to offer the reader a range of information . 
This sort of reporting better serves readers . 
When sources are appropriate to the kind of information they offer and when those sources are effectively described readers can better assess the information reported .
