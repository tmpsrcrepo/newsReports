After making a splash last <DATE>May</DATE> with a controversial speech about the problems facing many African-Americans , <PERSON>Bill Cosby</PERSON> 's moral authority and credibility are now tarnished by allegations of sexual misconduct -- one from <DATE>thirty years ago</DATE> . 
Even if proven true , which I hope they are not , the accusations should not undermine Cosby 's cause . 
Rather , they are a sad reminder that in our society , those who do n't like a message will not think twice about shooting the messenger . 
Some time after <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON> was assassinated , public figures ' sex lives became fair game for character assassination plots . 
Although the press never bothered <ORGANIZATION>JFK</ORGANIZATION> about his now well-documented sexual exploits , we have since seen both the left and the right try to bring down each other 's leaders with charges of sexual misconduct , whether true or not . 
As a Republican , I will be the first to admit that the investigation into <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> 's sex life was politically motivated . 
On the other hand , I also suspect that the recent allegations of sexual harassment against conservative commentator <PERSON>Bill O'Reilly</PERSON> ( which his accuser dropped in a settlement disclaiming all wrongdoing by <PERSON>O'Reilly</PERSON> ) were a partisan hatchet job . 
And let 's not forget the sexual misconduct charges against conservative <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON>Clarence Thomas</PERSON> , which he called a " high-tech lynching . " 
Of course , racists in the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> also tried to tarnish <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> , Jr. by alleging he was unfaithful to his wife . 
Last year , liberal cartoonist <PERSON>Aaron McGruder</PERSON> even tried to impugn now <ORGANIZATION>Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice</ORGANIZATION> 's sex life , or lack thereof , in his " Boondocks " comic strip . 
If the tack against male public figures is to libel their libido , <PERSON>McGruder</PERSON> must have figured ( stupidly ) that the weapon against women is to condemn their chastity . 
Go figure . 
As for <PERSON>Bill Cosby</PERSON> , this is not the first time he has faced such ugly allegations . 
A few years ago , a young woman was sentenced to more than two years in prison for trying to extort money from Cosby , claiming she was his illegitimate daughter . 
True enough , Cosby hadan affair with the woman 's mother , but the claim that <PERSON>Cosby</PERSON> was the woman 's deadbeat dad was discredited . 
Even if <ORGANIZATION>Cosby</ORGANIZATION> 's personal lapses are proven , he is still a great American who has done great work , and he should not be judged by a different standard than other prominent leaders with similar problems , such as <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> . 
As the creator and star of the <DATE>1980s</DATE> " Cosby Show , " <PERSON>Bill Cosby</PERSON> dispelled prior media caricatures of African-Americans as frivolous and ignorant in shows like " Amos 'n Andy . " 
Not only that , but he tried , unsuccessfully , to preempt the portrayals of violence and irresponsibility in " gangsta rap " and hip-hop that would follow . 
Instead , Cosby presented to the nation a wholesome picture of the ideal , stable , loving , two-parent African-American family . 
Recently , <PERSON>Cosby</PERSON> has been attacked for his speeches urging African-Americans to take greater responsibility for the problems of poverty that disproportionately affect them . 
In last <DATE>May</DATE> 's speech before the <ORGANIZATION>NAACP</ORGANIZATION> , Cosby criticized many African-Americans for using improper grammar and not looking after their children . 
Critics claimed Cosby was out of touch -- blaming African-Americans for the effects of systemic racism . 
Many believed Cosby was underscoring a split within the African-American community that would be exploited by whites ( a claim that is unfortunately familiar here at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> ) . 
Some even called Cosby a puppet of white conservatives . 
If Cosby is a puppet , his critics have an obligation to say specifically who is pulling the strings , and how . 
The truth is , since <PERSON>Booker T. Washington</PERSON> , <PERSON>W.E.B. DuBois</PERSON> , Dr. <PERSON>King</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stokely Carmichael</PERSON> , African-Americans have been debating the issues that Cosby has underscored . 
Not only that , but one can find similarities between <PERSON>Cosby</PERSON> 's message of personal responsibility and those advanced by such diverse figures as Malcolm X and <PERSON>Louis Farrakhan</PERSON> . 
This is not a dialogue African-Americans should be ashamed of or shy away from . 
Moreover , " outsiders " who show a genuine , good-faith concern about this issue should not be cast off as " interlopers , " or kicked out of discussions simply because they are not black . 
<PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> stood with <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> during the Monica Lewinsky scandal . 
He asked his supporters to stand with him when he admitted he fathered an illegitimate daughter and paid <MONEY>$ 40,000</MONEY> in hush money from his tax-exempt charity . 
If we continue to respect <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> despite their personal lapses , we should stand with <PERSON>Bill Cosby</PERSON> , whether or not we like his message .
