A new buzzword has emerged on the pages of major publications from <ORGANIZATION>The New York Times</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Vogue</LOCATION> to describe the divide between a variety of culturally hegemonic groups and their corresponding minority groups in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
An " empathy gap " is the term being used to describe the unbridged distance between races , socioeconomic strata and gender identities everywhere from rural <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Midtown Manhattan</LOCATION> . 
I argued last week this empathy gap exists between the refugee community in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> and the student body at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> - a specific example indicative of the even more problematic divide between the black and white communities in the city . 
However , my column failed to raise a critical question I have been grappling with for months : what group of students at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> is best equipped to bridge this gap ? 
And if , as a white student , that group does n't include me , how can I be the best ally possible to students leading that charge ? 
Recently , I have found myself at a loss for pragmatic steps forward . 
Last month , I stood in front of a group of 40 high school juniors and answered questions about student life at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Their questions about classes and roommate selection skirted around any inquiries of substance , making it all too easy to stand in front of them and spout off anecdotes about my time as a student . 
I recounted some of my best memories of my time both in and out of class . 
However , halfway through the Q&A session , a black student in the back corner who I had yet to notice raised his hand and quietly asked about safety on Grounds in light of " recent events . " 
I stood there flummoxed , realizing I had talked for roughly 30 minutes without addressing some of the most pressing concerns of the only black prospective student in the room . 
I subsequently told the students what I have told many assorted groups of parents and teens over the course of the semester . 
I said first and foremost that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is not a perfect place . 
I told them these problems are endemic across college campuses and cities nationwide , but that does n't excuse the instances of sexual assault and police brutality at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
I said we welcome the media attention because it allows us to step into the national spotlight to make meaningful change . 
As I turned back to the student , I realized I had not gotten to the heart of his question : As a black male , would he be safe at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> ? 
While I wanted to answer in the affirmative , I was n't sure I could . 
Ultimately , I left it at that , moving on to a student in the front row 's question about Greek life . 
But I 've since thought about that moment , and my inadequate response . 
I thought of it at the rally for <ORGANIZATION>Martese Johnson</ORGANIZATION> later that night , when a student speaking was interrupted and told the space was reserved for " black bodies and black voices only . " 
Though the student was subsequently invited back to the microphone by those who disagreed with the interruption , the comment is reflective of a sentiment shared by many at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , and I heard similar comments from black students throughout the week . 
In my opinion , their comments are completely valid ( though they do not need my validation ) . 
I can not begin to empathize with the microaggressions felt daily by black students at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Nonetheless , these comments leave me questioning my role as an ally to marginalized communities . 
Though I recognize my inherent inadequacy in addressing those concerns - for I speak from a place of the deepest sympathy , but not of empathy - I want to be an effective representative of all members of the student body when I speak to prospective students about enrolling . 
Addressing minority students ' concerns about attending the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> can not be a job for only the minority community . 
This week , the <ORGANIZATION>Black Student Alliance</ORGANIZATION> , in accordance with 30 other organizations , released a proposal of pragmatic solutions to change the discriminatory climate of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> by " eliminating abuses " through policy solutions and creating a " culture of truth " throughout the student body . 
Their recommendations on creating the latter are compelling and I believe they are concerted steps towards bridging the empathy gap at U.Va . 
Specifically , I believe the proposal 's recommendations on potential class requirements , orientation training on cultural sensitivity and <ORGANIZATION>Residence Life</ORGANIZATION> programming are a step in the right direction to educate students on the complicated history , and current climate , of race relations at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
These programs would encourage students to think critically about both their conduct and role as allies to address concerns and challenges the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> still faces . 
However , if I could add my own personal addendum to the recommendations , I would encourage the <ORGANIZATION>Black Student Alliance</ORGANIZATION> to consider the efficacy of adding a peer education component to their proposal . 
Student-led groups such as One in Four , One Less , ADAPT , the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Peer Health Educators</ORGANIZATION> rigorously train members to effectively give presentations on their organizations ' missions to student groups and incoming first-years . 
Similarly , I feel training peer-education teams - comprised of students from all backgrounds and demographics committed to eliminating racial discrimination - to speak to student groups would ultimately be more effective than an administrator or professor leading the discussion and would allow students like me a space to be an effective ally to the minority community .
