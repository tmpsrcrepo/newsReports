<PERSON>Porter Dickie</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily Student Council</ORGANIZATION> met <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to hear from leaders of sexual violence prevention coalition and from <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Students Allen Groves</ORGANIZATION> . 
Groves addressed the disappearance of second-year College student <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> , outlining the involvement of the <LOCATION>Charlottesville Police</LOCATION> and more recently the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We have a lot of people focused on this , " <PERSON>Groves</PERSON> said . 
" It 's a very challenging time [ and ] a very concerning set of facts . 
There 's no easy way around that . 
[ We ] hope it will take a positive turn . " 
Groves said it would be up to the second-year class and not the Office of the <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Students</ORGANIZATION> to plan a vigil or a similar event . 
" It is [ up ] to the students to decide how it should happen , " he said . 
Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition</ORGANIZATION> also addressed the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> . 
The group , formerly known as the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Leadership Council</ORGANIZATION> , leads the " Hoos Got Your Back " campaign and includes ADAPT , One Less , One in Four , <ORGANIZATION>Peer Health Educators and Feminism</ORGANIZATION> is For Everyone . 
Coalition Chair <PERSON>Sara Surface</PERSON> , a third-year College student , said the organization is working toward greater impact . 
" We hear a lot from the general student body on getting involved in preventing sexual violence and how they can help , " she said . 
She said the <ORGANIZATION>Coalition</ORGANIZATION> is working on developing a home-grown education module for all students to complete in <DATE>November</DATE> . 
" Over the <DATE>summer</DATE> it was decided that , with everything going on , we really needed a campaign that would reach a large part of the student body about sexual violence and [ would ] also build a community , " Surface said . 
She said the group is disappointed with the status quo , but encouraged by a new dialogue of students looking out for each other . 
The Coalition gave a ' crash course ' in dealing with situations of sexual assault . 
Will <PERSON>Cadigan</PERSON> , a fourth-year College student in One in Four , explained the importance of the three D 's of bystander intervention : direct , distract and delegate . 
" A lot of what we hear is that people feel awkward about interacting - they feel awkward about going into a situation that they feel is wrong , " he said . 
" Doing nothing is the worst thing you can do . " 
<PERSON>Cadigan</PERSON> emphasized the need for student leaders to " make bystander intervention cool . " 
Surface instructed members on how to provide support to someone who has survived an assault . 
She said the first reaction to a survivor 's story is the most important because it can affect their overall healing process . 
" Say ' I believe you ' and ' its not your fault , ' " she said . 
" The next thing you can do is offer resources . " 
These resources include the Office of the Dean of Students , CAPS , the Women 's Center and the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Resource Agency</ORGANIZATION> . " 
[ It 's ] important not to ask things like ' what were you drinking ' or ' what were you wearing , ' because those things do n't matter and no one deserves to be sexually assaulted , " she said . 
First-year College student <PERSON>Jack Capra</PERSON> pitched his idea for a new CIO , Buddies on Call . 
The service would put safety measures in place for students traveling alone . 
" You call in and people will come and pick you up and walk you to a bus stop or walk you all the way home , " he said . 
<PERSON>Capra</PERSON> said groups of consisting of at least one male and one female student would be on call throughout the <TIME>night</TIME> . 
" I had the idea that me and a couple of my hallmates that do n't go out and party could go and stand on the Corner and walk people home , " <PERSON>Capra</PERSON> said . 
Safe Ride does not operate until <TIME>2:30 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> through <DATE>Saturday</DATE> . 
SafeWalk is available only <DATE>Sunday</DATE> through <DATE>Thursday</DATE> . 
" There 's sort of a gap in services at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Capra</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Capra</PERSON> said planning for issues such as training and identification is still in the beginning stages . 
He suggested members could wear coordinating neon t-shirts to identify themselves . 
He hopes to plan the organization in more detail over the next two to three weeks .
