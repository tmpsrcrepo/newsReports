<PERSON>John Pappas</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily <PERSON>Brady</PERSON> said he Â   hoped the meetings for the other two working groups will see the same success as the <ORGANIZATION>Prevention Working Group</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Prevention Working Group</ORGANIZATION> of the President 's Ad <ORGANIZATION>Hoc Group on University Climate and Culture</ORGANIZATION> held a town hall-style meeting <DATE>Monday</DATE> in which students , faculty and other <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community members discussed ideas about how to prevent sexual violence on Grounds . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University Climate and Culture</ORGANIZATION> group includes three working groups : Prevention , <ORGANIZATION>Response and Culture</ORGANIZATION> . 
While all of the groups work closely together , separate meetings for each group are held to facilitate deeper collaboration on issues . 
" Each of these messages is so important that we wanted to focus the time and effort into the individual work groups , " Prevention Working Group Chair <PERSON>Bill Brady</PERSON> said . 
" There 's some degree of overlap from the mission of one work group to another , so we share and communicate . " 
The purpose of the town hall meeting was to involve the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community in creating solutions to prevent sexual violence on Grounds . 
" We want you to be here and we want you to be able to express yourself , thoughts , opinions , concerns , anything that 's appropriate for the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to use , " <PERSON>Brady</PERSON> said in his address to attendees . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Prevention Working Group</ORGANIZATION> outlined five charges to prevention programs - alcohol and drugs , reporting and student advocacy , admissions and infrastructure . 
The five different charges were represented at different tables around which attendees circulated to discuss solutions . 
Under the alcohol and drug charge , participants discussed safe drinking practices and changing residence hall policies , which may indirectly encourage students to drink off-Grounds . 
In discussing infrastructure , participants mentioned the role of resident advisors and how they could intervene to prevent sexual assault . 
The infrastructure charge also discussed how increased lighting and emergency phones could improve student safety on Grounds . 
Conversations across all charges emphasized the risks first-year students face upon arrival to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and initial exposure to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> life . 
" There are real risks that happen when people show up in those first six weeks , " an attendee said in the group discussion . 
" They do n't know the people they 're with , they do n't know the environment they 're in , they 're encouraged to do new things . " 
Attendees offered different solutions to reduce first years ' vulnerability in their first weeks , such as a mentor program that matches first years with undergraduate upperclassmen , especially women . 
" There is such a wealth of knowledge in the older students , " an attendee said . 
" Older students have so much experience and first-year women are at such a risk when they come here . " 
Other solutions offered by attendees went past the scope of first-year students . 
Many participants emphasized the need for continued education throughout students ' careers at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> in addition to a heavy concentration of sexual assault education for first-year students . 
<PERSON>Brady</PERSON> said sexual assault education needs to start at the basics , including defining " sexual violence . " 
" I think some people have an idea of sexual violence as one specific act when it 's a spectrum of things that can happen , " <PERSON>Brady</PERSON> said . 
Participants also highlighted how <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> men should be involved in sexual assault policy reform based on their willingness to see change on the cultural and administrative levels . 
" Men are standing up and being passionate allies to change this situation , " an attendee said . 
" It 's really a time to step into that . " 
<PERSON>Brady</PERSON> said the meeting provided constructive dialogue and new ideas to consider for two reports due to President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> at the end of <DATE>March</DATE> . 
" I think we heard several new things that we had n't considered , we heard many things we talked about before [ and ] we got new perspectives from things we heard before , " <PERSON>Brady</PERSON> said . 
" We will take all of it to heart and factor it into our consideration . " 
<PERSON>Brady</PERSON> said he hoped the meetings for the other two working groups will see the same success as the <ORGANIZATION>Prevention Working Group</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We met the objectives to broaden this topic and make sure the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community is represented , " <PERSON>Brady</PERSON> said .
