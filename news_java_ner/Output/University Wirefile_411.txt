Student Council hit the ground running <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> evening with its second meeting of the term . 
Council began work on new projects , including obtaining buses to transport students to this year 's Foxfield races . 
Because UTS will not be providing transportation , <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> has reached out to a bus company in <LOCATION>Raleigh</LOCATION> , hoping to implement a similar system to previous years , but run through Council . 
In addition , <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Jalen Ross</PERSON> , a third-year Engineering student , announced a new Council ambassador program that is going to be launched this year . 
" One of the biggest ways I think that we will begin to fix our relationships problem is to be at [ events ] that our constituents hold , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said . 
The new program would advertise large-scale events on a central forum . 
Council representatives would be required to attend a certain number of the events so that there is at least one representative at all of them . 
" I 'm kind of branding us as <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> ambassadors so that people can put a face to <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said . 
" The more <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> members we can get at events , talking to people , the better . 
[ We need to have ] intentional conversations about how the event is going , what the event is for ... so that we know where they 're going and what they need help with as well as asking about problems . " 
First-year College student <PERSON>Abe Axler</PERSON> , chair of the representative body , said the ambassador program is part of <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> 's effort to make students more connected to the organization . 
" We 're showing them what <PERSON>Studco</PERSON> can do and how Studco cares , " <PERSON>Axler</PERSON> said . 
In addition , the <ORGANIZATION>Student Concerns Committee</ORGANIZATION> worked on drafting a resolution for sexual assault policies at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Sexual assault can not be considered an honor offense due to several conflicting federal laws ; however the resolution would provide tangible points of advocacy for change at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The resolution is titled " The Sexual Misconduct Awareness , Recovery , and Tangible Change ( SMART ) Resolution . " 
" I 'm really excited that our <ORGANIZATION>Student Concerns Committee</ORGANIZATION> is going to be taking up the SMART resolution , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said . 
" It 's a list of six or seven things that we think we can advocate for tangible change there . 
There are n't really hurdles to getting these things done . 
It just takes real manpower and initiative , which we have . " 
The committee will include a report clarifying the federal laws which hinder making sexual assault an honor offense along with the resolution at next week 's meeting . 
" Every University in the country is currently grappling with this , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said . 
" The biggest thing for us after passing it is ensuring that they follow through on it . 
It partners us with the administration . " 
The resolution will be brought to a vote before the entire <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> next week .
