The <ORGANIZATION>General Council of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity</ORGANIZATION> suspended the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> chapter 's charter <DATE>May 2</DATE> for violating its risk management policies . 
The <ORGANIZATION>General Council</ORGANIZATION> is a five-member board that governs the national actions of the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta Theta Fraternity</ORGANIZATION> . 
According to <PERSON>Bob Biggs</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta Theta</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president , the action " officially closes " Phi Delta Theta on Grounds . 
The risk management policy is a set of guidelines governing actions and behavior of all chapters . 
The policy addresses abuse and hazing , alcohol , drugs , high risk events that expose members , guests or property to injury or damage , and transportation to and from events not held at the chapter house . 
Neither national or chapter representatives would confirm which section of the policy was violated . 
" We conducted our own investigation and found the chapter had violated many risk management policies , " <PERSON>Biggs</PERSON> said . 
But the chapter has appealed the suspension on grounds that <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta</ORGANIZATION> Theta nationals did not conduct a " proper and thorough " investigation . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>General Council</ORGANIZATION> did not follow the process in their statutes for proper investigation of a chapter , " Chapter President <PERSON>Brendan Dignan</PERSON> said . " 
( They ) used double and triple hearsay and never interviewed any of us or alumni " during their investigation . 
<PERSON>Dignan</PERSON> said the chapter has asked the <ORGANIZATION>General Council</ORGANIZATION> to reverse the suspension of the charter . 
If the <ORGANIZATION>General Council</ORGANIZATION> does not repeal the suspension , the chapter plans to present their appeal at the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta Theta National Convention June 22-25</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> . 
According to <PERSON>Dignan</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta Theta</ORGANIZATION> bylaws stipulate that a vote by all chapters and representatives at the convention can overturn a decision by the <ORGANIZATION>General Council</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> investigated the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's Phi Delt chapter in the fall for hazing allegations . 
In an early <DATE>December</DATE> trial the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> revoked <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta Theta</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Fraternal Organization Agreement</ORGANIZATION> after finding them guilty of violating standards 1 and 9 of the <ORGANIZATION>Standards of Conduct</ORGANIZATION> , but the <ORGANIZATION>Judicial Review Board</ORGANIZATION> ruled the sanction was too harsh and instructed the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> and Phi Delt to mediate a new sanction . 
Standard 1 prohibits physical and sexual assault and standard 9 prohibits violation of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policies or of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> regulations as described in The Record , including regulations concerning the use of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> facilities . 
Phi Delt was convicted by the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> of violating standard 1 by depriving pledges of sleep . 
They were also convicted of violating terms of their FOA , a standard 9 violation . 
The FOA is a document that establishes a fraternity 's relationship with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Harry Marshall</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta Theta Housing Corporation</ORGANIZATION> , said he and other alumni stand fully behind the current brothers and leadership in the house . 
" Myself and the <ORGANIZATION>Housing Corporation</ORGANIZATION> feel very strongly the members of the fraternity are honorable individuals and they should continue as part of the national fraternity , " <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> said . 
National Executive Vice President <PERSON>Biggs</PERSON> said that although he is aware of the request for an appeal , <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta Theta</ORGANIZATION> national hopes to recolonize the chapter at a later date . 
" We hope someday <ORGANIZATION>Phi Delta Theta</ORGANIZATION> will be able to return to establish the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Beta chapter , " <PERSON>Biggs</PERSON> said .
