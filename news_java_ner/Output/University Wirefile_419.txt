Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> is a tradition that started in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> with the goal of eliminating sexual violence . 
One of the first marches was held in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> in <DATE>October 1975</DATE> after <PERSON>Susan Alexander Speeth</PERSON> was stabbed and killed while walking home alone . 
Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> has evolved to incorporate ending sexual assault , intimate partner violence and sexual abuse into its goals . 
Here at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> offers a full week of events geared toward education , community solidarity and survivor support , centered around our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> peers who have experienced sexual assault . 
We have written on several issues surrounding sexual assault particularly on college campuses , including the importance of prevention , and the need for discussion about " ask first " consent and the role of intoxication . 
Now , we address the need for survivor support . 
That does n't just mean support through specific institutions like the Women 's Center or the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Resource Agency</ORGANIZATION> . 
These organizations do admirable work , and we should continue to disseminate information about how they can be of help to survivors . 
But getting to these resources requires someone to step outside her own counsel - to say the words aloud to another person . 
We still live in a world where people are ready and waiting to shame survivors , to blame them , to steal their words from them all over again . 
You do n't have to look very far for evidence that we live in a culture full of victim-blaming . 
You can see it in the discussion on CollegiateABC in which a Vanderbilt student who reported a rape is labeled a " rat . " 
You can see it in the person who approached a member of One Less following Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> 's survival panel <DATE>Monday</DATE> and said anyone who talks openly about sexual assault is " dying for attention . " 
Reactions like these discourage survivors from admitting what happened to them , seeking help and seeking justice . 
During the question and answer panel following the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> mock trial this week , co-President of One Less <PERSON>Staige Davis</PERSON> said the first thing you should always do if a friend tells you she was sexually assaulted is say " I believe you . 
This is not your fault . " 
Whether you come to the entirety of the rally and the vigil tonight , or come for just 15 minutes , you are saying to survivors , " I believe you . 
I support you . 
I will work to build a community that supports you . " 
That solidarity is just as important as the policy issues we have discussed thus far . 
Some say a shortcoming of events like Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> is that they are preaching to the choir ; the people who attend already know how to offer support . 
It may be true that these events may not directly affect people who perpetuate attitudes of shame and criticism , but they will likely affect them indirectly . 
As a supporter , you can speak up and make a correction whenever a rape joke is made in casual conversation . 
You can speak up and say it is not okay to declare someone deserved to be raped . 
Messages of support can spread like shockwaves . 
We can work to change the culture if we pay attention to all of the small details - all the breadcrumbs it leaves in its wake . 
One in four college women has survived a rape or attempted rape . 
Look around you and count the women in your classrooms , at the gym , in the dining hall . 
That 's a large part of our community who at one time in their lives has felt powerless , violated or broken . 
We can stand together to help survivors reclaim that power - to tell them that they deserve a better community , and we will not stop fighting until we make one .
