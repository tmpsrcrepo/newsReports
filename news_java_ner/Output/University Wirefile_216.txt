An informal discussion <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> addressed <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> 's policy on sexual assault in the wake of public criticism from a parent who alleged that her daughter , a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student , was raped . 
Student Council President <PERSON>Daisy Lundy</PERSON> said the idea for the meeting was first addressed several weeks ago . 
As a member of <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Facts and Education</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> said she thinks the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> needs to increase its sexual assault education , awareness and resources . 
" I was surprised to learn how many people did not realize sexual assault was a problem at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> said at the beginning of the meeting . 
The discussion focused mainly on <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> outreach and education . 
Participants said they were concerned with student ignorance about what constitutes sexual assault , a term encompassing everything from rape to unwanted sexual advances . 
" We need to hold our students to higher standards , " <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> said . 
The forum also addressed the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's punishment of convicted sexual offenders . 
On a Web site she created <DATE>Sunday</DATE> , the mother of a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student who reported her daughter had been raped by another student said the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> did not adequately respond to her daughter 's accusations . 
In a letter she wrote to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , the mother said she received dozens of e-mails from other students disappointed in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's treatment of sexual offenders . 
She posted 12 students ' stories on the site . 
<PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , the coordinator of sexual assault education at the Women 's Center , works directly with sexual assault victims and spoke at the meeting . 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said she meets with students who say they have been sexually assaulted and informs them of their rights and the options available to them . 
If students do not wish to press charges outside the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , they can pursue both formal and informal resolutions within the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> added . 
" We try to find the right help for them , " she said . 
Dean of <ORGANIZATION>Students Penny Rue</ORGANIZATION> discussed how various options work . 
One possibility is informal mediation . 
Rue stressed that successful mediations are extremely important for rehabilitating the survivor . 
One mediation resulted in the perpetrator taking time away from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> until the victim graduated , <ORGANIZATION>Rue</ORGANIZATION> said . 
A few others also had positive outcomes . 
" We have had about three or four successful mediations , " Rue said . 
Sexual assault victims also can request a hearing by the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> , which can result in a number of disciplinary actions , including suspension and expulsion . 
However , no one found guilty of sexual assault in the past five years was suspended or expelled . 
Many people present at the meeting said the current system is not harsh enough . 
Sexual assault cases involving acquaintance rape , which comprise most of the cases at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , are particularly difficult to adjudicate due to a lack of evidence , <ORGANIZATION>Rue</ORGANIZATION> said . 
Rue said the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> is always an option for victims of acquaintance rape to pursue . 
" It is always the choice of the complainant , " she said .
