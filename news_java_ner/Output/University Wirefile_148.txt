In light of <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> 's recent divestment from <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> , a controversial company involved in energy speculation in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> , the Student Affairs and <ORGANIZATION>Athletics Committee of the Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> heard <DATE>Friday</DATE> a student presentation regarding ethics in <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> investment . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> needs a " plan for institutionalized ethics in investment , " Student Council President <PERSON>Abby Fifer</PERSON> said . 
" We are delighted that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> divested from <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> ; we look at it as a case study . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's divestment sets an example and is a " small step to provide inspiration to take a leap " toward an international code of ethics in investing , she said . 
<ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> is an oil company that has been accused of hiring corrupt Burmese soldiers to protect a natural gas pipeline in <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> . 
A <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> federal judge has ruled evidence suggests soldiers have raped , murdered and enslaved local villagers . 
The judge declined to rule Unocol intentionally encouraged these practices . 
Although <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> owned only <PERCENT>0.02 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> 's publicly traded stock , the divestment had tremendous symbolic impact , said <PERSON>Andrew Price</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>Free Burma Coalition</ORGANIZATION> . 
News of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> 's divestment has been broadcast on <ORGANIZATION>Radio Free Asia</ORGANIZATION> and has inspired real hope in Burmese people , he said . 
He added divestment helped put the reputation of ethically questionable companies on the line , he said . 
" This is a great step toward promoting ethics , not just on Grounds but throughout the world , " he said . 
Price outlined several suggestions for the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> on how to improve investment ethics , including establishment of a student and faculty investment ethics advisory board , a policy requiring University to vote in shareholder resolutions and specific divestments from other ethically questionable companies . 
Requiring the external money managers who handle the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's endowment fund to abide by a code of conduct in all <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> investments also would promote ethical investments , Price said . 
Although many members of the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> praised <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> for its role in the <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> issue , <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Benjamin Warthen</PERSON> expressed concern that so few members of the student body openly expressed support for the <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> 's position and recent actions . 
" <PERCENT>99.9 percent</PERCENT> of students are unconcerned about the issue , " he said . 
" Is Student Council truly reflective of the student body ? 
Somehow I want to see more support . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> divested from <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> last week when <PERSON>Richard Mayo</PERSON> , an independent <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> investment manager , sold the stock in response to a severe drop in the stock 's value after the <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> terorist attacks in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , D.C , and in response to student ethical concerns on Grounds . 
The investment manager made the decision to sell completely independent of the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> does not deal with the everyday trading of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> stocks , <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> " Sandy " <PERSON>Gilliam Jr.</PERSON> said . 
" Mr. <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> would be very proud " of the concerned student groups , <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Terence P. Ross</PERSON> said . 
" With reasonable civil discourse you persuaded people , " he said , praising <PERSON>Fifer</PERSON> and Price for their work . 
During Student Council 's presentation to the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> , about two dozen protestors gathered on the steps of the <LOCATION>Rotunda</LOCATION> to voice their support . 
" We 're here to voice our support for investment ethics , " fourth-year College student <PERSON>Ross Kane</PERSON> said . 
" It 's a matter of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> using the leverage it has as an investor to support ethics in the international community . "
