While it may seem like a resumption of normalcy after last semester 's uproar over the Rolling Stone report on sexual assault and the " Black Lives Matter " protests , the Living Wage Campaign ignited our eerily silent , snowy and slippery grounds with shouts of dissent last week . 
If you think the cold is bad , three years ago students in the Living Wage Campaign organized a 13-day hunger strike through the snow , rain and , of course , hunger . 
But the <ORGANIZATION>Living Wage Campaign</ORGANIZATION> is nothing new ; it is not about trendy activism or in response to any single event . 
It comes out of a legacy of students putting their bodies on the line for workers ' rights , a tradition , which , if you will , is one of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's least publicized . 
In the <DATE>1960s</DATE> students went as far as <LOCATION>Waynesboro</LOCATION> to protest a <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Factory</ORGANIZATION> over wages and employee benefits . 
During <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War protests in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students stormed the Lawn , occupied buildings and made demands from the administration , among them the right for <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employees to strike and bargain collectively . 
And now in the context of such incendiary events last semester over hate crimes and rape , the Living Wage Campaign is not simply making noise to shout . 
Rather , the Living Wage Campaign 's goal to address the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's stark division across racial and socioeconomic lines is not unrelated to the fall-out of the Rolling Stone incident . 
Take , for example , the new policies . 
Among the sober brother rules and bystander intervention programs , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> will now increase security presence as an added safety measure . 
More safety means more business for private security firms . 
But whose work is valued more ? 
A private security firm in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>H&H Security Services</ORGANIZATION> , said that more than <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of its private event jobs are for fraternities and sororities across central <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . 
The set up : one armed guard , one unarmed ; the average hourly wage to monitor closed doors and drunken crowds : <MONEY>$ 25</MONEY> to <MONEY>$ 35</MONEY> an hour . 
It is anyone 's guess as to if the <MONEY>$ 35</MONEY> an hour goes to the guy with the gun . 
Compare this to the majority of dining hall staff on contract labor through <ORGANIZATION>Aramark</ORGANIZATION> . 
Not only do they fail to receive close to this figure , but many of the lowest paid workers also fail to qualify for health and education benefits because they are part-time or contract labor . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> touts itself for being " the employer of choice " in the central <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> region , and while it may be employing more and more security guards these days , it consistently underpays its workers while the rest of the country moves on . 
A bill backed by President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> and currently stalled in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> would raise the minimum wage from <MONEY>$ 7.25</MONEY> to <MONEY>$ 10.10</MONEY> . 
Outside federal legislation , many states are stepping up . 
Over half of the 50 states and <ORGANIZATION>the District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> now have minimum wages above the federal minimum wage , yet <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> remains steadfastly at <MONEY>$ 7.25</MONEY> an hour . 
Recently cities such as <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Santa Fe</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Washington D.C.</LOCATION> have raised the minimum wage well over the <MONEY>$ 10.10</MONEY> recommendation . 
<LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> has even approved a measure to raise its city 's minimum wage to <MONEY>$ 15</MONEY> . 
However , in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , cities must cede to the state 's prerogative and can not pass minimum wages citywide . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> does have the power to increase the wages of contract laborers , like the numerous employed by <ORGANIZATION>Aramark</ORGANIZATION> . 
They have taken no action as of yet , but have no problem paying top dollar for security firms to continue to protect an already closed culture . 
The recent climate at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has led to strong statements , initiatives and soul-searching about the culture of U.Va in its perpetuation of sexual assault , exclusion and violence . 
These actions , initiatives and the funds to make them possible came swiftly and without question to address a problem that blemished the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Yet , the economic injustices that occur every day continue to tarnish the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's reputation . 
The Living Wage Campaign seeks to influence the administration to implement realistic measures to curb injustices that we continue to view as separate problems .
