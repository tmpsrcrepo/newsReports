College students and citizens all across <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> remember the pain and raw emotions they felt on <DATE>April 16 , 2007</DATE> as the tragedy at <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> unfolded . 
In the weeks and months following the terrors at <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> , many elected officials , school administrators , students , parents , and individuals pointed fingers at failures in campus safety on our college campuses . 
<PERSON>Mark Obenshain</PERSON> , a concerned parent and state senator from <LOCATION>Harrisonburg</LOCATION> , was intent on seeking a meaningful response to ensure that the commonwealth of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> was doing everything in its power to prevent similar situations from happening in the future . 
In <DATE>2008</DATE> , Obenshain sponsored <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Bills 538 and 539 . 
The first ( SB 538 ) mandated that college campuses " establish a comprehensive , prompt , and reliable first warning and emergency notification system for students , staff , and faculty . " 
This bill has had a huge impact in ensuring the safety of college students throughout the commonwealth . 
As a student at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , I witnessed these notification systems firsthand in the <DATE>fall of 2011</DATE> when an earthquake struck central <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , a bizarre event that caused confusion and panic . 
The emergency notification system that had been installed because of <LOCATION>Obenshain</LOCATION> 's bill efficiently communicated all pertinent information to students , faculty and staff . 
The second bill ( SB 539 ) required the governing boards of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> public schools to establish both threat assessment teams and committees that seek to provide education and violence prevention . 
These two institutional improvements ensure that our college campuses are constantly adapting to the new technologies and methods , so that they can be implemented in safety protocols . 
These two bills , both of which were passed with bipartisan support , have no doubt improved the safety of all students on <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's colleges . 
However , <ORGANIZATION>Obenshain</ORGANIZATION> 's work does n't just extend to college campuses . 
Obenshain is a man that is driven not on personal ambition , but rather the desire to make a better <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> for all people - whether Republican or Democrat ; conservative or liberal ; young or old ; gay , straight or bisexual ; black , white or Hispanic ; Christian , Jewish or Muslim . 
Few elected officials in today 's society hold this trait , and <PERSON>Obenshain</PERSON> has devoted his entire adult life to public service . 
His work in combating online sexual predators , sex trafficking and elder abuse has helped make <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> a safer place . 
Finally , <PERSON>Obenshain</PERSON> has always supported legislation that aims to get Virginians back to work by providing Virginians with equal opportunity to find good-paying jobs . 
Obenshain understands that in order for college students to be successful , they need jobs upon graduation . 
He has consistently supported legislation that ensures the government is able to create an environment that is conducive to job growth and expansion . 
A recent study by <ORGANIZATION>The Opportunity Nation</ORGANIZATION> coalition discovered that almost 6 million young people aged 16 to 25 were either out of a job or not attending school . 
That number represents <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of the youth population in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
Obenshain understands that for young Virginians to be successful , they need a good education and solid jobs waiting for them upon graduation . 
With two college-aged kids , <PERSON>Obenshain</PERSON> understands the needs of college students in today 's ever-changing society . 
He 's worked hard to make their lives safer and will continue to do so once elected <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's next attorney general . 
As college students , we need an attorney general who comprehends the needs of our generation . 
Vote for Obenshain for attorney general on <DATE>Nov. 5</DATE> . 
He 'll be an attorney general for all Virginians . 
<PERSON>Matt Wertman</PERSON> is a fourth-year Architecture student and the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>College Republican Federation of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> , which includes chapters at thirty of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's college campuses .
