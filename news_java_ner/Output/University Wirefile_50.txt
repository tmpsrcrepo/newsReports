Continuing the investigation into the recent attacks of two <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students , <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> have teamed up to investigate the incidents and address community concerns , but still are withholding details about any possible leads . 
Police declined to comment on the specifics of new leads , but did announce an increase in possible leads following <ORGANIZATION>University Police Chief Michael Sheffield</ORGANIZATION> 's <DATE>Nov. 20</DATE> open e-mail to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community concerning the crimes . 
Anonymous tips have come in from as far as <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Sheffield</PERSON> said . 
Police mobilization came in response to the <DATE>Oct. 15</DATE> rape of a student under <ORGANIZATION>Beta Bridge</ORGANIZATION> and a <DATE>Nov. 14</DATE> assault of another <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> female student on <ORGANIZATION>17th St. Police</ORGANIZATION> also have been investigating possible connections of the two assaults to the recent break-ins of Chancellor St. sorority houses . 
The perpetrator stole photos of sorority sisters and made several 1-900 telephone calls . 
While the crimes may be connected , <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Police remain doubtful the same person committed both the robberies and the assaults . 
" We can not exclude the fact that they may be connected , " <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Lt. Chip Harding</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" But , three of the composites are very similar and the one from the sorority appears clearly different . " 
Following the second attack , <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> announced the formation of a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police</ORGANIZATION> task force concerning the assaults . 
" In general [ the <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Department</ORGANIZATION> ] has their own manpower , " <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Kirsten Curtis</PERSON> said . 
" However , we have officers working closely with the <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police</ORGANIZATION> on the rape and sexual assault cases . " 
Both police units have worked to increase public safety awareness while easing some of the community 's anxiety . 
However , many students have disregarded recent safety warnings . 
Police frequently have found students walking alone and leaving their doors unlocked . 
" The only thing I 'm certain of is that we have tons of female students walking alone along dark pathways and shortcuts , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
Concern in the community and among parents still remains high , largely because of speculation and rumors in the community , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and police officials said . 
" I think there 's a lot of rumors going around , " <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON> said . 
" People are concerned , and they should be , but panic 's not going to help anybody . " 
Dean of Students <PERSON>Robert T. Canevari</PERSON> emphasized the importance of accurate information and commonsense decision making . 
" It 's important to separate fact from fiction , " <PERSON>Canevari</PERSON> said . 
" Safety is an issue that always needs to be at the forefront of one 's mind . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has appropriated <MONEY>$ 80,000</MONEY> for the <ORGANIZATION>General Safety and Security Committee</ORGANIZATION> in order to improve safety in the Rugby Road Area and support a Student Watch program to involve community members . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> said they are trying to establish a third van for the <ORGANIZATION>Escort Service</ORGANIZATION> and now are seeking volunteers .
