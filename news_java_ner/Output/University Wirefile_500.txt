Rolling Stone 's recent article about sexual assault at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has already invoked a wide range of emotions from the student body . 
For some , the piece is an unfounded attack on our school ; for others , it is a recognition of a harsh reality ; and for what I suspect is a large majority of us , it falls somewhere in between . 
It is now our task as students to determine how to respond to that article - not to the magazine , but within our own community . 
There are several important takeaways from this piece , the most important being that , regardless of what elements of the piece are debatable , there is a problem with how this school handles sexual assault . 
Yes , this article could have been written about virtually any university . 
Replace " UVA " with any of the schools on the <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> administration 's list for Title IX violations - and even schools not on that list - and the article probably would not change significantly . 
For that reason , it feels immensely frustrating to be singled out , when inaction on rape and sexual assault cases persists across the country . 
But singled out or not , we should not evaluate our adjudicative processes comparatively ; we should evaluate them using standards that are independent of the processes of other schools . 
With this in mind , it becomes increasingly difficult to know where to start our analysis . 
The Rolling Stone article pinpoints several roots of our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's problem , the first being the school 's deference to Greek life . 
On this count , it is hard to argue with <PERSON>Sabrina Rubin Erdely</PERSON> , the author of the piece . 
After terminating its <ORGANIZATION>Fraternal Organization Agreement</ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION>Pi Kappa Alpha</ORGANIZATION> ( PiKA ) last year for incidents of hazing , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> allowed the fraternity - which , notably , was Dean Groves ' fraternity when he was a student - to return to Grounds . 
As Erdely rightly points out , the school has been unbelievably slow to investigate <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> despite many allegations of sexual assault . 
This argument , and others , are persuasive . 
But where Erdely falters is in her effort to condemn the student body alongside the administration , as though they are equally at fault - when in reality , students have been the source of most if not all of the discussion of sexual assault on our campus . 
Pointing to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's Honor code , Erdely makes the point University students have heard so often : there is something inherently shameful about students being expelled for cheating or plagiarism and not for sexual assault . 
This is undeniable , but her mention of this ignores the differences between Honor offenses and sexual assault cases - namely , that students handle one , and the administration handles the other . 
This is not to suggest that students should handle sexual assault cases ( in fact , I have argued the opposite ) ; rather , there is a difference in the standards students hold their peers to , compared with the standards the administration appears to hold . 
In particular , I take issue with <ORGANIZATION>Erdely</ORGANIZATION> 's statement that the " genteel University of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> has no radical feminist culture seeking to upend the patriarchy . " 
We can not deny there is some pervasive culture here that allows abuses to occur . 
But we have undeniably excellent student groups aimed at addressing this very issue . 
Groups like One Less - which is far from a " secret society , " as Erdely writes - and One in Four create a network of support that is clearly unparalleled by the administration . 
The Handprint Project , started by <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students , encourages students to be active bystanders especially on Boys ' Bid Night , a night that typically sees spikes in reports of sexual assault . 
Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night Week</ORGANIZATION> , which <ORGANIZATION>Erdely</ORGANIZATION> describes as " the pinnacle of [ University students ' ] polite activism , " is no small undertaking and even includes a <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> mock trial . 
Recently , <ORGANIZATION>the University Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> has moved to revamp its sexual misconduct subcommittee . 
So we see the problem is not a lack of effort from the student body , but rather a lack of response from the administration , an area where Erdely and I agree . 
Our school has notoriously mishandled sexual assault cases . 
Of course , the administration is not to blame for the fact that sexual assaults occur - that blame lies squarely with the perpetrators . 
But the administration is to blame for allowing a culture to persist in which perpetrators continue to offend without fear of punishment . 
The burden to fix this does not lie with students , though many students , impressively , have chosen to take that burden on . 
Moving forward , the administration is left with no choice but to reform how it handles sexual misconduct cases . 
A recent theme at our school has been finding the good in the bad - especially with the devastating , recent loss of two peers ( one of which , frankly , should not have been mentioned in the Rolling Stone article for lack of relevance ) . 
This is never an easy task , yet here again , we have been afforded an opportunity to find the good . 
Environments like <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> may foster some of the most egregious actions imaginable , and students who engage in such behavior are far too prevalent at our school . 
But that does not mean there is no community at this school for survivors . 
The issue at hand is that this supportive community does not seem to extend to the administration ; this is where we should focus our efforts , and this is where we should seek improvement .
