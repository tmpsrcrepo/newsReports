<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily The University</ORGANIZATION> chapter of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> released a statement <DATE>Friday</DATE> saying an internal investigation has found several inconsistencies in the report of an alleged gang rape at the fraternity house in <DATE>Sept. 2012</DATE> detailed in a Rolling Stone article published <DATE>two weeks ago</DATE> . 
The initial article details the story of a first-year student , identified as <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> , who attended a date function with a fellow lifeguard at a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> pool who was a member of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity . 
He is identified in the article only as " Drew . " 
The article says he brought her to a party at the fraternity house and then took her upstairs where she found herself in a room with several men who brutally gang raped her over the course of several hours . 
Rolling Stone released a letter <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> saying new discrepancies have come to light regarding <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's report , though it did not specify what those discrepancies are . 
The statement from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter says a roster of employees at the Aquatic and <ORGANIZATION>Fitness Center</ORGANIZATION> for the <DATE>fall 2012</DATE> semester does not list any men belonging to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity . 
It also says the internal investigation found there was no date function or other social activity on the <TIME>night</TIME> of <DATE>Sept. 28 , 2012</DATE> - the date <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> identified in the Rolling Stone article as the night of her rape . 
Jackie is also reported as saying an individual in the room on the night of her attack encouraged one man to participate in the assault by saying , " Do n't you want to be a brother ? 
... We all had to do it , so you do , too . " 
The fraternity says no pledging activities take place during the fall semester . 
" Our Chapter 's pledging and initiation periods , as required by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> , take place solely in the <DATE>spring</DATE> semester and not in the fall semester , " the statement reads . 
" We document the initiation of new members at the end of each <DATE>spring</DATE> . 
Moreover , no ritualized sexual assault is part of our pledging or initiation process . 
This notion is vile , and we vehemently refute this claim . " 
The investigation was conducted by the chapter 's undergraduate members , according to the statement , and done as part of an effort to contribute to the ongoing <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police</ORGANIZATION> investigation into the incident . 
" It is our hope that this information will encourage people who may know anything relevant to this case to contact the <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Department</ORGANIZATION> as soon as possible , " the statement reads . 
" In the meantime , we will continue to assist investigators in whatever way we can . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police</ORGANIZATION> said they are continuing with the investigation . 
" Our purpose is to find the truth in any matter and that 's what we are looking for here , " according to a statement sent by police spokesperson <PERSON>Miriam Dickler</PERSON> . 
" These articles do not change our focus moving forward . " 
<PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> , a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> graduated quoted in the Rolling Stone article who also serves as project coordinator for <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Response and Prevention</ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Students Office</ORGANIZATION> , said any factual inaccuracies in the Rolling Stone article do not alter her commitment to building a culture of survivor support . 
" It 's an advocate 's job to believe and support , never to play investigator or adjudicator , " she said in an email . 
" I did n't and do n't question <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's credibility because that is not my role . 
Rolling Stone played adjudicator , investigator and advocate - and did a slipshod job at that . 
As a result <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> suffers , the young men in <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> suffered , and survivors everywhere can unfairly be called into question . 
We still have to build a culture of support and reporting so that justice can be done right and survivors can find healing . 
Rolling Stone has run roughshod over years of advocacy , over fairness and justice , and ultimately , over <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> . "
