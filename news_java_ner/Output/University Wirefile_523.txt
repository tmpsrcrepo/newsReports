I imagine that the staff of The Cavalier Daily had other stories planned for the end of last week . 
I certainly had a different column in process before an article in Rolling Stone was published <DATE>last Wednesday</DATE> detailing heinous allegations of rape and what is described as a response from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administration that is woefully insufficient . 
The foci of virtually everyone on and around Grounds shifted immediately to the story and the response to it . 
I watched , in part , as those seeking information and those who had something to say turned increasingly to The Cavalier Daily . 
I have written in this space previously wondering what the purpose of a college newspaper is and musing on various possibilities . 
What The Cavalier Daily has been for the <DATE>last week</DATE> is a lot of how I 'd like to define any good newspaper . 
Unlike the <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> story for which The Cavalier Daily leveraged a small group spearheaded by <PERSON>Kelly Kaler</PERSON> to effectively report a story that unfolded over weeks ( and continued , in fact , this past <DATE>Thursday</DATE> ) , the breadth of what the CD can do was shown this week . 
I stopped counting at a dozen different bylines on articles related to the Rolling Stone piece and reactions to it . 
There were reports from many corners of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and from virtually all groups of stakeholders including faculty , alumni , undergraduate and graduate students , the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> , state-level politicians and so on . 
On Twitter there were photos in real time of protests that sprung up including the few arrests outside of the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> house . 
I watched as my personal twitter feed ( one separate from my @cdpubliceditor handle ) shifted from links to national news sources to sharing Cavalier Daily articles . 
That was notable for me because in the past , even with University-related news , people I follow tend to stick with national publications . 
The Cavalier Daily was simply doing a better job of working the story than anyone else . 
The articles they ran were informative , concisely written and above all , timely . 
The reaction roundup article published <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> by <PERSON>Peter Simonsen</PERSON> was a particularly good idea , I 'd very much like to see it updated as warranted . 
Any time I learned of a reaction from anywhere else , The Cavalier Daily already had it . 
It really felt like the CD was just everywhere on this , which is about as high praise as I can think to give a newsroom working a story . 
The one story that really fell flat for me was the article on the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administration 's proposed changes to its sexual misconduct policy . 
It was published early <DATE>Thursday</DATE> morning online and in the <DATE>Thursday</DATE> print edition and had nothing referencing the Rolling Stone article or reaction to that article and felt like it was lacking as a result . 
Making another phone call to ask whether or how the policy would be moved forward in response ( even if met with no comment or demurral ) would have helped readers locate the information in the article in the changing landscape . 
As is , it read like it was already old news and the quotations in the article were already out of date . 
But that is really a nitpick in what was a fantastic job of reporting overall . 
Beyond giving us the news , the <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily</ORGANIZATION> website was important as a digital gathering place . 
The comment sections on several articles blossomed quickly with hundreds of comments across several pieces . 
Of course not all of the comments are helpful , reasonable or even accurate , but a place to feel that one 's voice can be heard is important - a tremendous service to the community . 
The " Letters from the Community " feature on the website is invaluable . 
The one thing that felt disconnected for me was the mobile app . 
With no comments available on the articles and without updates as frequent as the website it just was n't as useful as other ways of accessing The Cavalier Daily . 
Beyond everything I 've just written and as good a job as I think the <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily</ORGANIZATION> staff has done covering the Rolling Stone article reaction , I think the most important thing the staff did from the perspective of publishing a good newspaper was not lose the handle on the other important things going on at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Second year student <PERSON>Peter D'Agostino</PERSON> died suddenly on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and The Cavalier Daily had a news article up immediately and followed with updates , a letter from <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> 's friends and , eventually , his obituary as provided by his family . 
All of these were top news items on the website , which I think was the right place for them .
