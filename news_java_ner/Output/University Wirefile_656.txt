The <ORGANIZATION>Albemarle County Circuit</ORGANIZATION> court granted two motions filed by the defense in the case of the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth v. Jesse Matthew</ORGANIZATION> . 
In Albemarle county <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> is charged with abduction with intent to defile , the murder of <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> , a second year in the <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> , and reckless driving . 
He is also on trial in <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> county for attempted murder , abduction and sexual assault . 
Defense attorney <PERSON>Jim Hingeley</PERSON> addressed the court regarding both motions . 
The first motion filed was to appoint a DNA expert to examine evidence , and the second was for a continuance of trial . 
Hingeley said the requests were based on the need for funding to be authorized by the court as well as additional time needed to find and appoint an expert . 
The defense does " not have someone in mind , ' <PERSON>Hingeley</PERSON> said . 
Hingeley said the expert to be appointed would be qualified to do an independent review of the evidence , including some items which have not yet been analyzed . 
" It 's not just a matter of getting an expert , " <PERSON>Hingeley</PERSON> said . 
" There are some items that have DNA evidence in them that have not yet been analyzed by the Commonwealth . " 
Hingeley said the time-table for identifying a DNA expert and analyzing the evidence is uncertain , and the current trial date set for <DATE>June</DATE> is too early . 
Hingeley suggested that the court set a status review in the case for the first two weeks of <DATE>May</DATE> , pending the court 's schedule . 
<ORGANIZATION>Albemarle County Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> 's Attorney <PERSON>Denise Lunsford</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> has no objection to the motions , and a DNA expert would be beneficial to both parties . 
" The Commonwealth does intend to rely in some way on DNA evidence , " <PERSON>Lunsford</PERSON> said . 
" Having an expert review the material is alway helpful . " 
Lunsford also said that she felt the <DATE>June</DATE> trial date was optimistic . " 
[ In <DATE>May</DATE> we ] should have an idea of when the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> will be done with its analysis , " <PERSON>Lunsford</PERSON> said . 
The Court granted both motions , and set a status review in the case for <DATE>May 5th</DATE> at 4p . 
m. , at which time the Court will address any additional motions and set a date for the trial . 
The defense suggested that any future motions be discussed between the defense and <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> 's Attorney , in order to avoid the need to hold future hearings . 
A court order will be used to appoint the DNA expert , once identified . 
After the hearing <PERSON>Lunsford</PERSON> said that the prosecution " tends to get along fairly well " with the defense . 
Matthew has also been linked by DNA to the disappearance and death of <PERSON>Morgan Harrington</PERSON> , a <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Tech student who disappeared on <DATE>Oct. 17 , 2009</DATE> after leaving a concert at <ORGANIZATION>John Paul Jones Arena</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> . 
Her body was found on an <LOCATION>Albemarle County</LOCATION> farm on <DATE>January 26 , 2010</DATE> . 
Harrington 's mother , <PERSON>Gil Harrington</PERSON> , was present at the hearing , and said it was strange to see <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> in person , and that she was grateful for the opportunity for justice . 
Harrington also said they had not received any contact from the <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> family . 
" Being here for these proceedings is one of the last things I can do for [ Morgan ] , " <PERSON>Harrington</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> 's parents were also present at the hearing . 
" All we can do is try and carry this burden together , " <PERSON>Harrington</PERSON> said .
