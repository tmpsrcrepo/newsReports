<PERSON>Sarah MacAdam</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily Students gathered outside of the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> house to protest the fraternity following the release of the Rolling Stone article in <DATE>November</DATE> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's chapter of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity announced plans to take legal action against Rolling Stone magazine in a statement released <DATE>Monday</DATE> . 
The lawsuit comes shortly after the <DATE>Sunday</DATE> release of the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Journalism School</ORGANIZATION> 's review of the article , which described an alleged gang rape said to have taken place in the fraternity house . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Journalism School</ORGANIZATION> 's report found failures at all levels of the editorial process , and Rolling Stone has since fully retracted the article . 
" After 130 days of living under a cloud of suspicion as a result of reckless reporting by Rolling Stone magazine , today the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Alpha Chapter of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> announced plans to pursue all available legal action against the magazine , " the statement read . 
Third-year College student <PERSON>Stephen Scipione</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> Virginia Alpha Chapter at the time the article was released , said the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Journalism School</ORGANIZATION> 's review affirmed what he saw as Rolling Stone 's reckless behavior and <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> 's lack of involvement with the events depicted . 
" The report by <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University 's School of Journalism</ORGANIZATION> demonstrates the reckless nature in which Rolling Stone researched and failed to verify facts in its article that erroneously accused <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> of crimes its members did not commit , " <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said . 
" This type of reporting serves as a sad example of a serious decline of journalistic standards . " 
Following the publication of the article - entitled " A Rape on Campus " and written by <PERSON>Sabrina Erdely</PERSON> - <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> requested a criminal investigation into the events described by <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> , the victim of the alleged attack and <ORGANIZATION>Erdely</ORGANIZATION> 's primary source for the article . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Department</ORGANIZATION> held a press conference on <DATE>Mar. 23</DATE> in which <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Timothy Longo</PERSON> declared there was no substantive evidence that the events occurred as described in the article . 
The investigation was suspended indefinitely . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Journalism School</ORGANIZATION> 's review stated the backlash - the criminal investigation along with student uproar - following the Rolling Stone article 's publication was " avoidable , " and was the result of a failure to follow proper journalistic technique . 
" Rolling Stone 's repudiation of the main narrative in " A Rape on Campus " is a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable . 
The failure encompassed reporting , editing , editorial supervision and fact-checking , " the report reads . 
" The magazine set aside or rationalized as unnecessary essential practices of reporting that , if pursued , would likely have led the magazine 's editors to reconsider publishing <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's narrative so prominently , if at all . " 
The fraternity 's statement also describes the acts of vandalism and public protests at the fraternity house in the weeks following the original publication of the Rolling Stone article , including broken windows and spray-painted remarks outside the house . 
<PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said the Rolling Stone article both negatively affected the fraternity 's reputation and decreased the likelihood of future sexual assault victims coming forward . 
" Clearly our fraternity and its members have been defamed , but more importantly we fear this entire episode may prompt some victims to remain in the shadows , fearful to confront their attackers , " <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said . 
" If Rolling Stone wants to play a real role in addressing this problem , it 's time to get serious . "
