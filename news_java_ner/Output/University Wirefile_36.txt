The cool air settled down on a handful of students gathered at the steps of the <LOCATION>Rotunda</LOCATION> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> . 
Earlier that night , at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> , more than 100 students gathered to remember <ORGANIZATION>Wyoming University</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Matthew Shepard</PERSON> , who died earlier this week after two men lured him from a bar , beat him and left him for dead . 
The six students , however , gathered to remember <PERSON>Dwayne Allen Wright</PERSON> , 26 , sentenced to die that night by lethal injection . 
Although <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> died that night , students still gathered to contemplate the situation . 
<PERSON>Wright</PERSON> was 17 when he killed a woman in <DATE>1989</DATE> . 
He is the first <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> resident since <DATE>1924</DATE> to be executed for a crime committed as a minor . 
Some people would think it would be ironic that two candlelight vigils would take place on the Lawn in one night -- one in memorial for the death of a victim of a senseless crime and the other over the impending death of a murderer . 
To some , both were victims . 
" I first heard about [ <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> ] <DATE>Monday</DATE> on ... <ORGANIZATION>National Public Radio</ORGANIZATION> , " said third-year College student <PERSON>Margot Tracy</PERSON> , a co-chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter of <ORGANIZATION>Amnesty International</ORGANIZATION> co-chairwoman and the vigil 's organizer . 
Tracy helped the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter of <ORGANIZATION>Amnesty International</ORGANIZATION> rally around <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> 's cause during the week . 
In efforts to sway <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>James S. Gilmore III</PERSON> -- who could grant <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> a stay of execution -- Tracy sent a letter to the governor via e-mail <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> , decrying the execution and explaining <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> 's situation . 
Using candlelight , <PERSON>Tracy</PERSON> read her e-mail to the group standing in a circle facing each other . 
" <PERSON>Dwayne Allen Wright</PERSON> , like many of the seven juvenile offenders currently on death row , is African-American , grew up in poverty , was exposed to violence at an early age and has suffered serious mental problems , " <PERSON>Tracy</PERSON> said . 
In <DATE>Oct. 1989</DATE> , <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> shot and killed <PERSON>Saba Tekle</PERSON> , an <LOCATION>Annandale</LOCATION> resident and mother of three , after an attempted rape . 
Doctors said <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> 's mental problems are associated with his being partially strangulated by his umbilical cord at birth . 
The criminal trial did not go well for <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> , with defending lawyers downplaying their client 's mental problems . 
Since his conviction , the combination of <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> 's young age and his mental problems has drawn national attention . 
Thanks to the publicity , <PERSON>Tracy</PERSON> and her group learned about the execution , which took place in <LOCATION>Jarratta</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> , <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> . 
" It was very last-minute , all thrown together , " <PERSON>Tracy</PERSON> said of the vigil . 
" I did n't expect more than 10 people to show up . " 
Even with such a low turnout , Tracy hoped that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community would become more aware of the issues . 
" I mean , I did n't really know that much about this until I did some reading on it just <DATE>today</DATE> , " she said . 
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is one of six countries in the world that allows for juvenile perpetrators of crimes to be executed , she added . 
" Most states would n't consider a 16 or 17 old enough to vote , buy alcohol or cigarettes , " <PERSON>Tracy</PERSON> read from her letter . 
" Our state considers him old enough to try as an adult and execute . 
" Mr. governor , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> is one of 24 states that allows for the execution of juvenile offenders . 
Please take us off that list , " the e-mail stated . 
The death penalty is one of the major issues concerning <ORGANIZATION>Amnesty International</ORGANIZATION> . 
Members hope to end the penalty through increased public awareness . 
" When <PERSON>Dwayne Wright</PERSON> committed murder he necessarily forfeited some rights , but not the right to be treated as a human being , " Tracy read . 
" That [ the United States ] signed the international covenant on civil and political rights but reserved the right to execute juvenile offenders does not exempt us from upholding international standards of human rights , " she said . 
" In fact , we are breaking international law through human rights abuses committed on our own soil . 
How ironic for a country that claims to be a vanguard of human rights . " 
Not all attendees at <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> 's vigil felt as strongly about the issue as Tracy . 
" I believe that in some cases , the death penalty is necessary , " first-year College student <PERSON>Liz Woodard</PERSON> said . 
Woodard attended the vigil partially because she was curious about what the vigil would be like . 
For <PERSON>Woodard</PERSON> , the death penalty evokes such ambivalent emotions . 
" It 's a confusing issue , " <PERSON>Woodard</PERSON> said . 
Others that attended the vigil , however , had set opinions about the issue . 
" The fact that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> is one of the only countries in the world " that continues with the death penalty for juveniles is surprising , first-year College student <PERSON>Ginny Weckstein</PERSON> said . 
After the moment of silence , everybody extinguished the small candles . 
" I was running around a lot all day getting this thing together , but during that moment of silence , it was a chance to remember that this was for a person , a human person , " <PERSON>Tracy</PERSON> said . 
" We did n't expect to get a stay of execution , " she said . 
" But the least we can do is to show our support and make a stand . "
