Last month , the precious legal doctrine known as the " hate crime " officially got out of control . 
Two eighteen-year-old <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> youths were charged with " second-degree assault as a hate crime " after they jumped out of a car , yelled " Hey Satan ! " 
to a self-proclaimed Satanist wearing black clothes and an upside-down crucifix and proceeded to beat him with a club and an ice scraper . 
While the act was certainly abhorrent , the prosecutor 's response in charging the two with a hate crime illustrates both the illogical nature of hate crimes as well as the uneven standards with which they are assessed . 
The prosecutor in the case eventually decided to drop the hate crimes charge against the two youths but the initial decision to designate the incident as a hate crime speaks to a broader problem . 
By classifying an attack on a Satanist as a hate crime , a similar crime on a member of a non-protected class of individuals , say non-Satanists , is implicitly denigrated . 
Under hate crimes statues , an individual who , for example , murders a member of a protected class ( read : non-majority ) because of their race , religion , sex , etc. , is given a harsher sentence than someone who murders a member of a non-protected class . 
But by doing so , society implies that the life of the person who was n't a member of the protected class is worth less than the victim who was , because their killer received a more lenient sentence . 
Another problem with hate crimes is their shockingly uneven distribution . 
While the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> Uniform Crime Reports Program logs hundreds of crimes motivated by race , religion and other factors each year , there are several high-profile crimes that are notably absent from the hate crimes register . 
In <DATE>1989</DATE> , a female who would later be known as the <LOCATION>Central Park</LOCATION> jogger was attacked by a group of teenagers , gang-raped and left for dead . 
During the <DATE>1992</DATE> L.A. riots , cameras captured a group of individuals drag truck-driver <PERSON>Reginald Denny</PERSON> out of his vehicle and smash his head with a brick . 
Testimony showed the attack was racially-motivated , that the group even passed on attacking the driver before <PERSON>Denny</PERSON> because the driver was black . 
Finally , in <DATE>April of 2000</DATE> , an 8-year old boy , <PERSON>Kevin Shifflet</PERSON> was brutally stabbed to death in his front yard by an attacker who uttered racial epithets as he slashed <PERSON>Shifflet</PERSON> 's throat . 
The common denominator in all three of these cases : the victim was white , the assailant ( s ) were black or Hispanic and were not charged with a hate crime . 
" Hate Crimes : Criminal Law and Identity Politics , " a book by <PERSON>James Jacobs</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kimberly Potter</PERSON> offers revealing statistics in the arena of interracial crime and hate crimes . 
In <DATE>2000</DATE> , the study found that <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of interracial violent crime involved black offenders and white victims , <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> were white offenders and black victims and the other <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> were different combinations . 
Such a discrepancy is n't entirely shocking ; after all , there are about six times as many non-Hispanic Caucasians in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> as African-Americans . 
What is shocking is that in <DATE>1998</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> reported 2,084 " anti-black " hate crimes committed by whites and 567 " anti-white " hate crimes committed by blacks . 
In other words , despite the fact that crimes committed by blacks against whites occur seven times as much as the opposite , someone from the latter category -- a crime committed by whites against blacks -- is four times as likely to be charged with a hate crime . 
This demonstrates that hate crimes seem to be nothing more than crimes committed by one of a majority against a minority . 
The relevance the national debate on hate crimes has to our own University can not be forgotten . 
Student Council President <PERSON>Noah Sullivan</PERSON> is currently pursuing a referendum that would call for harsher punishments for students prosecuted in the <ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> system if their offense is classified as a hate crime . 
But the text of the referendum limits a hate crime to an offense motivated by hatred based on " race , ethnicity , gender , sexual orientation , religion or disability . " 
If these factors are valid , then so should others be , like political orientation . 
There were several well-documented cases last semester of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> supporters having their respective signs torn down . 
Surely the students who committed such acts were motivated based on political hatred . 
Maybe we should legislate that crimes against people who wear glasses should be a hate crime . 
The point here is not to belittle the victims of the abhorrent crimes that do occur , but to demonstrate that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and society as a whole should not be in the business of legislating who is and who is n't a member of a protected class . 
Proponents of hate crimes legislation point out that , for example , a religiously-motivated crime against a Christian is in fact a crime against the entire Christian community . 
But a crime is a crime , regardless of the victim 's race , religion or sex ; it 's why the lady justice statue outside <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> is wearing a blindfold and thus blind to both the perpetrator and the victim 's demographics . 
All crimes are bad , especially violent ones , but that 's why we have existing laws that cover these infractions , and that 's why hate crime laws are redundant and unnecessary .
