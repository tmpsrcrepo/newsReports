The FX original , <ORGANIZATION>American Horror Story</ORGANIZATION> , is a show that is not afraid to transcend conventional television by breaking boundaries and addressing controversial topics . 
Though <ORGANIZATION>American Horror Story</ORGANIZATION> is known on the surface for its shock value , it is much more than that . 
Throughout the seasons , <ORGANIZATION>American Horror Story</ORGANIZATION> has featured topics such as sexuality , religion , misogyny , rape , racism , the stigma of mental illness and now the stigma of the physically disabled . 
Each season not only displays these difficult topics , but also simultaneously highlights the brilliance of the marginalized groups and underlines the evil of those who discriminate against them . 
Although there are creepy scenes , these scenes also allow for extensive analysis . 
Season one , set in a haunted house , portrayed depression and adultery . 
Season two , set in a mental institution in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> , dealt with mental illness , religious conflict and homosexuality . 
Season three surrounded the lives of witches and used strong , female characters to defy misogyny , and also used flashbacks to illustrate the horror of slavery and racism . 
In this season in particular , American Horror Story : Freak Show , the word " freak " is used not to denigrate the disabled , but to expose the onlookers . 
This season is about a group of disabled people who work in an Circus-esq attraction in <ORGANIZATION>Jupiter</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> ( my hometown ) in <DATE>1952</DATE> . 
What makes these people " freaks " is not their physical differences , but rather the audience 's perception of them . 
In the show so far , the people who witness the attraction are mesmerized and bewildered by what they see as physical anomalies . 
However , these same people are shown to be selfish and , ultimately , discriminatory . 
The word " freak " used to describe the characters is not maliciously intended for the disabled , but instead meant to expose the " freaks " who pay to watch the show , enjoy the dehumanizing display and leave grinning and satisfied - the people who judge , ridicule and see the disabled as sub-human . 
Other seasons also use this approach , such as in season two where the patients in the mental institution are the protagonists , while the hegemonic figures , such as the doctors and institution administrators , are corrupt , and quite literally possessed by the devil . 
Additionally , <ORGANIZATION>American Horror Story</ORGANIZATION> is known for hiring a diverse cast . 
Co-creator and Executive Producer <PERSON>Ryan Murphy</PERSON> has said that this well-researched fourth season is no exception . 
<ORGANIZATION>American Horror Story</ORGANIZATION> also does a good job of producing " behind-the-scenes " documentaries about the real lives and successes of their disabled actors . 
<PERSON>Maysoon Zayid</PERSON> , a comedian and actress with Cerebral palsy , in a recent TED talk , spoke about her struggles as well as her discouragement with <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood</ORGANIZATION> . 
In college , <PERSON>Zayid</PERSON> was turned down for the role of a woman with CP . 
She said , " This was a part that I was literally born to play , and they gave it to a non-palsy actress ! 
College was imitating life . 
Hollywood has a sordid history of casting abled-bodied actors to play disabled on screen . " 
She continued , " If a wheelchair user ca n't play Beyonc Ã © , then Beyonc Ã © ca n't play a wheelchair user . " 
Zayid 's point underlines just how important it is that American Horror Story cast real people with real disabilities . 
As <PERSON>Zayid</PERSON> said , " The disabled are the largest minority in the world and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment , " and American Horror Story successfully illuminates the realities of the disabled and the difficulties they endure , using real , disabled people . 
That is not the only way <ORGANIZATION>American Horror Story</ORGANIZATION> uses its power to advocate on behalf of the disabled , though . 
<PERSON>Jamie Brewer</PERSON> , a young actress on <ORGANIZATION>American Horror Story</ORGANIZATION> who has Down Syndrome , used her fame gained from her television appearances to become more active in the Down Syndrome community . 
She was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION>State of Texas ARC Board</ORGANIZATION> and spoke at the <ORGANIZATION>Texas State Capitol</ORGANIZATION> to persuade them to pass a law for <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> to abolish the word " retarded " from state legislation . 
The effort was successful and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> now uses the term " intellectual developmental disability " in their legislation . 
It is easy to assume that <ORGANIZATION>American Horror Story</ORGANIZATION> is purposefully being offensive when it presents such crude storylines , but such an artificial analysis of the show is unfair . 
Once you watch an episode , it becomes clear that the generally marginalized group is instead framed as the underdog - the people we root for to succeed . 
We see through their eyes and are made to hate the onlookers , those of society who condemn the disabled . 
No one watching Freak Show will finish an episode on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> and believe disabled people are truly " freaks . " 
There is far too much character development for the audience to be that narrow-minded . 
I recognize that <ORGANIZATION>American Horror Story</ORGANIZATION> is tough to handle on the outside , but on the inside it is an impressive commentary on American society spanning many different decades throughout its seasons .
