" The Glass House " is a thriller that is n't particularly thrilling . 
While there is nothing actually wrong with this film , and many things right , it 's incomplete and therefore somewhat crippled . 
" House " is the story of two children -- 16-year-old <PERSON>Ruby Baker</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>Leelee Sobieski</LOCATION> ) and her 11-year-old brother , <PERSON>Rhett</PERSON> ( <PERSON>Trevor Morgan</PERSON> ) -- who are orphaned when their parents die in a car accident . 
Their former neighbors are appointed as guardians and , after agreeing to take the children in , turn out to be less harmless than they seem . 
The events of the film are straightforward and nowhere near thrilling . 
" House " is at times visually extraordinary but never obtrusively so . 
Much of the story takes place in the guardians ' <LOCATION>Malibu</LOCATION> house , which is annoyingly symbolic in its use of glass and transparency , and while quite beautiful in daylight , achieves a sufficiently sinister note in darkness . 
Any other significant scenes occur within expensive automobiles or the purposes of both defining the guardians as wealthy , and exploring the heroine 's struggle with learning to drive after her parents ' accident . 
Themes also arising in the film , though mostly unimportant to the general plot , include the teenage rebellion , plagiarism , sibling rivalry , sexual abuse and drug use . 
" House " does a remarkable job depicting the utter dependence that children have on their parents for all manner of care ; the film also shows how pure the parent/child relationship must be by focusing on the pollution brought on by lies and manipulation . 
Cast performances are solid throughout with notable quality evidenced by both <LOCATION>Sobieski</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Stellan Skarsgard</ORGANIZATION> ( playing <PERSON>Terry Glass</PERSON> , the children 's evil guardian ) . 
Sobieski succeeds in drawing out her character 's somewhat rowdy past , while also creating a believable heroine . 
Skarsgard plays his part beautifully by creating a pure-at-heart faade before deftly allowing deceit to manifest . 
He turns in an incredible and consistent performance . 
The rest of the cast does not disappoint with believable but mostly unremarkable performances . 
What troubles me most about this film is how incomplete its ending is . 
Much of the movie rests on the somewhat idealistic foundation that one should ultimately take personal responsibility and try very hard not to destroy the lives of others . 
Viewers are to feel sorry and outraged at the treatment the children receive at the hand of the guardians . 
The deceased parents ' values of honesty and forth-rightness are impressed upon the children and delivered to the audience through the heroine 's actions . 
The film ends , and therefore finds resolution , in an act that , in many ways , is more wrong than any of the events prior . 
The film 's conclusion is hypocritical and unexplored in such a way that the viewer is left wondering if the director , <PERSON>Daniel Sackheim</PERSON> , wished to make a statement about the importance of morals or the difficulty in following convictions . 
Perhaps <PERSON>Sackheim</PERSON> quite simply went for blood rather than finding a meaningful resolution to this story . 
" House " has a number of possibly unintentional things to say about wealthy culture in and around <LOCATION>Malibu</LOCATION> . 
After every instance in which an individual is seen driving an expensive car or living in an extravagant house , the viewer finds out that he or she did horrible things to pay for it or even stole it outright . 
Nothing good is said about the wealthy ; the only wealthy people portrayed positively live in a small house and are considered thrifty . 
As a rule , the film suggests that money is a good thing to have but is something to hide for fear of shame . 
" House " is not a horribly bad movie and has some entertaining moments , but it is not without numerous problems . 
This movie is supposed to be a thriller , and it should , in its unfoldings , maintain an element of surprise . 
Unfortunately it succeeds at neither of these things . 
Therefore , it 's a pretty boring movie to watch as anything other than an academic exercise , like solving a high school algebra equation . 
You know how it will finish before you start , and you know exactly how you 're going to get there . 
Sometimes the experience is interesting , and sometimes it 's horrible . 
This movie is n't bad , but it could have been much better .
