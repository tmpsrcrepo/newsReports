<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily The <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> convened in full sessions <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> and afternoon to hear <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> updates and discuss a recent report on higher education issued by the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission</ORGANIZATION> . 
JLARC was charged with studying the cost efficiency of 15 four-year institutions to identify opportunities to reduce the cost of higher education in the commonwealth . 
The report said <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> lacked efficient spending in some capacities . 
" The folks at the state level are saying to the institutions that have the means to do so ... [ to ] be more responsible for your long-term financial ability , " Board member <PERSON>Frank Atkinson</PERSON> said . 
Board member <PERSON>Helen Dragas</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> is focused on " how to deliver <PERCENT>120 percent</PERCENT> of the quality [ of education ] at <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of the cost . " 
Board member <ORGANIZATION>Frank Genovese</ORGANIZATION> expressed concern that JLARC did not include institutional quality as a primary factor of evaluation . 
" It 's time to call the fairness doctrine if they really want to go after us , " <PERSON>Genovese</PERSON> said . 
" It 's just not right . " 
In response , <PERSON>Dragas</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> needed to take the JLARC findings seriously . 
" I think that sometimes we hurt ourselves by this sort of U.Va . 
exceptionalism argument , and it comes across to the rest of the world as if ... maybe things do n't apply to us because our quality is higher , " <PERSON>Dragas</PERSON> said . 
Board member <PERSON>Kevin Fay</PERSON> said there is " a fine line between confidence and arrogance , and we need to be careful not to cross it , but we also do n't need to be apologetic for being confident . " 
" We have to be on the offensive , " <PERSON>Fay</PERSON> said . 
Atkinson agreed the JLARC report needed to be taken seriously , but had different ideas on how to proceed . 
" We need to take this to heart , understand it , " <PERSON>Atkinson</PERSON> said . 
" We need to recognize that JLARC , although important , is not the only player in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> . 
... It was just as much a criticism of the general assembly and its choices and procedures for allocating capital investment as it is a criticism of the institution . " 
Dragas highlighted a portion of the report which called for greater <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> engagement . 
" I really do n't think we want to get involved in such nitty gritty management issues , " Board member <PERSON>Barbara Fried</PERSON> said in response . 
Dragas replied , " What I hear in very broad terms is that something is n't working . " 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Meg Gould</PERSON> , the student member of the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> , also gave an update on recent student life at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , outlining various initiatives to combat sexual assault and the launch of the <ORGANIZATION>Substance Abuse Prevention Week</ORGANIZATION> . 
University President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> updated the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> on the Cornerstone plan , including the <PERSON>Meriwether Lewis</PERSON> Leadership program , which will begin in <DATE>Spring 2015</DATE> . 
" We 've got a number of programs underway that are focused on career issues , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said , " particularly in getting students engaged in their first and second year in thinking about careers . " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> also delivered the Gifts and Grants report . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has matched the <MONEY>$ 4 million</MONEY> Challenge Grant for the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Ridge Scholarship Foundation</ORGANIZATION> from alumnus <PERSON>John Griffin</PERSON> . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said the grant was matched in nine months . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> passed each item on its docket , including the establishment of several new professorships and the acquisition of a new property .
