The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> unveiled a new global internship program <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> . 
By drawing on friends , alumni and partner organizations across the world , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> plans to help place students in international internships . 
These internships will last a <DATE>summer</DATE> or an entire semester and will span professional settings from research centers to corporations . 
The opportunity to work abroad as a student is fantastic-if you can afford it . 
That wo n't be the case for many <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students . 
<PERSON>Majida Bargach</PERSON> , the quadrilingual director of the global internships program , has already said most of the internships will " probably be unpaid . " 
An unpaid internship in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> can be a financial strain for American students ; an unpaid internship in another country carries with it new costs , including travel . 
Who are the students who will be able to afford an unpaid internship abroad ? 
Probably the same students who can already afford to travel with their families . 
As for the students who , for financial reasons , come to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> with little or no international experience , this program will not help them . 
The fact that the program seems likely to give a boost to students who are already economically " ahead " is not a reason to dismiss it wholesale . 
More foreign exposure is valuable for all students . 
Many of our peers will work in multiple countries over the course of their careers . 
Forging professional connections abroad is a way to expand employment horizons while also learning more about the world . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is wise to capitalize on its friends and partners in other countries : the global internships program widens students ' job prospects while also offering them opportunities for cultural and intellectual development . 
It combines the best of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> 's career-services efforts with the school 's academic mission . 
And <PERSON>Bargach</PERSON> seems to recognize that access is a problem . 
She told <ORGANIZATION>UVA Today</ORGANIZATION> she is considering offering grants and pursuing fundraising efforts so that less well-off students will be able to participate . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is not wrong to launch such a program . 
On the contrary : if the program is a success , it will help many students immeasurably . 
The underlying problem is not that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will place students in unpaid internships but that unpaid internships have become a labor norm . 
And the underlying party at fault is not <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> but the many firms that employ young people for no compensation : no money , no benefits and no legal protection against harassment or discrimination . 
Between housing , travel , food , professional clothing and other expenses-especially if the internship is in an expensive city like <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> or Paris-an unpaid foreign internship could cost a student five figures . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> offers a few scholarships for students doing unpaid summer internships , such as the <PERSON>Larry Simpson</PERSON> Internship Scholarship ( <MONEY>$ 2,200</MONEY> ; only rising fourth years are eligible ) and <ORGANIZATION>Parents Committee</ORGANIZATION> grants ( <MONEY>$ 3,000</MONEY> each , for second and third years doing public service internships ) . 
Upping the number of internship scholarships could allow a few more students to participate in the global internships program . 
But these scholarships are partial fixes for a flawed system . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should not have to provide internship stipends . 
That responsibility should lie with the employer . 
The arguments against unpaid internships are many . 
Critics of unpaid internships have argued , variously , that : a ) such arrangements are inherently exploitative ; b ) they damage social mobility by requiring a period of unpaid work as a prerequisite for entering an industry ; c ) they displace paid workers ; d ) unpaid interns often lack accountability and get saddled with menial tasks , and so on . 
The arguments in favor of unpaid internships are also numerous . 
Some contend that unpaid internships are a win-win : that such arrangements let students gain experience in a professional field and potentially set themselves up for a future job . 
In some countries , such as <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , it is difficult for American students to hold paid internships because of visa rules . 
But in countries where it 's possible , we believe that employers should pay interns for their work . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will surely promote the global internships program when discussing the school 's career services , global initiatives and <DATE>summer</DATE> opportunities . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> thus benefits , in a minor way , from the practice of unpaid internships . 
Because we 're left wondering : would these friends and alumni and partner organizations be so willing to hire <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students if they had to pay them ?
