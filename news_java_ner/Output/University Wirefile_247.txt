On the heels of protests and increased media attention to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual assault policy , the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Leadership Council</ORGANIZATION> held a " community concerns " meeting <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in the Physics building to collect input . 
The meeting consisted of small group discussions headed by various leaders of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> groups associated with sexual assault topics . 
SALC Chair <PERSON>Sloane Kuney</PERSON> said the purpose of the meeting was to compile the community 's input on changing the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's policy regarding sexual assault into a draft to send to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administrators . 
<PERSON>Kuney</PERSON> said the meeting stemmed from the <ORGANIZATION>SALC</ORGANIZATION> 's contact with <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administrators , who wished to receive input from certain students on new drafts of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> sexual assault policies . 
She said the SALC felt that not enough students were chosen by the administration to give effective input . 
" We feel that the idea [ of sexual assault reform ] should be as democratically open as possibly as to giving feedback to the administration , " <PERSON>Kuney</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Lauren Russo</PERSON> , who headed the discussion of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> 's confidentiality issues , said the general mood of the people giving her input was anger and frustration toward the status quo . 
Current <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> policy requires confidentiality of the content of sexual assault hearings and verdicts delivered against the accused . 
<PERSON>Russo</PERSON> said the group discussed reforms to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's confidential disclosure policy , including an interest in allowing sexual assault survivors the " right to disclose the results and content " of <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> hearings . 
She added that her group suggested the result of <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> proceedings be made " semi-public " to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community -- the names of those found guilty of sexual assault or sexual misconduct would be compiled on a list available to restricted individuals . 
However , <PERSON>Russo</PERSON> said that the group wanted more serious punishments to be made widely known to the community . 
" Everyone agrees that if you 're expelled from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> for sexual assault , it should be made public , " she said . 
<PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , coordinator of sexual assault education at the Women 's Center , described the current state of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> sexual assault policy as a " multi-layered problem . " 
She said <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has certain legal responsibilities that it has to meet , including an adjudication system and due process for those accused . 
She added that these responsibilities are coupled with " the duty to protect survivors . " 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said that in looking at the current policy , the adjudication process needs to be more transparent , yet offer a climate of safety for sexual assault survivors . 
She also added that in dealing with sexual assault , men should " hold their brothers accountable " in teaching a new concept of masculinity . 
" How often you score is not the measure of how masculine you are , " she said . 
" It 's how you treat other people -- that 's the measure of a man . " 
<PERSON>Kuney</PERSON> said the feedback obtained <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> will also be sent to various <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> groups . 
From there , SALC would look for a second round of feedback before a final draft of suggestions would be created .
