Courtesy <ORGANIZATION>Virginia.edu University Psychology</ORGANIZATION> Prof. <PERSON>Joseph Allen</PERSON> drafted a bill of rights for survivors of sexual assault summarizing the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's existing policy on sexual misconduct . 
In the wake of the recent Rolling Stone article , which called the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual assault policies into question , <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> said he found the policy daunting and hoped rewriting the policy in a more clear , concise manner would make it more accessible to students . 
<PERSON>Allen</PERSON> said he hopes this will encourage more survivors to come forward with their stories . 
Reporting instances of sexual assault ultimately makes the community safer , he said . 
" Survivors who come forward can not only hold individual perpetrators accountable , they can prevent future assaults by breaking the culture of silence that lets some perpetrators feel they can act with impunity , " <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Allen</PERSON> said making these policies more accessible to the public might even lead to fewer acts of sexual violence . 
" If potential perpetrators believe that their vile acts will become publicly known , they will be far less likely to go through with them , " he said . 
<PERSON>Allen</PERSON> said his hope in drafting the bill is for students to reject the negative stigma some associate with reporting instances of sexual assault , and to instead recognize that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> stands in solidarity with survivors . " 
[ Survivors ] fear they wo n't get adequate support for the stresses that coming forward will create , " <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> said . 
" If you choose to come forward , we wo n't leave you hanging . " 
<PERSON>Allen</PERSON> said he is optimistic members of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community will step up and take the change many feel is desperately needed . 
" Together , we can create a culture of accountability , and of support for survivors , " <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> said . 
" We have the capacity to dramatically reduce this problem and improve the quality and reputation of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> at the same time . "
