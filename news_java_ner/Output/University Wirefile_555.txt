Cavalier Daily The <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> community and the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> participated in Giving <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> yesterday , joining in on a global day dedicated to giving . 
Giving <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> was established in <DATE>2012</DATE> as a response to the consumer-driven shopping days surrounding Thanksgiving : Black <DATE>Friday</DATE> and Cyber <DATE>Monday</DATE> . 
The philanthropic day is meant to be one of celebrating generosity . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has taken up its own version of the national day of philanthropy - Giving ToHoosDay - in which students , alumni and parents are encouraged to donate to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> organizations and sponsored charities or groups . 
On the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's Giving ToHoosDay website , users can directly follow a link to make a donation to one or several of designated foundations on Grounds . 
Need-based scholarships , Faculty Support , <ORGANIZATION>Jefferson Grounds Initiative and Diversity and Equity Programs</ORGANIZATION> are a few of the options listed on the site . 
Users can provide special instruction about the donation should they want to . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Advancement</ORGANIZATION> is the central fundraising operation on Grounds , though there are a total of 15 University-related foundations which raise money on behalf of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Robert Sweeney</PERSON> , senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION>University Advancement</ORGANIZATION> , said communications regarding <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> donations have been tightened , given the recent protests and fervor surrounding the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's handling of sexual assault cases . 
" We toned down our communications plan around the day , a plan that was , by design , fun and chatty and creative - but that approach seemed frivolous in light of all that 's happening in our world right now , " <PERSON>Sweeney</PERSON> said in an email . 
" But we did not suspend the initiative . " 
Some donors who decline to make a gift have referenced the Rolling Stone article , which detailed graphic cases of sexual assault and sparked a wave of reactions across the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , but <PERSON>Sweeney</PERSON> said many individuals have still had positive responses . 
" Some do share their anger , yet quickly ask how they can help be part of the solution , " <PERSON>Sweeney</PERSON> said . 
Donors can choose to give to the Women 's <ORGANIZATION>Center 's Sexual Assault Education Center</ORGANIZATION> or other advocacy groups on Grounds . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Alumni Association and University Advancement</ORGANIZATION> are not the only On-Grounds groups involved in Giving ToHoosDay . 
Class Giving is an annual campaign run by <ORGANIZATION>Fourth Year Trustees</ORGANIZATION> which aims to foster a culture of giving to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> by encouraging philanthropy in fourth years . 
This past week , Class Giving has participated in outreach for Giving ToHoosDay through social media and word of mouth . 
Class Giving Trustee <PERSON>Paige McDermott</PERSON> , a fourth-year <PERSON>Batten</PERSON> student , said the outreach of Class Giving is designed to be largely personalized . 
" The goal is to talk to as many fourth years as we can and tell them they have a way to donate , " <PERSON>McDermott</PERSON> said . 
" We try to target specific groups , anywhere we feel like someone would want to give back . " 
Though the Class Giving campaign itself is yearlong , <ORGANIZATION>Giving ToHoosDay</ORGANIZATION> is a chance to increase awareness and have students donate in the name of an organization or charity and have it go toward the Class Giving campaign as well . 
" Our goal is n't a certain dollar amount , " <PERSON>McDermott</PERSON> said . 
" It 's a certain percentage of the class . 
Our goal is to get to 100 percent participation . " 
Last year , a total of <PERCENT>81 percent</PERCENT> the fourth-year class donated . 
As of right now , <PERCENT>19 percent</PERCENT> of the Class of <DATE>2015</DATE> has donated . 
<PERSON>McDermott</PERSON> said Trustees are hoping to reach <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> before the holiday break .
