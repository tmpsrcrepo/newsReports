<PERSON>Bob Brown</PERSON> | <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> Times-Dispatch <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> is in the process of crafting legislation which will alter how incidents of sexual assault are handled on college campuses . 
A set of bills recently incorporated into <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Bill 712 provide an example of how some legislators wish to sidestep the school as part of the process of an investigation into sexual assault . 
The senate bills would require school employees - with the exception of certain counselors , attorneys and religious officials - to notify police of an incident of sexual assault within 24 hours , even if that information was obtained in confidence . 
Senators in support of the bills argue that sexual assault is a crime , and therefore criminal proceedings should be initiated immediately to have the best chance at collecting the evidence needed for a conviction . 
Critics of the bills say that this approach is misguided because it overlooks the safeguards schools have at their disposal for survivors . 
<PERSON>Claire Wyatt</PERSON> , a <ORGANIZATION>2013 University</ORGANIZATION> graduate and an organizer for advocacy group <ORGANIZATION>New Virginia Majority</ORGANIZATION> , said mandatory reporting could unintentionally deter reports of sexual assault because police departments often lack the sensitivity required in rape cases . 
" Ninety percent of assault survivors who go to the police have a retraumatizing moment in their initial intake questioning by police , " <PERSON>Wyatt</PERSON> said . 
Many universities use administrative levers such as moving survivors between dorms to help survivors avoid interactions with their attackers . 
Universities may also implement " no contact " directives , which are similar to restraining orders . 
Though these measures carry no legal weight , they aim provide immediate protections to survivors to help foster a safer atmosphere for the student . 
<PERSON>Wyatt</PERSON> said rather than face severe questioning and doubt , survivors may not speak openly with investigators . 
Until police departments are trained with better trauma-based investigation techniques , sexual assault survivors could face harmful revictimization under mandatory reporting , upsetting the recovery process . 
House Bill <DATE>1343</DATE> , introduced by <LOCATION>Del</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Eileen Filler-Corn</PERSON> , D-Fairfax , earlier this month , is an alternative approach to mandatory reporting . 
This bill strikes a better balance between protecting the community from threat and keeping the process in the hands of the survivor , <PERSON>Wyatt</PERSON> said . 
The bill requires campus police and local law enforcement agencies to contact local commonwealth attorneys within 48 hours of a reported incident of sexual assault . 
The bill is currently in subcommittee . " 
[ This bill ] will make it easier for students to access legal recourse and prevent police from not pushing a case forward , " <PERSON>Wyatt</PERSON> said . 
<ORGANIZATION>House Bill 1343</ORGANIZATION> has received broad support and is viewed as favorable for sexual assault survivors because it only applies to cases where the crime has already been reported . 
As a result , the reported cases are more likely to be prosecuted . 
" Whereas [ SB712 ] would act as a deterrent to coming forward , this bill adds an element of accountability , " <PERSON>Wyatt</PERSON> said . 
Gov. <PERSON>Terry McAuliffe</PERSON> created a campus sexual assault task force last year which is set to release its findings for best practices in <DATE>June</DATE> . 
<PERSON>Wyatt</PERSON> said that once experts pinpoint specific problems , the legislature will be able to create more informed bills .
