A report describing the pervasivness of sexual harassment and job discrimination in the army was released <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> by an internal investigation committee . 
These findings have provoked outrage among many , but they also have fueled the fire of anti-gender integration sentiments , directed at both military personnel and civilians . 
These individuals point to instances of sexual misconduct as proof of the undesirability of altering military gender boundaries . 
Those reactions should be expected . 
Reactionary blame is always an easy answer . 
It , however , provides no real solutions . 
Sexual harassment and gender discrimination should not be blamed on the women entering the army or even on the individual men who were not prepared to accept them . 
The armed services are a branch of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> government and it was , therefore , the government 's responsibility to ensure that a zero tolerance policy toward sexual misconduct was implemented and enforced . 
The survey reports that <PERCENT>72 percent</PERCENT> of women and <PERCENT>63 percent</PERCENT> of men feel they have encountered sexist behavior during their experiences in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> . 
That figure indicates that offensive behavior and harassment have crossed gender lines . 
It is argued by some as proof of inherent obstacles impeding the shift to co-educational training . 
They claim women should not serve alongside men , not because the men are sexist or abusive , but because both sexes have proven incapable of handling the responsibility of interaction . 
There are two major flaws in that line of reasoning . 
Integration , whether intended to undo racial , gender or any other long standing division , inevitably will be an arduous process . 
Using problems that arise to justify the previous system is unacceptable . 
After the <DATE>1954</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Brown v. Board of Education</ORGANIZATION> decision , few were surprised by the difficulties and dangers students faced in the wake of de-segregation . 
Those dangers , however , did not make the former racist system preferable to the reformed one . 
Rather , they required the government take special precautions and preventive measures to minimize confrontations , precautions and measures that have not been made to successfully incorporate women into the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> . 
The government not only should take a more active role in eliminating discrimination and harassment in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> , but also must examine the causes of an atmosphere where such occurrences are commonplace . 
Army Chief of Staff <PERSON>Dennis J. Reimer</PERSON> , in <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> , blamed this atmosphere on " organizational faults brought on by downsizing , leadership failures for selective individuals and the need to place more emphasis on values . " 
Whatever the cause , the level of disrespect and insensitivity that must exist for such wide spread abuse to occur should not be permitted in any American institution . 
How can the army protect American ideals and values from foreign threats , when the army itself fails to reflect American ideals and values ? 
The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> believes it has identified one cause of sexism in its branches and has taken action to amend it . 
The survey revealed many men 's agitation at what they interpreted as preferential treatment for women in the service . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> reported that physical fitness requirements for women in the army were widely ridiculed and considered easy , even for those women who are overweight and smoke . 
In response , <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> officials have increased the difficulty of the annual fitness test female soldiers must pass . 
This sort of initiative is a positive example of addressing the problem 's source . 
It is , however , by no means comprehensive . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> must educate all soldiers of the unacceptability and dire consequences resulting from sexual harassment . 
The government must take a more active role in examining standards of behavior and ensuring those standards are met . 
The <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> was required to enforce and monitor the desegregation of <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION> schools . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> has proven that it too requires the oversight of another institution for the integration of women . 
The surfacing scandals have not proven women 's incompatibility with military values . 
They have , rather , illustrated the incompatability of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's values with those of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> .
