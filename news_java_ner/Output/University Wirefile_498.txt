Photo by <PERSON>Thomas Bynum</PERSON> Update <TIME>2:25 p.m.</TIME> : <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity released a statement <DATE>Thursday</DATE> saying the organization had voluntarily suspended its <ORGANIZATION>Fraternal Organization Agreement</ORGANIZATION> . 
" This is a serious matter for the criminal justice system and the university investigative process and we will cooperate quickly , openly , and honestly in any forthcoming investigation that may be conducted , " the statement read . 
Read the full statement here . 
University President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> asked the <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Department</ORGANIZATION> to investigate an incident of sexual misconduct between a then-first-year student and several members of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity which allegedly occurred in <DATE>September 2012</DATE> . 
The incident was the subject of an article published online <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> by <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone Magazine</ORGANIZATION> - an article which also detailed numerous other assaults which allegedly took place at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Testimony from now third-year <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> detailed a violent gang rape at the hands of seven <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> brothers during her first semester on Grounds . 
It outlines her experiences dealing with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> following the incident , as well as the reactions of her peers and subsequent interactions she had with one of the men involved in her assault . 
The article elicited a momentous response from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> - with some highly critical of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's response to the accusations , others lambasting the Greek community for its apparent fostering of sexual misconduct , and still others criticizing the reporter for her methods and her portrayal of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> life . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Response Against Phi Kappa Psi Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> 's national leadership released a statement <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> expressing concern over the allegations in the article and promising to investigate the matter seriously . 
The fraternity has launched an independent investigation " intended to determine the facts surrounding these allegations . " 
" As distressing as these allegations are to us , we recognize that the personal stress and anxiety experienced by any survivor of an assault dwarfs our own , " the organization 's press release said . 
" It is important to note that to our knowledge there have been no criminal investigations or charges of sexual assault brought against any member of the chapter . " 
<LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Police Capt. <PERSON>Gary Pleasants</PERSON> said an investigation is not underway at this time ; however , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has submitted a request for an investigation . 
Title IX bars the <ORGANIZATION>University Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> from investigating or adjudicating any claim made about sexual assault under the <ORGANIZATION>IFC Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Phi <ORGANIZATION>Psi</ORGANIZATION> has conducted their response primarily internally , " said <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Tommy Reid</PERSON> , a fourth-year College student . 
" We have continued , as we did way before the article was brought to our attention , to enforce bystander intervention programs and education initiatives to reduce the incidence of sexual misconduct . " 
Third-year College student <PERSON>Sara Surface</PERSON> , external chair of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition</ORGANIZATION> , said the Greek system needs improvement to better serve the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community as a whole . 
" No one is trying to villainize the Greek system , " she said . 
" But we need to acknowledge the good and the bad things about a particular system . 
Can fraternities be a place for brotherhood ? 
Yes . 
But can they also be spaces for sexual assault ? 
Yes . " 
<PERSON>Reid</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> has taken multiple initiatives against sexual assault under his administration involving chapter presidents , younger leaders in chapters , risk managers , vice presidents and fraternity members . 
" I believe that gender norms contribute predominantly to acts of sexual violence , " <PERSON>Reid</PERSON> said . 
" Fraternities in some cases latently reinforce gender norms ... However , I think fraternities are designed better than any other student organizations to act as vehicles for bystander intervention . 
Specifically , looking out for one another , and taking pride in how a community has the responsibility to ensure the safety of each one of its members . " 
<PERSON>Reid</PERSON> said he admired the survivors who told their stories to Rolling Stone and hopes their testimony will effect change . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> recognizes a necessity to change the culture surrounding gender norms and power structure on Grounds , " he said . 
" The survivors ... have done a lot for spreading that realization . " 
A <ORGANIZATION>Debate of Accuracy Surface</ORGANIZATION> , who in addition to her work for the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition</ORGANIZATION> also works with the peer education group One Less , said she was troubled by calls she heard questioning the validity of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's claims . 
" It 's hard to know right now . 
I would say if [ the article ] gives survivors a place where they feel like , ' Hey , the girls in the article shared their stories , ' that they will now be validated and believed . 
That 's a positive outcome , " she said . 
" That 's why I 'm worried about the comments like , ' It 's not true ' or ' She 's lying . ' 
Rather than the administration discouraging reporting , it 's the student body that discourages reporting when they make comments that do n't support survivors . " 
Surface said students questioning the accuracy of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's claims should keep in mind that only a small percentage of rape reports are false . 
She said many survivors of sexual assault , like <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> , never file a police report because of the re-victimization that often comes with doing so . 
Fostering a Dialogue Fourth-year <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Brian Head</PERSON> , president of sexual assault prevention advocacy group One in Four , said despite the fact that the article was " emotionally provocative to a lot of people , " it was worthwhile in that it sparked meaningful conversation . 
" The opposite of love is not hate , it is indifference , " Head said , quoting author and Holocaust survivor <PERSON>Elie Wiesel</PERSON> . 
" Even though the reactions to the article are all over the board , they give me hope that the community around us can change . 
... The fact that people are sharing this and talking about this shows me that they care , and that makes me hopeful . " 
Head said that the criticisms of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> can prove beneficial . 
" This is a scathing portrayal of our university , " Head said . 
" These reactions can be seen as the red , and they can be made a net positive . 
But we have to direct these conversations in a certain way . " 
Surface said <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students often have misunderstandings about the resources available to them , and this can lead to misconceptions and misunderstandings about the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual misconduct policies . 
" For so long , conversations around activism have been largely dominated by members of One Less and One in Four , and it feels quite overwhelming now , knowing how many of these conversations [ about the article ] are happening and how many of them might be misinformed , " Surface said . 
" Knowing that our small scale prevention and education efforts so far might be undermined . " 
Surface said that while greater attention should have been paid in the article to activism groups on Grounds , the piece provided an avenue for advocates to educate their peers about gaps in the discourse about rape and sexual assault . 
For that , she said , the article was valuable . 
Surface said One Less and One in Four are working together to craft a response to show community support for survivors of sexual assault in wake of the article . 
" Ultimately , we want survivors to be supported within the community and to feel like it 's a safe space to share their voice , " she said . 
Surface said <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> hopes other survivors will come forward in light of the article and seek appropriate resources . 
The Reporter Herself The author of the article , <PERSON>Sabrina Rubin Erdely</PERSON> , is a contributing editor at Rolling Stone . 
She said she chose to focus her investigative piece on the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> because of its academic reputation . 
" I was looking for a school that was elite , a school people look up to , but also where the culture felt representative of what 's going on around the country , " she said . 
" I wanted a school being investigated for Title IX , and on top of all that I needed people to be willing to talk with me about their experiences with sexual assault . 
U.Va . 
filled the bill on all fronts . " 
Erdely said the stories she heard about the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> were disturbing , but not worse than similar occurrences at other schools around the country . 
She began gathering interviews and documents during the <DATE>summer</DATE> and worked on the article for about five months . 
In that period of time , she visited <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , spoke with advocates and administrators and even ventured down Rugby Road . 
" I hope people will see this not as an assault on fraternity culture - fraternities are n't bad in themselves - but a lot of bad behavior towards women is tolerated , " she said . 
Erdely said <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administrators was " extremely unhelpful " as sources for her article . 
" I think the administration is concerned about its image , and they were concerned about how the article was going to reflect on them , so instead of being transparent I think they made it far worse for themselves by stonewalling me , " she said . 
In an email to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said the administration was restricted in what information it could provide due to federal and state privacy laws . 
In addition , she said , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> limited its response out of respect for survivors of sexual assault . 
Erdely characterized <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> culture as extremely loyal - loyal " to a detrimental extreme " . 
" These people who had the courage to speak out about aspects of the culture they do n't like are afraid , " she said . 
" They 're afraid of retribution . 
They 're worried about getting backlash from the Greek system and backlash from their peers . " 
She said <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> faced particular hostility . 
" Last year she had a bottle thrown at her , and she 's been chastised by her peers just for getting her story out , " she said . 
" This is in some ways one of the toughest stories I 've done because I 've never known interview subjects to be so afraid of the backlash they would get just for speaking out . " 
Erdely said she hopes the article will promote increased reporting rates and awareness of sexual assault across college campuses in general .
