<PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> said , " The boisterous sea of liberty is never without a wave . " 
The truth of that statement is unquestionable . 
Most controversial issues facing the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> today revolve around the issue of liberty : should a person have the freedom to smoke marijuana , or the freedom to burn a flag ? 
Less controversial , it would seem , is the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment . 
A poll on the street would yield little , if any , opposition to free speech , and yet , small infringements occur all the time . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University of Wisconsin-Madison</ORGANIZATION> faculty speech code is just one example . 
Created 17 years ago , the code was broadened in <DATE>1989</DATE> , going above and beyond the standard sexual harassment codes at many schools . 
These codes prohibit sexually offensive speech . 
Currently , the code does n't include any provisions to protect academic freedom . 
Controversial and potentially offensive lecture materials -- especially anything to do with race or religion -- can leave a professor vulnerable to accusations under the speech code . 
That is no way to run a university . 
We can not learn in an environment where intellectual freedom , and thus , intellectual diversity , is restricted . 
The prohibition of offensive speech that is intended to be malicious is one thing ; professors should not engage in such behavior . 
If there are concerns , however , they should be dealt with from the ground up . 
Universities should take preventative measures in the hiring process . 
At its core , offensiveness breeds conflict , and , like it or not , conflict is a large part of higher education . 
Indeed , an education can not be complete without exposure to conflict . 
How can a student justify a viewpoint until he has been forced to defend it ? 
Even issues like equality ( this includes gender and racial struggles ) , have two sides . 
While political correctness prescribes a set of rights and wrongs , any discussion of freedom of speech must avoid judging either side of a conflict . 
The prerogative to be wrong is inherent in this most basic of freedoms . 
Freedom of speech means that if <PERSON>Joe Blow</PERSON> wants to , he can say that he thinks women are stupid . 
It 's not nice , and it 's certainly not PC , but it 's his right , so long as it is n't slanderous . 
The responsibility to challenge him and make him reconsider his view falls to those who disagree with him . 
This sort of give and take is essential to higher education -- the presentation of challenges , the overcoming of obstacles . 
Above all , professors should not be afraid to speak in the classroom . 
At <ORGANIZATION>the University of Wisconsin</ORGANIZATION> , however , they are afraid . 
The school 's faculty senate will be hearing two alternatives to the current speech code on <DATE>March 1</DATE> . 
The first alternative adds a provision saying that speech is only punishable if it is intended to demean or derogate . 
Intent is not addressed in the current code . 
The second alternative calls for the deletion of the section of the code dealing with academic speech and subject-related discussion . 
This is the only alternative that will work . 
In the 17 years that the <PERSON>Madison</PERSON> speech code has been in place , there have only been a few informal investigations . 
One incident involved a professor 's use of the word " niggardly , " ( which , coincidentally , occurred around the same time as the <PERSON>David Howard</PERSON> debacle in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> ) A student went before the faculty senate to protest her literature professor 's use of the word in a lecture on " The Canterbury Tales . " 
The professor used the word -- which means " stingy " and has no relation to the derogatory term " nigger " -- to describe one of the book 's main characters . 
Even after learning what the word meant , the student used the incident , which she felt was a violation of the speech code , to urge the faculty senate to uphold the strict speech code . 
This incident demonstrates the danger even a well-intended speech code can cause . 
If there is any possibility that a perfectly legitimate word that sounds similar to a more offensive term could be grounds for punishment under the faculty speech code , <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> 's way is clear . 
The code must be severely narrowed , or abolished . 
We must protect freedom of speech at all costs . 
Our education depends on it .
