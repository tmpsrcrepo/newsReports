Orange County resident <PERSON>James Garnett Lloyd</PERSON> pleaded guilty to breaking into the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Delta Zeta</ORGANIZATION> sorority house in <DATE>March</DATE> during <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Circuit Court</ORGANIZATION> proceedings <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> . 
Lloyd also remains under investigation for the sexual assault of a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student under <ORGANIZATION>Beta Bridge</ORGANIZATION> last <DATE>October</DATE> . 
Lloyd pleaded guilty to the charge of entering an occupied dwelling with intent to commit larceny , <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Lt. Chip Harding</ORGANIZATION> said . 
Harding said the crime is a felony and carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison . 
Asst. <ORGANIZATION>City Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> 's Attorney <PERSON>Ron Huber</PERSON> , who is overseeing <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> 's case , said <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> will be sentenced <DATE>March 9</DATE> . 
Lloyd was arrested <DATE>March 14</DATE> after being found inside the sorority house . 
Harding said <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> was found in one of the bedrooms of the house and the door of the Chancellor Street house had been kicked in . 
Lloyd also has been charged with , but has not pleaded guilty to , an <DATE>Oct. 17 , 1998</DATE> break-in at <ORGANIZATION>Delta Zeta</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Huber</PERSON> said <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> will face a preliminary hearing on those charges of breaking and entering <DATE>Dec. 9</DATE> . 
Harding said <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> also is under investigation for the <DATE>Oct. 15 , 1998</DATE> rape of a female <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student under <ORGANIZATION>Beta Bridge</ORGANIZATION> . 
Police have taken DNA samples from <LOCATION>Lloyd</LOCATION> , he said , and should know in a few weeks whether his DNA matches evidence from the crime . 
He added that because <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> is now in police custody , the DNA-matching procedure does not have the highest priority and officials are unsure how quickly they will receive the test results . 
Harding said sometimes police will request that the laboratory test be given priority if a crime is " extremely violent and the suspect is not in custody , " but those conditions do not apply in this case . 
He said police would be " remiss not to ask for DNA samples " in this case , and added that all convicted felons are required to provide a DNA sample under state law . 
He added that <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> is a suspect in the rape case because of three factors -- his history of sexual crimes , his charge for the <DATE>Oct. 17</DATE> break-in which occurred only 25 hours after the rape under the bridge and the proximity of <ORGANIZATION>Delta Zeta</ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION>Beta Bridge</ORGANIZATION> . 
Lloyd has been found guilty of sex crimes on six previous occasions and had spent a total of 84 days in jail for those incidents . 
Lloyd 's attorney , <PERSON>Cheryl Higgins</PERSON> , could not be reached for comment . 
<ORGANIZATION>Delta Zeta President Adele Skaff</ORGANIZATION> could not be reached for comment . 
Asst. Dean of Students <PERSON>Aaron Laushway</PERSON> praised police for investigating the crime thoroughly , but also said students should continue to be conscious of their safety . 
" This should not suggest that students in general can let their guard down , " <PERSON>Laushway</PERSON> said . 
" It can not be understated that our students need to ceaselessly be aware of their environment . "
