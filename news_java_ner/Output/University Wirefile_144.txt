Weeklong protests at the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Military Institute</ORGANIZATION> ended <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> after several meetings between cadet leaders and the institution 's superintendent . 
The conflict arose when senior cadets responsible for running the Ratline , a disciplinary system for new cadets , refused to fulfill their basic training duties in protest of the dismissals of two upperclassmen . 
The Ratline was reinstated <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> . 
The situation was " resolved and there have been no more protests , " said <PERSON>Donna Weaver</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>VMI</ORGANIZATION> 's assistant director of public relations . 
VMI had dismissed two cadets and suspended another <DATE>Sept. 13</DATE> for disciplinary reasons after one freshman cadet claimed he had been singled out for harassment on the Ratline by the upperclassmen . 
The Ratline is a long-standing tradition at <ORGANIZATION>VMI</ORGANIZATION> , which gives seniors the responsibility of training and disciplining freshmen cadets . 
Freshmen on the Ratline are required to walk in straight lines , cut sharp corners , tuck chins in and put arms at their sides . 
They march and drill frequently and answer impromptu questions on the institute 's history and regulations . 
During the protests this freshmen training system was suspended for nearly a week . 
This halted many of the activities at the entire institute . 
" VMI 's Ratline is an essential part of our educational philosophy and properly administered becomes a cherished part of the experiences of every VMI cadet , " said VMI Superintendent Major General <PERSON>Josiah Bunting III</PERSON> in a statement released <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> . 
" When cadets who are responsible for administering this system , however , step over the carefully prescribed lines of conduct that are established for them , our reaction is swift and in some cases , severe . " 
Several VMI alumni have voiced their support for the superintendent 's decision in the matter . 
<PERSON>Richard Trumbo</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>VMI</ORGANIZATION> alumnus and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> resident said he believes the protests are not special to <ORGANIZATION>VMI</ORGANIZATION> , but part of the give and take between faculty and students at all colleges and universities . 
" Disputes between teachers and students go on in schools ; VMI is no different , " <PERSON>Trumbo</PERSON> said . 
" The Ratline is an integral part of the <ORGANIZATION>VMI</ORGANIZATION> experience . " 
Other alumni also have stood by the institution throughout this dispute . 
" I support the opinion of the superintendent , " said <PERSON>M. Edgar Hollowell</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>VMI</ORGANIZATION> alumnus and <LOCATION>Waynesboro</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> resident . 
According to <PERSON>Weaver</PERSON> , suspension of the Ratline is not unusual , but this year 's protest lasted longer than usual -- almost a week . 
VMI has thoroughly reviewed all of the disciplinary action taken within the past week . 
After review , officials decided tostand by their original decision .
