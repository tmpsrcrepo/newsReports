" Hey , bitch , give me your number , " one yelled . 
" I lost my number . 
I think I need yours , " another called . 
I wanted to turn around and give them all the middle finger and tell them why their actions were wrong , why their words hurt not just me , but themselves too . 
But I just stared ahead . 
Experience has taught me not to acknowledge the 20-somethings who perch on the wall across from <LOCATION>Boylan Heights</LOCATION> . 
Experience taught me to put one foot in front of the other during my mid-afternoon walk to my apartment from class . 
Experience and culture enforced the denial and forgetting of catcalls and misogynistic comments . 
When home during <DATE>Christmas</DATE> , my dad told me that I hit the " genetic lottery . " 
I never want for food , a roof or new clothes . 
More importantly , I have been given an educational experience <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of the world would die to have . 
Yet in this moment , walking in the biting cold from a history class , I questioned whether or not being born a girl really means winning the lottery . 
Furthermore , I questioned whether my exceptional education was attempting to reconcile and eliminate the negative effects of being a woman . 
My history class this semester , Women in <LOCATION>South Asia</LOCATION> , has 57 students . 
Of these 57 students , there are only four men enrolled . 
On the first day of class , my professor said , " Look around . 
These men are your allies . 
They did n't need to take this class . " 
The point of this article is not to blame male students who do n't want to take a gender studies class . 
Rather , I wish to examine the academic culture which simultaneously produces the misogyny of students on the <ORGANIZATION>Corner</ORGANIZATION> , and a Women , Gender & Sexuality program which caters almost entirely to female students . 
Gender relations are not a newly debated topic . 
Many have long acknowledged that the world works differently for women and men , and , in many ways , women are objectified by a society that puts significant pressure on them to become both a sex object and a CEO . 
In the past week , while nearly 1,000 girls trudged through sleet and rain to participate in sorority recruitment , fraternity boys sat and threw frozen waffles at them . 
A few nights ago , a random student groped my friend at a bar . 
In the infamous statistic , one in four women will be sexually assaulted while in college . 
To state " women are treated equally here " is to deny the experiences of many women . 
I believe <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has an obligation not only to respond to sexual assault charges in a more punitive manner , but also to create an environment which prevents these assaults from occurring in the first place . 
I acknowledge that our generation is rapidly changing , and <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> itself has become a place which fosters this kind of discussion . 
Just this past week , a fellow Life columnist tackled the use of the word " slut , " showcasing the growing trend of discussion-based approach to the gender gap . 
But even as we see progress , I am not satisfied with my position as a woman here . 
In hearing male friends deny female exploitation , the skewed number of males in leadership positions , the catcalls and frozen waffles thrown to silence and degrade , I feel it necessary to call for reform . 
Ultimately , I wish for an open and fear-free environment for the women of this community . 
I think this can be possible with a requirement in the Women , Gender & Sexuality program , or an equivalent class focusing on women 's issues . 
As important as increased education efforts by peer-groups such as One in Four remain , I feel that there is a lack of understanding and awareness of gender issues in the community that needs to be addressed . 
I call for a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> which promotes individuals , regardless of gender , sexual orientation or religious background . 
This promotion is naturally coupled with a protection of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's students , and punishment taken toward those that infringe upon these rights .
