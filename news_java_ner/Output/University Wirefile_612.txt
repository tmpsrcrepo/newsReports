<PERSON>Mitchell Vaughn</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily The number of participants in <DATE>2015</DATE> formal recruitment for both the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Sorority Council</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> 's <DATE>spring</DATE> rush saw an increase from last year . 
In total , 1,028 men rushed <ORGANIZATION>University IFC</ORGANIZATION> fraternities - a 10-person increase from last year . 
Sororities saw a 62-person increase from <DATE>2014</DATE> , bringing the total rushees for the year to 1,056 - the highest participation in the <ORGANIZATION>ISC</ORGANIZATION> 's history . 
IFC Vice President of Membership <PERSON>Peter Schnuck</PERSON> , a second-year College student , said while the Rolling Stone article released last semester - which , in part , shone a negative light on <ORGANIZATION>University Greek</ORGANIZATION> culture as part of a narrative about an alleged sexual assault - may have affected standards for fraternities , it has not adversely impacted the number of participants . 
" There is definitely more publicity to the Greek system , " <PERSON>Schnuck</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Schnuck</PERSON> said neither the new Fraternal Organization Agreement standards imposed by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , nor the slight increase of participants , have significantly impacted the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> 's <DATE>spring</DATE> rush . 
" Nobody 's having major parties during rush , so it has n't had that much of an impact , " <PERSON>Schnuck</PERSON> said . 
" People are just being more careful . " 
The same seems to be true of sorority rush . 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Julia Pedrick</PERSON> , outgoing <ORGANIZATION>ISC</ORGANIZATION> president , said sororities saw record numbers . 
" For the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Sorority Council</ORGANIZATION> , we had record numbers of potential new members registered for our formal recruitment , with over a thousand women registered , " <PERSON>Pedrick</PERSON> said in an email . 
<PERSON>Pedrick</PERSON> said the increase in rushees reflects the increasing size of the first-year class . 
" As the first year class continues to grow , we expect a corresponding increase in women registered for formal recruitment , " <PERSON>Pedrick</PERSON> said . 
The slight uptick in participants , <PERSON>Pedrick</PERSON> said , had " very little " impact on formal recruitment . 
Both <PERSON>Pedrick</PERSON> and <PERSON>Schnuck</PERSON> said they believe future recruitments will see relatively similar number of participants , regardless of any lasting effects of the Rolling Stone article . 
" I expect the numbers to continue to increase with the increasing first year class , " <PERSON>Pedrick</PERSON> said . 
" If the first year class levels out and stops expanding in the future , I expect that to be reflected in our registered recruitment numbers . "
