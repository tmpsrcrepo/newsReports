With the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> , students , administrators and faculty have all become increasingly worried about the relative safety of our Grounds and of the greater <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> area . 
As reasonable a concern as this is - and as terrifying as <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> 's disappearance has been - some have unfairly placed blame for a perceived unsafe environment on the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
First , it is important to clarify just what our community 's safety concerns are right now . 
Hannah 's case is tragic and has shocked <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> residents and <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students alike . 
But , the fact that it has shocked us should remind us that , in the grand scheme of alleged crime close to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , this disappearance is an anomaly . 
It is natural to wonder how , in the aftermath of a tragedy , we may have prevented the event - but we must approach such a question rationally , and it appears to me that many have allowed their emotional reaction to overwhelm their ability to reason . 
It is immensely frustrating not to know whom to blame , and I have experienced this frustration , too . 
At different intervals , I 've been angry with the very concept of sexual assault , with the administration , with a lack of bystander intervention , and with the possibility of impaired judgment ; but these are speculative judgments on my part , and are not necessarily rational or supported by what little information we have regarding <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> 's case . 
We have yet to determine what the ultimate lesson of her case should be . 
This does not mean we should not take every possible precaution in our everyday lives ; it means we should not rush to judgment about what precaution is most important in light of this case . 
A recent letter to the editor describes a failure on the part of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to anticipate crime , alert students to crime in the greater <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> area , or to provide sufficient safety services beyond <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> property . 
The writer suggests the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should place blue lights around the greater <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> area and take greater responsibility for students ' safety when they are off-Grounds ; anything less than this is " akin to neglect and a very serious violation of this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's promise to keep us safe . " 
This is an entirely unreasonable suggestion . 
The city of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> is responsible for occurrences in its city ; likewise , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is responsible for occurrences on its property and among its students ( i.e. , altercations between <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students that occur off-Grounds ) . 
We do not simply have the authority to place blue lights everywhere , as not all the property in the city belongs to us . 
Charlottesville is an inclusive and small community , so it is natural to believe the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should take on a stronger role in student safety beyond Grounds , but consider , for example , schools in much larger cities , like <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> . 
Is it the responsibility of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University or New York University</ORGANIZATION> to extend their safety systems beyond the expanse of their campuses ? 
Doing so would require extending their systems into the depths of a huge metropolis , with little guarantee that those safety measures will be used exclusively by their own students . 
This makes it immediately clear why such demands are problematic . 
This does not mean the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> does not have a responsibility to educate its students about safety issues - and our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> already does . 
I have been satisfied with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's quick and careful response to <PERSON>Hannah</PERSON> 's case ; we have received several emails from administrators and members of <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> about how to best protect ourselves , as well as general precautionary measures . 
At Orientation and in the days leading up to the start of school , first-years learn from resident advisors and other authoritative persons about the dangers of impaired judgment , helpful systems such as Safe Ride ( whose capacity was increased in the immediate aftermath of Hannah 's disappearance ) , and what resources the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has to offer to students who may feel unsafe . 
The most the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> can do in addition to providing these resources is encourage responsible behavior , for ourselves and for each other . 
Regardless of new tragedies , we should constantly be re-examining and revising the extent and scope of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's safety policies , something this tragedy has forced us to do . 
But upon re-examination , we can not leap to the judgment that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has failed us , because it has not . 
We can look for new ways in which the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> can serve us - but at the end of the day , we can not hold it accountable for crimes or issues beyond its physical and legal borders .
