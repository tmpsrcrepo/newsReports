<PERSON>Porter Dickie</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily University</ORGANIZATION> alumni from across the country have reacted to the article published in Rolling Stone <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> , which detailed an alleged case of gang rape at a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> fraternity party . 
Several alumni have started and signed petitions calling for reform of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's handling of sexual violence cases . 
The recently released Rolling Stone article portraying a graphic gang rape of a then-first-year student by seven men at a fraternity party has produced a wave of reactions among the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's alumni . 
Many have been motivated to take action and demand the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administration - portrayed in the article as failing to address survivors ' needs or pursue justice against perpetrators of sexual violence - immediately do the same . 
<PERSON>Robert Viccellio</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>Alumni Association</ORGANIZATION> vice president of communications , said many alumni are taken aback by the article . 
" Alumni are expressing anger , as well as deep concern for the survivors of sexual assaults and for the overall safety of students on Grounds , " he said . 
In response to the article , the <ORGANIZATION>Alumni Association</ORGANIZATION> established an online portal <DATE>Friday</DATE> for alumni to express their concerns and give their feedback on the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's handling of sexual assault cases . 
In an email , <ORGANIZATION>Alumni Association President Tom Faulders</ORGANIZATION> also encouraged alumni to post in the Alumni Forum to start a dialogue about how to address the issue . 
" We will take your comments and ensure that they are delivered to the right people here at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Faulders</PERSON> said in the email . 
" We realize that this is a difficult and painful subject , but we also know that through your ideas and debate , a stronger <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will emerge . " 
Dean <PERSON>T. Janis</PERSON> , alumnus of the <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> and Law Schools , cited the disturbing fact that no student has ever been expelled from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> for sexual assault as one of his greatest points of discontent . 
" This is staggering , " he said . 
" This can not solely be the result of the underreporting of sexual assaults . 
This can only be the result of a system designed to discourage reporting , to gloss over reported incidents and to emasculate any system having the purported authority to punish student violations . " 
A <DATE>2013</DATE> alum of the <ORGANIZATION>Engineering School</ORGANIZATION> , who wanted to remain anonymous , said , " The first thing to come across my mind was disgust . 
... The graphic account of the incident left me feeling literally sick to my stomach . " 
According to this alumnus , " The consensus among friends is that this is not the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> we do recently remember . " 
Through petitions to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and contact with the <ORGANIZATION>Alumni Association</ORGANIZATION> , many have proposed specific courses of action to be taken in response to the article . 
<PERSON>Viccellio</PERSON> said demands have included , " a complete investigation of the events described in the Rolling Stone article " and " real and immediate change in the way that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> prevents and responds to rape and sexual misconduct . " 
Above all , alumni have requested a " thorough review of the fraternity system " and to be kept involved in the discussion of the issue and its potential solutions , <PERSON>Viccellio</PERSON> said . 
Two alumni - <PERSON>Carey Albertine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Saira Rao</PERSON> - have called for the abolition of the Greek system at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> entirely through a change.org petition which has garnered nearly 400 signatures as of <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> . 
" As alumni of U.Va . 
- and of the Greek system - we can attest to the insidious culture bred therein , " they write . 
" We can attest to the racism , classism and sexism contingent to this system 's success . " 
<PERSON>Lisa Richey</PERSON> , a <DATE>2003</DATE> University alumna and <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> resident , launched the " UVrApe Alumni Victims Defense Fund " in response to the article , which has already raised more than <MONEY>$ 15,000</MONEY> . " 
[ We want ] to raise as much money as possible from as many donors as possible in order to fund an outside counsel who will be available to victims of sexual assault , " she said . 
This will provide confidentiality and qualified counsel to victims of sexual assault , giving them the confidence to take the " enormous leap of making this terribly private thing into a [ court ] case , " <PERSON>Richey</PERSON> said . 
Among donors to her foundation , she said " the most common reactions are outrage at the details of the crimes , overwhelming disappointment at the actions ( or inactions ) of the administrators and embarrassment at being depicted as a student body that would rather keep the party going strong than stand up for victims . " 
The story told in the article has caused many alumni to question the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> culture more broadly . 
" As a fraternity man at <LOCATION>U.Va.</LOCATION> , it was shocking and horrific that people in any sort of organization at U.Va . 
could ... condone or not actively fight against gang rape , " the Engineering alumnus said . 
He said though many readers are skeptical due to the article 's level of sensationalism , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administration and Greek life have been publicly implicated in such a negative manner that the article can be nothing but bad for both parties . 
Ultimately , <PERSON>Richey</PERSON> said , alumni are calling for clear and decisive action . 
" It 's not a new problem , and it 's not a U.Va . 
problem - it 's a college problem , " she said . 
" However , <LOCATION>U.Va</LOCATION> . 
has never considered herself average , and I can not see anyone accepting the idea that this is a problem on most college campuses as an excuse to do nothing . 
Until victims are getting all the support and representation they need , until administrators are honest about what they are able to do and where they know they will fall short - for example , admitting to victims how unlikely it is that prosecution will lead to expulsion - I do n't think anyone can say we as a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> are doing enough . " 
<PERSON>Richey</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> needs to give survivors access to qualified professional counseling , if they desire it , and allow state authorities to play a more significant role in sexual assault investigation . 
" We can not stop all rape , but we absolutely can support all rape victims , " she said . 
On the other end , many alumni want to see harsher punishments for offenders . 
" People can not let rape or assault go unpunished , " the Engineering alumnus said . 
" Immediate expulsion should exist as an appropriate punishment . "
