The Parents ' Program of <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia Alumni Association</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Thursday</DATE> it is donating an additional <MONEY>$ 30,000</MONEY> to the existing <MONEY>$ 20,000</MONEY> to any person who can provide information leading to the apprehension and conviction of the serial rapist . 
A concerned parent anonymously donated an additional <MONEY>$ 5,000</MONEY> , boosting the total reward to <MONEY>$ 55,000</MONEY> , which more than doubled the previous amount . 
The serial rapist is responsible for seven reported incidents of sexual assault over the past eight years , some of which affected <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students . 
" The Parents ' Program has long been very interested in student safety and security , and when they met last week , the issue of the serial rapist was brought up by some of the parents , and they felt a need or a desire to make a contribution that might help in the apprehension of the serial rapist , " University spokesperson <PERSON>Carol Wood</PERSON> said . 
According to Parents ' Program Co-Chair <PERSON>Jeff Hillebrand</PERSON> , the group meets twice a year to allocate funds donated by non-alumni parents to student programs and handle proposals from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's administration and academic deans . 
One of the members suggested contributing money towards the capture of the rapist in a meeting held over Parents ' <DATE>Weekend</DATE> . 
" This was not in response to a specific proposal but more to the overall safety [ of ] students on and off Grounds , " <PERSON>Hillebrand</PERSON> said . 
Since the Parents ' Program was founded in <DATE>1980</DATE> , student safety has been one of its primary focuses , <PERSON>Hillebrand</PERSON> said . 
" This was in that spirit , " he said . 
" We know this is a predator that has been in the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> area for sometime , and we are hoping through our small efforts we can bring this person to justice . " 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Michael Gibson</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police</ORGANIZATION> detectives are following a number of leads and are hopeful that the increase in the reward will bring someone forward who may have information pertaining to the case . 
" We are convinced there is somebody who has information that has yet to step forward , " <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> said . 
<LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Police Lt. <PERSON>J.W. Gibson</PERSON> said the suspect came into the victims ' homes through unlocked doors and windows . 
He said he encourages students to lock their doors to prevent strangers from entering and to contact the police if they see any unfamiliar persons in their homes . 
According to <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> , many peeping toms incidents go unreported . 
" This person is out stalking and hunting for a victim , and that hunting takes the form of peeping , " he said . 
" That 's how they choose their target , so it 's important for people to report that sort of activity . " 
<PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> said he wishes to correct the misconception that this case only pertains to females . 
" This person is out looking at windows , so he does n't know who he 's going to see , " he said . 
He emphasized that anyone , male or female , who witnesses suspicious activity should report it to the police immediately . 
" We all have a mutual responsibility to one another to make it a safe community and do what we can , " <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> said .
