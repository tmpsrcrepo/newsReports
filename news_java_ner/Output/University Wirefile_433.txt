<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily Yesterday afternoon , the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Leadership Council</ORGANIZATION> hosted a summit to congregate student leaders and a " small representation of community stakeholders " to discuss sexual assault prevention at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and how peer educators could address the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student body more broadly . 
Organizations represented included the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> , One in Four , One Less , the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Sorority Council</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> , the Women 's Center , <ORGANIZATION>Black Student Alliance</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> , among others . 
According to <PERSON>Sara Surface</PERSON> , a third-year College student and external chair of the SALC , said the summit was " especially important in order to discuss how language is used to expand the communication of sexual misconduct between other organizations and most importantly other students . " 
To effectively prevent sexual misconduct and educate students about the issue , the attendees of the summit agreed that it is vital to get students openly talking about the role sexual misconduct plays in <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> culture in addition to expanding student training in bystander intervention . 
Surface said that it was important that students organizations start addressing the issue head on , citing the potential of the newly launched " Hoos Got Your Back " campaign , which is designed to get students " excited about [ preventing sexual misconduct ] and acknowledge their commitment and responsibility to this issue . " 
Some representatives expressed that they saw the majority of conversation on Grounds surrounding sexual misconduct and bystander prevention as concentrated in the Greek community . 
The summit sought to find ways to increase the accessibility of resources about sexual misconduct for students who are not in fraternities or sororities , or in various advocacy organizations . 
" I think that it will be important to create a conversation about this between the <ORGANIZATION>CIO</ORGANIZATION> 's and the minority-run student organizations around Grounds , " said <PERSON>Shanice Hardy</PERSON> , a fourth-year <PERSON>Batten</PERSON> student and vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Black Student Alliance</ORGANIZATION> . 
" A lot of the times the presentations that are shown to [ the fraternities and sororities of the <ORGANIZATION>National Panhellenic Council</ORGANIZATION> ] are n't tailored to how black students are affected by sexual misconduct . " 
The general consensus was that specific groups throughout Grounds , such as One in Four and One Less - which respectively are the all-male and all-female sexual assault and peer education groups - have large presences within certain organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>ISC</ORGANIZATION> , but that they need to better impact the entire student body . 
SALC representatives highlighted that the student-run organizations need to construct a central body that increases communication between all groups and bridges the gap between their goals . 
" One of our huge initiative this year is to build outreach to all student groups , to make sure we 're not hitting the same old groups , " Surface said . 
" Of course sororities and fraternities have a big stake in this issue , but so do many other CIO 's around Grounds and we need to start a conversation to work together . " 
A majority of the advocacy-group representatives agreed that although the formal presentations some organizations use to communicate with students are effective in accumulating awareness , making the presentations informal would allow for attendees to voice their opinion and create dialogue . 
Partnership with administration was also viewed positively and several participants praised <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> 's recent email that was distributed to all students and faculty calling for new sexual misconduct policies . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> introduced the " Not On Our Grounds " campaign in the email , which encourages zero tolerance for sexual violence and assault and has gained popularity through social media and has been included in first-year discussions during " Welcome Week . " 
Some of the conversation focused on how the phrase " community of trust " could be utilized in relation to prevention of sexual assault . 
However , some student leaders showed reservations about the use of the phrase due to its association with the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> and Honor offenses rather than explicitly noting opposition to sexual misconduct . 
There was also discussion of how " community of trust " could imply exclusion rather than inclusion of representatives of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> because the phrase was historically used in the context of whiteness and straightness at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , which they said could have the unintended consequence of alienating sexual and racial minorities .
