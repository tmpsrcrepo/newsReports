The <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> has met the nearly all of the recommendations for campus safety and security recently proposed by Virginia21 , an " action-tank " , or political advocate , for young people , said dean of students <ORGANIZATION>Penny Rue</ORGANIZATION> . 
Virginia21 announced its newest plan to increase safety and security on college campuses state-wide <DATE>Thursday</DATE> with the three-part " Protect Virginia Students " proposal . 
Virginia21 has three main goals : strengthen campus police , increase the accountability of universities and give power to college communities to solve problems on their own , according to Virginia21 spokesperson <PERSON>David Solimini</PERSON> . 
The " Protect <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Students " plan , which comes after an extensive two-year study of campus crime by the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Crime Commission</ORGANIZATION> , will create a " college law-enforcement center to set standards and guidelines for campus police across the state , " <PERSON>Solimini</PERSON> said . 
The Center will also create a centralized data collection network to be implemented by all state universities , he said . 
Currently , <ORGANIZATION>the State Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> evaluates <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> colleges and universities annually in areas including affordability , diversity and availability of financial aid . 
Part of the Virginia21 plan is to increase the accountability of colleges by requiring campus safety and security to be added to the scorecard to measure progress toward lowering crime , <PERSON>Solimini</PERSON> said . 
When state universities meet their requirements and make progress in areas of safety and security , they receive competitive state-funded grants , he said . 
According to <LOCATION>Solimini</LOCATION> , universities will be free to use these competitive grants toward campus security in any way they see fit . 
" Schools are getting increased freedom with the grants , " <PERSON>Solimini</PERSON> explained . 
" For example , police and college administrators can apply for grants to run education programs to decrease sexual assaults , or college police can buy radios to communicate with local police . " 
According to a Virginia21 press release , several state universities do not have written policy and procedure manuals or a centralized database to track case information . 
However , the U.Va has already implemented many of the reforms , <ORGANIZATION>Rue</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" U.Va . 
has a fully commissioned police force that has a good working relationship with the city and county police , " <PERSON>Rue</PERSON> said . 
" We were able to serve as a model for the plan , which is what you would expect from a flagship institution . " 
According to the Virginia21 press release , the proposal also calls for better standards for hiring and training . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> sergeant <ORGANIZATION>Melissa Fielding</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> agents already undergo rigorous training in preparation for their jobs . 
" Our officers undergo 14-week police training academy , " she said . 
" Then they have 11 weeks of field training . " 
Although <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> already follows most of the recommendations from the <ORGANIZATION>Crime Commission</ORGANIZATION> , there are some recommendations the <ORGANIZATION>University Police Department</ORGANIZATION> has tried but found to be ineffective , such as the lack of student participation in Safe Ride , <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Captain <PERSON>Michael Coleman</PERSON> said . 
According to the Virginia21 press release , only a handful of collegiate police departments are accredited by an appropriate accrediting agency . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University Police Department</ORGANIZATION> is currently working toward accreditation , according to Fielding .
