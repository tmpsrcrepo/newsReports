To get an idea of what " Wild Things " is about , and to understand the deep intellectual stimulation it provides , imagine an installment of " The <PERSON>Jerry Springer</PERSON> Show " entitled " Students Who Falsely Accuse Their Guidance Counselor of Rape . " 
But the plot also includes theft , fraud , perjury , extortion , suicide , homicide , sexual experimentation and drug and alcohol abuse . 
This film certainly is " Too Hot for TV . " 
A sexually transmitted disease of a movie , " Wild Things " offers characters who take part in every conceivable form of mischief . 
They are trashy , raunchy and downright skanky . 
Personal taste will determine whether audiences find these qualities entertaining , but judging from the reactions of the audience at the screening attended by this critic , the film entertains on a level similar with current daytime ratings-leader <PERSON>Springer</PERSON> . 
You may like it , but it also may give you that self-loathing feeling . 
In a high school in the posh <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION>Blue Bay</LOCATION> , we meet the principal players : way-too-cool guidance counselor <PERSON>Sam Lombardo</PERSON> ( <PERSON>Matt Dillon</PERSON> ) ; hormone-infested rich girl <PERSON>Kelly Van Ryan</PERSON> ( <PERSON>Denise Richards</PERSON> ) ; attitude-infested poor girl <PERSON>Suzie Toller</PERSON> ( <PERSON>Neve Campbell</PERSON> ) ; and a cop ( <PERSON>Kevin Bacon</PERSON> ) . 
Kelly flirts shamelessly with <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> and shares a rivalry with <PERSON>Suzie</PERSON> . 
After washing <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> 's car one afternoon -- and intentionally starting a private wet T-shirt contest -- she leaves his house disheveled and sullen . 
At home , the teary <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> informs her equally sex-crazed mother ( <PERSON>Theresa Russell</PERSON> ) that she misses her father . 
Mom replies with one of many lines in the film that scarcely can be believed : " He did n't have to kill himself , <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> . " 
Kelly eventually accuses <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> of rape , and <PERSON>Suzie</PERSON> soon does the same . 
But their accusations clearly hold little validity . 
Once the apparent truth gets out with the help of <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> 's sleazy defense lawyer ( <PERSON>Bill Murray</PERSON> , searching for and failing to locate his comeback role ) , the film proceeds to explain why they lied . 
It turns out they are not what they seem , and when they seem to be something else , they 're not that either . 
They double - , triple - and quadruple-cross each other in what seems to be a contest to see how many plot twists can be squeezed into 109 minutes . 
As the characters ' motives and allegiances continually shift , they do things that serve purely to increase the movie 's shock value , such as participating in a menage a trois . 
The no-nudity clause in <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION> 's contract leaves director <PERSON>McNaughton</PERSON> unsure of how to use her , though , particularly since <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> has no objections to baring herself . 
But nude or clothed , the sex possesses no emotional content and serves only to add to the trashy feel of the picture . 
<PERSON>McNaughton</PERSON> has done well in the past -- he directed several episodes of " Homicide , " television 's most cerebral , gritty drama -- but here he moves into " Melrose Place " territory . 
McNaughton utterly fails at subtlety . 
His occasional cut-away shots of alligators and lizards are supposed to underscore the " wild " nature of the movie 's characters , but such trite imagery only highlights <PERSON>McNaughton</PERSON> 's deficiencies as a director . 
<PERSON>Campbell</PERSON> , who made a convincing frightened , girl-next-door in the " Scream " films , acts like she belongs in a made-for-TV movie . 
Bacon wanders through the film looking utterly confused , but his role could do that to anyone . 
<PERSON>Dillon</PERSON> 's performance actually is almost decent ; he does not overdo his acting , making his character slightly less ridiculous than the rest . 
As for <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> , she should be admired -- not for her acting , but for knowing her limits . 
She mercilessly exploits her body , hoping to find her path to stardom with such tactics . 
And if you 're into the artificial , gravity-defying look , she 's perfect . 
Like <PERSON>Richards</PERSON> , the filmmakers deserve admiration for aiming so low . 
Their proudest moment is a slap-and-scratch girl brawl that ends when the participants literally kiss and make up . 
The filmmakers seem to have been inspired by a memorable episode of " Seinfeld , " in which <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> explains that men are intrigued by " cat fights " because they " think if two women are grabbing and clawing at each other , there 's a chance they might , somehow , kiss . " 
This idea embodies the theme of " Wild Things " : A movie made for people who want to see on film the scene that <ORGANIZATION>Seinfeld</ORGANIZATION> describes .
