<LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> , and <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> police have been coordinating efforts to capture the area 's serial rapist for months , and are saying they believe <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students are not as aware of the situation as they should be . 
The series of rapes began in <DATE>1997</DATE> in a <LOCATION>Waynesboro</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> , hotel . 
There since have been five assaults connected to the one in <LOCATION>Waynesboro</LOCATION> . 
Genetics and other forensics have been used to trace the series of rapes back to <DATE>1997</DATE> . 
Police said there may have been other connected rapes before <DATE>1997</DATE> , but the police are unaware of them . 
The first rape on Grounds occurred in <DATE>1999</DATE> , followed by another the following year in <LOCATION>Lambeth Field</LOCATION> . 
The victim was able to defend herself , though the rapist left genetic material behind . 
Police stress the fact that the serial rapist does not force his way into homes . 
Most incidents , however , occurred in the home . 
The rapist has been reported to use hidden keys or open windows . 
One of the most dangerous places mentioned by the police is the often-used 15th Street path . 
" It 's a good place to lurk , " <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Paul Norris</PERSON> said . 
The police briefed new students and their parents on the situation at the beginning of the year . 
They also put up pictures of the rapist around Grounds . 
Police said they are dumbfounded by the consistently unsafe practices of students . 
" You still see young ladies out jogging , et cetera , " <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Police Sgt. <PERSON>Richard Hudson</PERSON> said . 
" Students must be more aware . " 
There are some details that are not and will not be available to the public . 
" The suspect is receiving information the same way as everyone else , " <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON>Tim Longo</PERSON> said . 
Police urge the community to cooperate with the investigations . 
" We have the right to stop someone if we have probable cause , " <PERSON>Hudson</PERSON> said . 
" We are trying to eliminate people and the only way to do that is with genetic testing . " 
Certain situations make questioning and stopping more likely . 
" If a person is lurking and looking in windows , then we arrest them , " <PERSON>Hudson</PERSON> said . 
" If we receive a call about suspicious actions , we contact the suspect and obtain genetic material , but if you have a legitimate excuse , everything is fine . " 
Police are aware of the sensitivity caused by a vague description of the rapist . 
" Students are reluctant to call because they do n't want to be racist , " <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> said . 
" They are afraid to call 911 . " 
Police reinforced the need for students to aid in the capture of the rapist . 
" Volunteering information is anonymous , but if you want the reward , you might want to leave your information , " <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON>Melissa Fielding</PERSON> said , referring to the <MONEY>$ 20,000 dollar</MONEY> reward for information leading to the rapist 's capture . 
The police are eager to remove the rapist from the public . 
" We are going to take him off the streets in a manner that is consistent with the law , " <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> said . 
University and <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> police meet once every week to discuss new efforts and new information that may aid in the confinement of the serial rapist .
