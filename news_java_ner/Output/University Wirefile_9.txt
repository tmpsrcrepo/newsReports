I DECIDED to come to this university because it had an excellent academic reputation , the students were far more friendly and helpful here than at any other university I visited and I felt it was far enough away from home without being too far . 
When I joyfully informed friends and relatives about my decision to attend the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> , the first thing that popped out of their mouths almost across the board was , " Hey ! 
Party school ! " 
I have to admit this made me very nervous . 
Luckily , I had the good fortune to live with a suite of women who were happier to stay up until 3:00 on a <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> watching the Muppet movies with a big bowl of popcorn , rather than dancing the night into oblivion out on Rugby Road with a big Solo cup of Natural Light . 
I never felt excluded or pressured into doing anything I did n't want to do , I always felt like there was an alternative to the party scene . 
Unfortunately , though I always have considered myself lucky , the recent discussion about the problems with alcohol on Grounds -- in this newspaper , by President <PERSON>John T. Casteen III</PERSON> , in forums around Grounds -- has forced me to think my experience was an exception to a very frightening rule . 
The more complaints I see about there being " nothing to do " here in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> besides go to parties and drink , the more I wonder if this is the same <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> that I live in . 
And the more reports I read about students losing their lives to alcohol , the angrier I become . 
It should n't have to be this way . 
I wo n't say I never have taken part in the revelry . 
Drinking when everyone else is drinking can seem like fun -- everyone has a great sense of humor , is brilliant , handsome and can dance like <PERSON>John Travolta</PERSON> . 
Being a sober person on these premises , on the other hand , is terrible . 
First of all , there are drunk people everywhere . 
They 're elbowing you , spilling beer on your jeans and grabbing sensitive areas of your body . 
They all seem to think they are extremely funny and can dance like <PERSON>John Revol</PERSON> -- er , <PERSON>Travolta</PERSON> . 
Not to be a stick in the mud , but I really ca n't understand why " partying " like this is a whole lot of fun . 
Perhaps I just have n't developed a collegiate aesthetic appreciation for the perfumes of stale beer and vomit . 
Perhaps being under 21 , I fear the law too much . 
Perhaps I do n't like to worry about who my friends are going home with . 
You see , being a bit of a pessimist , I ca n't help but think of student alcohol use as a huge demon with evil intent . 
We already have heard about several alcohol-related deaths of college students this semester , the most recent occurring just <DATE>last weekend</DATE> , and frightfully close to home , at <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> . 
We had an incident here just a few weeks ago with an intoxicated student from another university assaulting a woman in her own bed . 
How many alcohol-related sexual assaults go unreported we may never know . 
These serious incidents are more than enough to make me think twice about excessive drinking , I do n't know about anyone else . 
Of course , I am also a privileged member of this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> social scene : I have a car , and my schedule permits me to have a part-time job so that I can finance off-Grounds activities . 
I still live with my first-year roommates , most of whom feel Rugby Road is more like a Highway to Hell than an Avenue of Delight . 
In my opinion , I have only a few years here at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and I should take in as much of this great little town as I possibly can ; whereas I pretty much can drink anywhere in the world ( except the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , for another six months or so ) . 
I think it is up to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to try a little harder to find healthy alternatives to Rugby Road that work for the student body . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Union</ORGANIZATION> usually does a good job -- <PERSON>Tom Deluca</PERSON> is an extremely successful event , as are the <ORGANIZATION>Newcomb Hall</ORGANIZATION> movies . 
Some other <LOCATION>Union</LOCATION> activities -- like comedians and coffeehouses -- really need to have more publicity and performance spaces with larger accommodations for more students . 
Evening sports events always are immensely popular . 
Some student organizations host activities that are widely attended as well . 
Considering the popularity of dance short courses here at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , it might be worthwhile for groups to look into hosting more events where prep step , ballroom , shag , etc. , can be danced . 
More free , largely publicized events , like <PERSON>Tom Deluca</PERSON> are worth investigating . 
Maybe something like the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> community 's Fridays After Five -- a series of <DATE>summer</DATE> concerts which draw huge crowds -- could be created here . 
Easier access to the Downtown Mall ( publicize the Hoo Bus ! 
It 's always empty and the Downtown Mall is so cool ! ) 
, or shuttles to places like movie theaters , <PERSON>Kegler</PERSON> 's , and <ORGANIZATION>Fashion Square Mall</ORGANIZATION> would be helpful . 
There should be some action by the students , of course , as well . 
Read the C-Ville Weekly . 
Organize a carpool to Toys R Us , get a video club membership ( <ORGANIZATION>Hollywood Video</ORGANIZATION> is cheap and you can get there on the blue bus line ) or check out <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON> ' selection , go ice skating , try <PERSON>Teppan Yaki</PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION>Chiang House</ORGANIZATION> , go swimming at the <ORGANIZATION>Aquatic & Fitness Center</ORGANIZATION> . 
Experience life . 
Experience <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> . 
Party sometimes , but be responsible about it . 
Know your limits . 
Of course , drinking is going to occur in tandem with many of these suggested activities , especially at first . 
Maybe if the focus slowly could be removed from the tailgate before and the party afterward , and put onto the actual event itself , students would feel they had more choices . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is far more than a " party school " .
