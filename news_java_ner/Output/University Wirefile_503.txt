Tariq placed the responsibility in the hands of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students , encouraging attendees to take action to eliminate rape culture . 
" We need to demand more from ourselves as students as well , " <PERSON>Tariq</PERSON> said . 
" We need to promote an environment where sexual assault and rape is not permitted under any circumstance . 
We need to set the precedent . " 
Other speakers asked fraternities to take a stand against sexual assault . 
Across the board , speakers emphasized that fraternities are not the cause of rape culture , though rapes often occur in fraternity houses . 
English Prof. <PERSON>Jahan Ramazani</PERSON> said the fraternities " do many good honorable things , but have also been involved for too long in making a safe space for criminal violent acts that we all need to decry and denounce and say we 're not going to stand for any more . " 
Tariq said the community needs cooperation from fraternities , and that the rally was not intended to attack them . " 
[ B ] ut we do expect and we do demand that these fraternities evaluate what is going on in their organizations , because these sexual assaults are happening , " <PERSON>Tariq</PERSON> said . 
" We need for these fraternities to establish corrective measures so that they can eliminate these problems so they can get back to doing what they do : providing a brotherhood and a home away from home at this university . " 
Second-year College student <PERSON>Ayaan Alam</PERSON> , a member of MEISA , encouraged students to review the amended sexual misconduct policy recently released by <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Read it , get familiar with it , know what it says , " <PERSON>Alam</PERSON> said . 
" When you read it , read it thoroughly enough to see that if there 's anything you do n't like , let people know about that issue so that your voice is heard . " 
Not all students took an organizing approach . 
Early <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> , it became evident that a group of students responded violently overnight , vandalizing the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity house . 
" A number of windows had been broken with bottles and chunks of cinder block and a portion of the [ <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> house ] had been spray painted , " a press release from police said . 
" Police officers collected evidence from the scene and the incident is under investigation . "

The letter was signed by " The students who vandalized the Phi <ORGANIZATION>Psi</ORGANIZATION> house " and came from <ORGANIZATION>strawberryqueen1717@gmail.com University</ORGANIZATION> faculty and staff have also spoken out in anger and disgust . 
Faculty members of the <ORGANIZATION>Batten School</ORGANIZATION> and various departments of the <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> issued a letter of dissent addressed to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> . 
The statement suggests the immediate suspension of all CIOs under investigation for sexual assault or violence . 
In addition , the letter asks that all Greek-affiliated activities and events scheduled for this weekend be postponed in solidarity with victims of sexual misconduct . 
" We believe this immediate action will be an important first step in sending the message that violence against our students will not be tolerated , " the letter read . 
" It will also send a clear message to fraternities , that if they stand by and fail to intervene in violence , or if they knowingly do not report violence , the activities of your fraternity will be suspended . " 
At the rally , English Prof. <PERSON>Caroline Rody</PERSON> said the prevalence of rape culture at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has offended faculty members across the board . 
" The faculty is employed to teach the values of civilization - that 's what we believe in , that 's what we 're here for , that 's what <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> had in mind , " <PERSON>Rody</PERSON> said . 
" But there has been among us for too long a type of barbarism . 
It sickens us , and we do n't want to remain silent anymore . " 
At the rally , <ORGANIZATION>Tariq</ORGANIZATION> said to prioritize individual members of the student body over the reputation of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , and emphasized that demanding a safe environment does not mean abandoning the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We love this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Tariq</PERSON> said . 
" Here at U.Va. , we bleed orange and blue . 
The pride , the honor , the reputation , the tradition of this university is ingrained in our blood and in our hearts . 
But that being said , the reputation of this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> does not trump the safety of our student body or the student body in general . "
