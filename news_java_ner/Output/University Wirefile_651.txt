A student 's time in college can be at once the best and worst years of his life . 
While students experience newfound freedom , friendships and a multitude of unique experiences found only on college campuses , they also become vulnerable to the hidden dangers that lurk beneath the excitement . 
Loneliness arises as old high school friends fade from the social scene , and stressful schoolwork puts a tremendous burden on students who are used to being at the top of their class . 
Job searches and decisions such as which major to pick have consequences that will echo throughout students ' lives and are additional sources of worry at a time when students may not have family or close friends for comfort . 
Mental illnesses such as depression find fertile ground amid these conditions , when students are alone and susceptible to their dangers . 
While sexual assault has recently been grabbing the headlines on college campuses as one of the greatest dangers facing students , mental illnesses such as depression especially have been quietly causing untold harm to student populations . 
The latest survey by the <ORGANIZATION>Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors</ORGANIZATION> found that <PERCENT>36.4 percent</PERCENT> of college students suffer from some form of depression . 
This is a dangerously high number considering the risks associated with depression , which can include substance abuse , binge drinking and harm to academic performance . 
Students suffering from depression also experience higher rates of suicide and drop out of college in higher numbers - and these side effects do not even include the debilitating illness itself , the effects of which can be anything from feelings of hopelessness and sadness to difficulty concentrating and thoughts of or attempts at suicide . 
As can be seen from the wide range of symptoms listed , depression is a complex illness that goes far beyond feelings of sadness , which many fail to understand . 
This lack of understanding , coupled with the often subtle effects of depression , can cause students to mistake their mood changes and other symptoms as nothing more than unavoidable results of the stress of college , a misunderstanding which prevents the affected students from getting the help they need . 
Though a certain amount of stress and sadness are normal , students must be made aware of what separates normal amounts of sadness and anxiety from harmful levels that are the result of a mental illness . 
At the very least , students should always have the opportunity to address their worries to a trained professional who can either lay those fears to rest or set them on a path to healing . 
Not enough has been done here at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to protect students from depression and mental illnesses like it . 
The administration needs to take concrete steps to increase both students ' awareness of the symptoms of depression and their access to treatment for it . 
This is not to suggest that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has been lax , however . 
The Mental Wellness Screening Day that took place on <DATE>Feb. 19</DATE> in <ORGANIZATION>Newcomb</ORGANIZATION> is a great example of steps the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should be taking to make students aware of both the presence of mental illnesses on Grounds and the availability of Counseling and <ORGANIZATION>Psychological Services</ORGANIZATION> for troubled students . 
Such events provide a convenient outlet for students who do not feel their problems are serious enough to merit a call to CAPS , but still feel the need to talk to someone . 
This idea can be taken further . 
Instead of one <ORGANIZATION>Mental Wellness Screening Day</ORGANIZATION> , a recurring event similar to it should be established in a public and stress-free environment that is convenient for students . 
On a related note , CAPS could open an auxiliary office somewhere near first-year dorms . 
As first years may be the most vulnerable to depression and have the least information on the resources the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> provides for help , mental health screening and care options need to be made more readily available for their use . 
The past semester has been a tragic one for this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> as several fellow students committed suicide . 
Increasing awareness and treatment options for mental health on campus is a step toward both healing the scars left by these tragedies and preventing new ones from arising . 
Students of all years , religions and demographics may experience the pain of a mental illness and need to be made aware of and given access to the resources necessary for healing .
