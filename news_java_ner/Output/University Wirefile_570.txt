blockquote { float : right ; color : gray ; } Students responded in force to reports <DATE>Friday</DATE> which alleged that some claims in last month 's Rolling Stone article , detailing a gang rape at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>2012</DATE> , may be false . 
A statement by <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity outlined an internal investigation which found a number of the details presented in the article are possibly untrue . 
Many <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students have expressed anger and frustration with the magazine 's handling of the case , confused about the alleged crime and how to respond to its negative portrayal of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Second-year College student <PERSON>Erin O'Reilly</PERSON> said the emotional nature of the article itself should have warranted a more thorough investigation from the beginning . 
" This brought up a lot of emotions for a lot of people here , " she said . 
" To think that [ Erdely ] did n't do her due diligence , it 's very upsetting . 
When the article came out it was inflammatory . 
... I had thought that Rolling Stone was reliable and would back this up . 
But now , for it to be that there are some things that were n't accurate , I do n't know what to think . " 
Many still said the original article is valuable for the attention it has drawn - both at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and nationally - to sexual assault on Grounds and other college campuses . 
Second-year College student <ORGANIZATION>Grant Schwab</ORGANIZATION> said the value of article is not lost by its possible inaccuracies , and the only thing the student body should be focusing on is how the article has brought the issue of sexual assault into the spotlight . 
" I think it 's still important , I think we still need to value it for giving life to an issue that not only exists here , at U.Va. , but also around the country , and I think that 's all we should think about . 
Period , " <PERSON>Schwab</PERSON> said . 
" You can say what you want about the article from Rolling Stone , how it 's bad journalism or it does n't do its purpose ; it still does n't matter as the article is still important . " 
Second-year College student <PERSON>Ben Lowery</PERSON> said he thought it was Rolling Stone 's goal all along to bring attention to sexual assault . 
" I think it 's good that there 's now national spotlight on this issue of sexual assault , " <PERSON>Lowery</PERSON> said . 
" I think that was Rolling Stone 's goal all along and they just needed a dramatic story to get attention on it . 
It 's unfortunate that it had to be U.Va. , but I think they accomplished their goal . " 
<PERSON>Lowery</PERSON> said the article has been beneficial in affording the community the ability to discuss this issue in new and broader settings . 
" Most of the professors and TAs were open to talk about it and allowed for conversation if anyone wanted it , " he said . 
" I think a lot of people were obviously pretty shocked but I think we did a good job of coming together in response to it . " 
Others were angry about the manner in which the Rolling Stone approached the story , especially its portrayal of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> . 
<PERSON>Monika Zinn</PERSON> , a second-year in the College , said the magazine was working in their own self-interest and in doing so took advantage of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's circumstances . 
" I think the journalist 's work was done in a very self-serving way , " <PERSON>Zinn</PERSON> said . 
" She took advantage of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's trauma , which I believe happened whether or not the details are as written . 
She wrote an article that claimed to be standing for <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> and now under the public 's scrutinization has thrown <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> under the bus . " 
Schwab agreed , saying this detracted from the good the magazine had done by publishing the original article . 
" They put down <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> in a way in saying that she was not as reliable as they thought she was . 
I thought that was wrong , " <PERSON>Schwab</PERSON> said . 
" To vilify a victim like that , you 're going against the original point of the article , which was to go about sexual assault and recognize how pervasive and evil it is , and here they are not giving a survivor their due respect . " 
In Rolling Stone 's letter announcing the reported discrepancies in the original article , Managing Editor Will <PERSON>Dana</PERSON> said the magazine 's " trust in [ <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> ] was misplaced . " 
First-year College student <PERSON>Ava Koenigsberg</PERSON> said <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> should not be blamed in this situation or treated antagonistically , as such an approach would detract from progress the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> can make to address sexual violence . 
" We 've already seen the way it [ the article ] has affected some people , " <PERSON>Koenigsberg</PERSON> said . 
" I 've already heard people saying that <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> lied and saying that U.Va . 
is n't that bad , but we 're still under investigation and that does n't change that at all . 
We still have to re-examine everything that 's going on . 
I just feel like this article took the wind out of the sails out of the movement and we 're going to lose the urgency to change . " 
Second-year College student <PERSON>Christiana Nguyen</PERSON> shared <PERSON>Koenigsberg</PERSON> 's fear , saying recent events may even discourage future survivors from coming forward and reporting the violence against them . 
" I 'm really angry about the Rolling Stone 's post , even more after their retraction , " <PERSON>Nguyen</PERSON> said . 
" If <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> is n't lying , but just has some discrepancies , now people are further discouraged from reporting rape stories . " 
Despite initially intense reactions , many students said they were waiting for more evidence on both sides to come to light before they made conclusive judgments . 
" I thought [ <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> 's ] press release was everything it needed to be . 
It was neither good nor bad , they gave facts , " <PERSON>Schwab</PERSON> said . 
" For now we have to believe them , and I have no reason not to . 
Innocent until proven guilty , and it seems like they 're innocent . 
I 'm not going to pass judgment . " 
<PERSON>Jack Brake</PERSON> , a first-year College student , agreed , saying it is too early to draw conclusions . 
Furthermore , when people do start making conclusions about this particular case , Brake said it should be done in a way which does n't bear judgment on all issues of sexual misconduct . 
" I do n't think that people should really be drawing conclusions about what 's true and what 's not true right now because everything seems to be so up in the air , " he said . 
" I would urge people to wait until we have a more complete picture of the facts before making any conclusion - and I hope that when people do make their conclusion they 're able to go about it in a way that divorces the particular circumstance described in the article from the larger issue of sexual assault . " 
Brake said he hopes the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community will continue to address the broader issue of sexual assault moving forward . 
" I think we can all agree that even if the article is in some ways false - which would be in many ways tragic - it would n't take away from the fact that there is a real problem on this campus like there are at many colleges , " Brake said .
