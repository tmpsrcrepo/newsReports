<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily blockquote { float : right ; color : gray ; } When Rolling Stone 's disturbing account of the alleged gang rape of a first-year <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student , identified only as " <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> , " was published online the morning of <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE> , the story quickly spread across Grounds . 
Read with a quiet anxiety by many who knew about the article 's pending publication , the story soon picked up steam across the community at large - with Facebook timelines , Twitter feeds , and classroom web browsing dominated by the image of a girl , her head in her hands with illustrated blood striped across her body , and a domineering depiction of the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity house looming behind her . 
The world , it seemed , quickly took notice . 
The heartbreaking story of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's experience and the depiction of maddeningly unsympathetic friends and administrators captivated a wide audience who joined local advocacy groups in calls for justice , for reform and for revenge . 
Now a month since the article 's publication - the page boasting 179,000 Facebook likes and nearly 7,500 comments - questions about the article 's central story have turned the ensuing discussion from one of horror to one of doubt and confusion , with an overwhelming desire to unearth new clues which might shed light on that nagging question : What really happened to <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> <TIME>that night</TIME> ? 
Remembering <DATE>Sept. 28 , 2012</DATE> For third-year Engineering student <PERSON>Ryan Duffin</PERSON> - a friend of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's who was depicted in the Rolling Stone article under the pseudonym " Randall " - reading through the story for the first time was shocking . 
As the article describes , he met up with <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> on the night of her alleged gang rape , responding to a frantic late-night phone call . 
He had just returned from a performance with the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Glee Club</ORGANIZATION> at an event at the Biltmore celebrating the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's spot atop Playboy magazine 's list of party schools for the year . 
He found <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> , sitting on the tables between <PERSON>Fitzhugh</PERSON> and Dunglison dorms , distraught . 
" When I got there , she was sitting on a picnic table , and it looked like she 'd been crying , " he said . 
" She was shaking and her lip was quivering and it really looked like she had been through something terrible . " 
Dufflin called his friend <PERSON>Alex Stock</PERSON> - a fellow first-year student at the time who says he is " Andy " in the Rolling Stone article - who was out with their mutual friend <PERSON>Kathryn Hendley</PERSON> , also a first year . 
They left the party they were attending and walked back - though <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> made clear , Stock said , she did not want <PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> - " Cindy " in the article - to come along . 
" I thought that was really weird , obviously , because we were really good friends at the time and if she were upset I would have thought she would come to me first or at least at the same time as them , " <PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> said . 
" So I went with him anyway . " 
As they approached , <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> called Stock again and asked why he 'd brought <PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> along . 
She opted to stay back while the two talked things over with <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> , and ultimately she went home without ever directly discussing with <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> what had made her so upset . 
The night ended with Stock and <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> sleeping on the floor of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's <PERSON>Gooch</PERSON> dorm room . 
Both <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Stock</ORGANIZATION> said they encouraged <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> to call police , but ultimately she said she wanted to go home . 
Noting discrepancies That was the <TIME>night</TIME> as <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> and Stock recall it - now more than <DATE>two years later</DATE> . 
But when the narrative resurfaced last month in the pages of Rolling Stone , the details were notably different . 
After reading the article , <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> said " almost everything " was different from how he remembered . 
The number of men involved in the incident had changed , <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's rape now involved vaginal penetration - rather than the forced oral sex she recounted to him and Stock in <DATE>2012</DATE> - and she said her date was stopping by the fraternity house to pick something and asked her to accompany him inside , not that she was attending a party at the house , as Rolling Stone published . 
Upon reading the narrative , <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> said he was surprised by the discrepancies - and despite these differences he , like many in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , believed what he read . 
" I thought that it was possible that on the 28th that <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> had kind of downplayed what she was telling me , either as a personal rationalization technique , or just to kind of test the waters and see how I 'd respond to her telling me about this , " he said . 
" So I believed the account in the article once I 'd read it first , too . 
I did n't realize that it was even that bad on the 28th . " 
In the intervening weeks , <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> said he has grown more skeptical of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's account . 
The discrepancies he knows from his personal encounter with her , coupled with <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> 's retraction and <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> 's statement finding key discrepancies through an internal investigation have cast a shadow of doubt across the entire narrative . 
In a series of interviews with <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> stood by most of her story - stepping back slightly on the specific fraternity in question but maintaining the general facts of the narrative . 
An email sent to reporters last week from <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's attorney , <PERSON>Palma Pustilnik</PERSON> , said <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> and her family will not be commenting further on the matter . 
<ORGANIZATION>Fast Friendships & Romantic Encounters</ORGANIZATION> The weeks leading up to <DATE>Sept. 28 , 2012</DATE> were filled with college firsts for the group of four friends - who <PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> said rarely spent more than 24 hours apart . 
<PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> , who met <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> through her neighbor before school started , met both Stock and <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> at <DATE>summer</DATE> orientation , and the four - though they each lived in different dorms - were very close in the first weeks of school . 
Early in <DATE>September</DATE> , <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> began talking about a new romantic interest - a third-year student in her chemistry class who she said had expressed interest in her and was named Haven . 
Haven was the man <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> said she went on a date with <DATE>Sept. 28</DATE> - the one who lured her into the fraternity house . 
Both Stock and <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> asked for his phone number in early <DATE>September</DATE> , which <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> promptly provided . 
Stock said they wanted to talk to him because having an upperclassmen romantic interest was " a big deal for Jackie . " 
When the two began texting Haven , both pretended to be female students from his chemistry class . 
" I think it was a very thin disguise , because I did n't know what I was doing , " <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> said . 
The conversations were sporadic - and only later did <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> realize that he and Stock had received different numbers to contact Haven . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Washington Times</ORGANIZATION> has subsequently reported that the numbers were all registered with online services which " enable people to text without cellphone numbers but also can be used to redirect calls to different numbers or engage in spoofing . " 
Stock says he suspects now he may have been communicating with <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> using a fake number . 
But at the time , he said he had little reason to suspect anything was wrong with her story - except for the fact none of the three of them could find him on Facebook . 
The <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post reports that pictures sent from the phone number to <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> , ostensibly of Haven , are actually pictures of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's high school acquaintance , and that no man by the name <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> provided had ever been enrolled at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Following <DATE>Sept. 28 Hendley</DATE> , Stock and <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> all said <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> did seek help soon after her alleged attack - though she told them the individual she spoke with was unhelpful and blamed her for the assault . 
The three each offered different guesses as to who <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> had sought help from , but all were confident she had told them she visited someone . 
Duffin spoke with his Resident Advisor at the time who advocated respecting <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's desires for privacy , but otherwise none of the three friends brought the issue to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> or police authorities . 
" I should 've though , in retrospect , " <PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> said that after the incident , <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> " seemed fine , almost consistently . " 
He did , however , notice occasional " episodes " in which she seemed to remember and react to her memories . 
" She would kinda just take a quick glance around the room , and her lips would quiver a little bit , and you could see that she was thinking about the 28th , " <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> said . 
" But then after about five or six seconds , she would snap back to being completely normal and it seemed like nothing had happened . 
If you did n't know , you would n't have guessed . " 
<PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> said <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's semester after <DATE>Sept. 28</DATE> seemed relatively normal - it was toward the end of the semester when she noticed <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> would n't leave her dorm room . 
" She would sometimes reference [ her assault ] , but I did n't want to bring it up , " she said . 
" I do n't really know how to bring that kind of thing up , but if she ever said anything about it , of course , I would be supportive . " 
<PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> said the two had a class together the following semester , but <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> was rarely in attendance . 
The friendships eventually faded . 
<PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> said <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> started a personal rumor about her which created a chasm in their friendship . 
She said she tried to reach out to <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> after the article was published but was n't able to get through . 
<PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> said he texted <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> when the article was first published to let her know he still supported her . 
Her lawyer has since recommended she not speak with him , he says , and he has n't been in contact since . 
Choosing to come forward - a call for continued advocacy <PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> said she was troubled after reading the article - which describes her as a " self-proclaimed hookup queen " who callously advocates against calling the police because it would make <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> " the girl who cried rape . " 
" I know that it 's not based in fact , but it 's weird to think other people think of you like that , " she said . 
" It 's kind of a weird out-of-body experience . " 
<PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> said she felt personally attacked by her representation in the article . 
" The whole article was n't targeted toward me , but she made some very disparaging remarks about me , and I do n't really know why she would do that , to me specifically , " she said . 
" Like , <PERSON>Alex and Ryan</PERSON> , she made them seem kind of bad , but she made me seem really awful . " 
Stock was the first of the trio to speak with the press - after a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post reporter reached out to him . 
<PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> quickly followed suit - the ensuing media firestorm clashing with their finals schedules . 
" I 've spent more time with news crews this week than I spent studying for or being in my finals , " <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> said . 
" And I 'm really nervous to check my grades on SIS now because of it . " 
All three said they immediately recognized the story and themselves when they read through the Rolling Stone account , despite the discrepancies in the narrative . 
Ultimately , <PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> said , it is important to set the record straight - so long as it does not distract from the broader issue of combating sexual assault on Grounds . 
" The reporting and the storytelling is a problem , but [ they have ] furthered the conversation about this whole thing , " she said . 
" And now people are focusing on who lies about sexual assault instead of protecting those who have endured sexual assault , which is a lot more important . " 
Stock and <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> expressed similar desires to see the ensuing dialogue fixated more squarely on addressing sexual assault than correcting <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's narrative . 
" Personally , I do n't care whether it 's true or not , because I think it 's much more important that people be looking at the larger issue , " <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> said . 
" Up until Rolling Stone backed up on the article , everyone was taking the article as being fact . 
... People accepted that this was something that could happen at U.Va. , and that in itself , I think , underlines what the larger problem is - which is that sexual assault still happens at <LOCATION>U.Va.</LOCATION> , and still happens at a lot of places that are n't U.Va. , too . " 
Duffin added he hoped the fallout from <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's story would not discourage other survivors from coming forward to share their stories - a concern echoed by many student leaders in sexual assault prevention and advocacy groups on Grounds . 
The fallout Since the three have come forward , and <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> and Rolling Stone have issued their statements , the national attention has turned fiercely toward <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> and her account . 
The attention brought the scorn of many who slammed Rolling Stone for poor journalistic practices and sloppy fact-checking . 
Others have turned anger toward <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> - with one blogger choosing to identify her by her full name and a second Twitter account tweeting out her full name , home address and phone number before the account was banned . 
" I think when I saw that happening , that was the angriest I 've ever remembered myself being in recent memory , " <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> said . 
" Because I think that 's just an absolutely despicable thing to do . " 
The released information appears to have been largely obtained from a digital copy of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> directory , uploaded online by a company called <ORGANIZATION>Around Campus Media</ORGANIZATION> . 
Vice President of Student Affairs <PERSON>Pat Lampkin</PERSON> said <DATE>earlier this month</DATE> she was aware of the website and was working to have it removed . 
It was taken down by <DATE>Dec. 9</DATE> . 
University President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> asked <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Police to investigate the incident described in the Rolling Stone article after it was published . 
Duffin spoke with police before meeting with members of the press , and Stock has subsequently spoken with police . 
As of <DATE>last weekend</DATE> , <PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> had reached out to police but had not heard back with any further communication regarding the incident . 
Both <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> said <PERSON>Sabrina Rubin Erdely</PERSON> , the author of the Rolling Stone piece , has reached out to them to apologize . 
Uncertain Beliefs Moving forward , all three friends said they still believe it is possible something traumatic did happen to <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> <TIME>that night</TIME> . 
" I think that all the possible ways you could explain this incident , all deserve investigation , because I really do n't know what to think , " <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> said . 
" And the only person who really knows for sure is Jackie . " 
Stock said evidence seems to pull in different directions . 
" I do n't know what to believe honestly , he said . 
" I understand a traumatizing event can cause someone 's memory to jumble up a little bit , but there have been some major inconsistencies - including stuff she said before the event , including sending us pictures of a guy who does n't even go to U.Va . 
- that could not conceivably have been related to the trauma . 
... The flip side of that coin is that she did seem really upset that evening . 
If she was acting , it was a very good performance . " 
Stock said theories attempting to explain the discrepancies between the night of <DATE>Sept. 28</DATE> as he remembers it and the account in Rolling Stone " hit a wall . " 
" Why does she come back to <LOCATION>Rolling Stone</LOCATION> <DATE>two years later</DATE> and make it a huge deal ? " 
Stock said . 
" That 's where I 'm having trouble . " 
<PERSON>Hendley</PERSON> said she has reasons to doubt much of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's claim - including , of course , the misrepresentation of her own involvement . 
But she 's not prepared to dismiss the entire trauma . 
" I do believe that something happened , but it was all very exaggerated , " she said . 
" So the exact truth of it , I 'm not sure . " 
Hendley , Stock and <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> all said they are learning new information from reporters about the events of <DATE>Sept. 28 , 2012</DATE> , a night they had not critically examined until recently . 
" I 'm just continuing to piece [ it ] together , " <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> said . 
" Because it 's constantly changing the way that I 'm viewing the story , and this is something that for two years , unquestionably , I was like , ' Yeah that happened . ' "
