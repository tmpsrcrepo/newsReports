The <ORGANIZATION>University of Oklahoma</ORGANIZATION> made headlines last week with the discovery of a video of fraternity brothers in <ORGANIZATION>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</ORGANIZATION> participating in a racist chant - which included lyrics such as " there will never be a n - in SAE " and even lyrics supporting lynching . 
Shortly after this discovery , officials at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Maryland</ORGANIZATION> began investigating an email sent by a Kappa Sigma fraternity brother in <DATE>Jan. 2014</DATE> , which included racial slurs and other racially charged language . 
The universities and national organizations in question have taken swift action . 
The national SAE organization suspended its <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> chapter and the university itself expelled two students ( though the constitutionality of this action has been questioned ) . 
At <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> , national leaders of Kappa Sigma immediately suspended the student in question and are now working to formally expel him from their organization , while the university is investigating the incident through its <ORGANIZATION>Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct</ORGANIZATION> . 
But these investigations and the ensuing dialogue lack the holistic approach necessary to combat the apparent racism persistent on college campuses . 
The expulsion of the students at <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> and the investigation of the <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> student are significant in demonstrating those schools ' zero tolerance for racism , but these actions should not replace university-driven discussion of the systemic nature of racism on campus . 
Developing a constructive approach to dealing with obvious racists is essential for all schools , but so is investigating the environment that can allow such racists to get away with racism . 
Since our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is no stranger to this type of racial scandal , these issues are just as relevant for us . 
At a party jointly thrown by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapters of <ORGANIZATION>Kappa Alpha</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Zeta Psi</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>2002</DATE> , some guests came wearing blackface . 
In that case , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , like OU and <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> , took relatively swift action . 
Both fraternities were initially suspended pending investigation . 
However , once it became clear that none of the individuals wearing blackface were themselves affiliated with either fraternity , both fraternities were reinstated by the school and cleared by the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> of any wrongdoing . 
In that specific case , while members of KA and <ORGANIZATION>Zeta Psi</ORGANIZATION> did not themselves participate in racist activities , they were - at the very least - inactive bystanders . 
We can readily point to the party-goers wearing blackface as racist in their actions - but why not also consider the fact that these two fraternities , by ostensibly failing to criticize these guests and failing to kick them out , contributed to an environment in which racist behavior was acceptable ? 
There are likely many more cases of racism at our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> - both within Greek communities and outside them . 
It is the implicit acceptance of such racist activities that allows the perpetuation of explicit racism - and this makes bystanders culpable . 
Of course , it is immensely difficult logistically to punish a group for contributing to a culture in which racism is tolerated . 
But there are tangible ways to combat this culture . 
Perhaps the first tangible way is to acknowledge its existence - something all universities have failed to do thus far . 
But after acknowledgment comes action . 
At <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown University</ORGANIZATION> , students are currently petitioning for the creation of " Diversity , Power and Privilege " two-course requirement for all undergraduate students which would educate them on " issues concerning race , class , ethnicity , sexual identity , immigration status , gender and gender identity , religious identity and disability/ability . " 
According to the petition , <ORGANIZATION>Cornell University</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Dartmouth College</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Yale University</ORGANIZATION> all have similar required courses . 
The implementation of this type of required course - at all schools - would ensure students learn the impacts of their statements and actions . 
There are inevitably individuals who will remain apathetic to the unethical nature of racism , but there are also individuals who may simply be uninformed or scared to be active bystanders , or who may not understand the full consequences of racist activity . 
Implementing required courses on diversity and privilege would educate such students and possibly ensure the diminishment of environments in which racist behavior is tolerated . 
Our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should strongly consider implementing such a requirement as well . 
It is important to be proactive in the face of racism , and not reactive . 
Statements from the presidents of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Oklahoma</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>the University of Maryland</ORGANIZATION> pointed to the strength of those schools ' respective communities and their intolerance for racism - but clearly pockets of those communities exist where racism is tolerated . 
Those same pockets exist in our community , too , and if a single student is caught saying or doing something racist , calling that student an anomaly only covers up the true problem . 
Racism is not confined to certain outspoken individuals ; it is systemic . 
The only way to cure a systemic problem is to take a systemic approach .
