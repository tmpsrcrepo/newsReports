REMEMBER back in <DATE>2003</DATE> , when Americans learned about the horrible events that transpired at the <PERSON>Abu Ghraib</PERSON> prison facility in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> ? 
Detainees became victims to the humiliating and denigrating bullying of good ole ' American soldiers . 
Undoubtedly , this did n't improve the Iraqi people 's perception of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> involvement in their country . 
So , the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> made it clear that they would n't condone this type of behavior and punished those responsible for the <ORGANIZATION>Abu Ghraib</ORGANIZATION> incidents accordingly . 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government should have realized , however , that punishing soldiers is far more facile than instructing soldiers to behave rightly . 
It 's only recently that this message became clearer than ever . 
<PERSON>James Barker</PERSON> , a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> specialist , along with four other soldiers , was charged with the premeditated murder and rape of a 14-year-old Iraqi girl and her family in <DATE>March 2006</DATE> . 
And on <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE> , <PERSON>Barker</PERSON> pled guilty to rape and murder . 
Given this recent incident , it 's evident that the Iraqi citizens might justifiably be angered over the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> ' continued presence . 
An already precarious relationship between American soldiers and Iraqi citizens has been severely and permanently wounded . 
The crux of the matter is that disrespect , to say the least , is a recurring problem in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> insofar as the conduct of American soldiers is concerned . 
A World Opinion Poll of the Iraqi public indicated that <PERCENT>71 percent</PERCENT> of Iraqis want the Iraqi government to ask the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to withdraw forces within a year or less . 
The poll was also conducted across the major religious factions ( e.g. Sunnis , Shias and Kurds ) with the vast majority of each group indicating a desire for the withdrawal of American troops . 
It 's interesting that despite this large majority opinion that the <ORGANIZATION>United States</ORGANIZATION> should leave <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> General <PERSON>John Abizaid</PERSON> strongly advised that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> exercise " flexibility " in withdrawal timetable rather than instituting an exit timetable . 
One line of reasoning against a withdrawal of troops in the near future resides in his belief that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> " can stabilize <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> . " 
On the contrary , <PERCENT>78 percent</PERCENT> of the Iraqi people believe that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> presence has an overall negative effect in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> , according to another WOP poll . 
According to the poll , many Iraqis are convinced that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> provokes more conflict than it resolves . 
Though <PERSON>Abizaid</PERSON> has argued for the <ORGANIZATION>United States</ORGANIZATION> ' continued presence in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> , he has advised against bringing more troops to <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> . 
Abizaid urges that " it is essential for us to change from us being into the lead to Iraqis being in the lead . " 
The suggestion here is along the lines of self-determination . 
Yet given that the poll accurately reflects the views of the Iraqi citizenry , self-determination would actually favor the exit of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops . 
Then , in fact , the apparently well-intentioned reasoning Abizaid offers flies in the face of genuine self-determination . 
In any case , whether <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops continue to hold out in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> or not , the perception of the American military , if not <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> itself , has suffered significantly . 
America 's inability to quell the violence in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> coupled with the repugnant acts of a handful of American soldiers has convinced Iraqis that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> needs to leave soon . 
It 's only timely that our government reaches the same epiphany . 
Perhaps with the reins of our government in the hands of new leadership , it might be possible to bring about a critical shift in policy in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> . 
And more importantly , opinions of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> abroad will suffer less than it has during our involvement in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> .
