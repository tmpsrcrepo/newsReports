In the movie " Star Trek : Insurrection , " the <ORGANIZATION>Federation</ORGANIZATION> , secretly in cahoots with the renegade Son ' a , is planning to surreptitiously transport 600 <ORGANIZATION>Ba</ORGANIZATION> ' ku off of their planet in order to make use of the rejuvenating rays of the planet 's rings . 
In response to <ORGANIZATION>Captain Picard</ORGANIZATION> 's protest that the involuntary relocation of the <ORGANIZATION>Ba</ORGANIZATION> ' ku is immoral , the <ORGANIZATION>Federation</ORGANIZATION> 's Admiral <PERSON>Dougherty</PERSON> replies haughtily : " Jean-Luc , we 're only moving 600 people . " 
In Abrahamic fashion , <PERSON>Picard</PERSON> counters : " How many people does it take , Admiral , before it becomes wrong ? 
A thousand ? 
Fifty thousand ? 
A million ? " 
At <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , we are wrestling with a similar moral question : When does the number of victims of rape , sexual assault and interpersonal violence among our students , staff and faculty become too many ? 
How many victims must there be before we acknowledge them and unite to eradicate this societal evil from our community ? 
Despite extensive discussion on the prevalence of sexual assault on American campuses , I 've seen neither estimates of the number of possible sexual assaults on Grounds nor estimates on the number of male and female survivors of sexual violence among our students , staff and faculty . 
Considering the enormous personal , social and economic cost of sexual violence , it is imperative that we have at least a rough estimate of the number of annual victims and the number of survivors of sexual assault living and working among us , in order to guide decisions concerning the allocation of resources for prevention of sexual assault and for support of survivors . 
In this article , I summarize calculations using published data from the <DATE>2007</DATE> Campus Sexual Assault Study and the <DATE>2010</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>National Intimate Partner</ORGANIZATION> and Sexual Violence Survey ( NIPSVS ) to estimate upper and lower bounds , respectively , on the number of annual sexual assaults on female undergraduate and graduate students at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
A primary criticism levied against the <ORGANIZATION>CSA Study</ORGANIZATION> is that the statistics obtained from 5,446 undergraduate female students were derived from only two public universities . 
Accordingly , the <ORGANIZATION>CSA</ORGANIZATION> findings , that <PERCENT>15.9 percent</PERCENT> of the undergraduate women reported experiencing attempted or completed sexual assault before college , that <PERCENT>19 percent</PERCENT> of the undergraduate women reported experiencing attempted or completed sexual assault during college and that a total of <PERCENT>28.5 percent</PERCENT> of the undergraduate women reported experiencing attempted or completed sexual assault before or since entering college , can be reliably applied only to the two universities polled in the study . 
These numbers do not differ significantly , however , from the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study findings of over 17,000 adults which concluded the prevalence of contact sexual assault for girls under 18 was <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> . 
Therefore , I use the findings reported in the <ORGANIZATION>CSA</ORGANIZATION> study as an upper-bound estimate of the prevalence of sexual assault on Grounds . 
The NIPSVS contains extensive interview data concerning sexual violence collected from over 16,000 individuals . 
Assuming sexual violence and assault occur uniformly across all socioeconomic strata and that <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students are representative of the American population as a whole , the NIPSVS statistics can be mapped directly onto the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> population . 
Since no one , to my knowledge , argues American campuses are safer for women than other environments , I use these data to produce a lower-bound estimate on the number of sexual assaults on Grounds . 
Mapping the <ORGANIZATION>CSA</ORGANIZATION> data onto the current female undergraduate population at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> provides an upper-bound estimate : 401 female undergraduates who may experience sexual assault yearly ; 1,343 and 1,001 female undergraduates who may have experienced either sexual assault before matriculation or sexual assault while enrolled at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , respectively . 
Thus , 2,344 of 8,445 female undergraduates currently on Grounds ( <PERCENT>27.7 percent</PERCENT> or about one-in-four ) may be survivors of sexual assault . 
Mapping the NIPSVS data onto the undergraduate female student population provides a lower-bound estimate : 77 female undergraduates who may be raped per year ; 607 and 192 female undergraduates who may have been raped before matriculation or who may have been raped while enrolled at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Mapping NIPSVS and <ORGANIZATION>CSA Study</ORGANIZATION> data onto the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student population suggests that between 264 and 401 undergraduate female students at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> may experience sexual assault per year . 
Mapping NIPSVS data onto the student population yields , as a lower bound estimate , 127 on-Grounds female students aged 18-25 who may be raped each year . 
Mapping NIPSVS data onto the female student population provides a lower-bound estimate : 2,086 current undergraduates who may have experienced sexual assault before matriculation and 660 undergraduates who may experience sexual assault while enrolled at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Mapping NIPSVS data onto the female student population yields , as a lower-bound estimate , 4,565 of the 11,500 female students on Grounds , almost four in 10 , who may have experienced sexual assault during their lifetime . 
Mapping ACE data onto the student population suggests that 2,875 female students on Grounds may have experienced contact sexual assault , before ever arriving at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
So like Captain <PERSON>Picard</PERSON> and Admiral <PERSON>Dougherty</PERSON> , we are each called upon to make a moral decision . 
There are likely several hundred sexual assaults per year of just female undergraduates and several thousand female student survivors of sexual abuse on Grounds . 
How many are too many ? 
What is our individual commitment to eradicating this evil from Grounds ? 
As an institution , what financial and human resources do we provide to prevent sexual violence and to support the thousands in our community who have already experienced it ? 
I encourage everyone to support , to innovate for and to participate in the many new and ongoing efforts and programs , especially the Green Dot training , to ensure , as President <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> has declared , that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will lead in the prevention of sexual violence and the support of victims of sexual violence .
