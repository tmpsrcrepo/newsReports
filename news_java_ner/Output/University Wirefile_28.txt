With many students using the Internet on a daily basis , organizations around Grounds are taking advantage of the availability and anonymity the Internet allows . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University Women 's Center</ORGANIZATION> now offers individuals the opportunity to file third-party sexual assault reports over the Internet . 
The reports can be anonymous and can not be traced . 
The third-party report forms can be accessed from the Women 's Center 's web page . 
Previously , anonymous third-party report forms were available at various places on Grounds , such as the Dean of Students Office ; however , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> officials cited the convenience of the Internet as a reason for offering the opportunity to make reports over the internet . 
" We wanted to provide students with another option to report sexual assault , " Sexual Assault Education Coordinator <PERSON>Claire N. Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
All third-party report forms are used for statistical purposes only and cases are not investigated without a request to contact the person who filled out the form , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
" This helps us to keep better track of sexual assaults -- we get the information anonymously off the Internet and give it to the <ORGANIZATION>University Police Department</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
" We could n't contact anyone unless they gave us their name . " 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said there was no indication there would be a rise in reports , but " we are hoping more students will report more incidents , " she said . 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said the idea behind offering third-party report forms on the Internet came from the realization of " how much students use the Internet and to make it more accessible . " 
The Women 's Center 's web page previously had an " un-useful survey on it about general knowledge [ of sexual assault ] and people did n't use it so we decided to reconfigure it , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Spokeswoman <PERSON>Kirsten Curtis</PERSON> said the third party reports will operate the same way they did before , but now police statistics will include reports from the Internet . 
Curtis echoed <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> 's assurances of the anonymity of the reports . 
" We can not investigate unless someone reports it to us -- these reports are generally for statistical purposes , " and sometimes third-party reports are about long-standing incidents , <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Sarah Curtis-Fawley</PERSON> , former president of <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Facts and Education</ORGANIZATION> , was enthusiastic about web access to report forms . 
" One problem with reporting is that people are hesitant to go into public and call attention to themselves by asking for a third-party sexual assault form , " <PERSON>Curtis-Fawley</PERSON> said . 
Curtis-Fawley hoped the forms would give the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> a more accurate picture of the numbers of sexual assault incidents , and where these incidents repeatedly occur so police can monitor better those areas .
