On <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , <DATE>March 26</DATE> , a serious crime occurred in <LOCATION>Cauthen</LOCATION> dorm . 
The crime did not involve an assault , and the only actual threats came from the alleged victim . 
The crime was lying , resulting in exacerbated fears and the misallocation of police resources . 
According to <DATE>Monday</DATE> 's lead editorial in The Cavalier Daily , " The alleged assault can be forgotten ; the concern about crime on Grounds , however , can not . " 
If only it were that easy . 
Initially , we in no way can " ignore " the alleged assault . 
The alleged assault was a lie and a breach of the honor code . 
It also terrified <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> parents . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Department Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Mike Sheffield</PERSON> said he could n't " remember so many concerned parents ' calls " ( " Police expose alleged attack as fabrication , " The Cavalier Daily , Apr. 2 , <DATE>1998</DATE> ) . 
There was no specific victim , as in an assault , but the incident violated the security of both parents and students . 
The media and police are overzealous in releasing the names of accused sexual offenders . 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> printed a woman 's claim that she was sexually assaulted by <ORGANIZATION>National Basketball Association</ORGANIZATION> players <PERSON>Chris Webber</PERSON> and Juwan <PERSON>Howard</PERSON> ( " Wizards official ' angry ' at players , " <DATE>Apr. 8 , 1998</DATE> ) . 
At this stage , authorities have collected little evidence linking the players to the crime . 
If the allegations are true , the media must inform the public of the threat these individuals pose to society . 
On the other hand , why should these allegations be printed before the woman 's story has been even partially substantiated ? 
In cases involving <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> player <PERSON>Dennis Scott</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> player <PERSON>Michael Irvin</PERSON> , charges were dropped because there was no evidence connecting those individuals to their alleged crimes . 
Yet before the allegations were explored , the media readily vilified the players as animals . 
A woman 's name should not necessarily be published when she claims to have been assaulted . 
The alleged victim should have the same level of privacy -- if not higher -- than the alleged assailant . 
It is unclear , however , why police are not releasing the name of the alleged victim in <LOCATION>Cauthen</LOCATION> dormitory on the grounds that they want to protect her privacy . 
She lied . 
She created chaos , fear and heightened security . 
Some could say violating her privacy would stop women who have been assaulted from accusing their attackers , but this makes no sense . 
Releasing her name only would send the message that liars will not be afforded privacy . 
Any woman who actually was assaulted still could have privacy while pressing charges . 
The other argument against releasing the alleged victim 's name is that she possibly is mentally ill . 
Some are claiming that , instead of blaming the girl , we should be worried about her . 
But is n't any individual who commits sexual assault mentally ill ? 
If individuals feel they have the right to violate the bodies of others ; if they do not understand the psychological trauma they create when they assault or rape others , they must be mentally ill . 
There obviously is something unstable in one who rapes or attacks another , but we do n't feel sorry for the rapist . 
We rightly punish this individual , at the very least to protect his past and potentially future victims . 
But can we assume the <PERSON>Cauthen</PERSON> female never before has accused someone of sexual assault ? 
If she wrongly has accused someone of assault before -- even if the charges only served to tarnish the alleged assailant 's reputation -- should n't he have the right to know that his accuser now has been caught in a lie ? 
And should n't males who might interact with this female in the future have the right to know that she has lied about assault before ? 
I sincerely hope we are not protecting the alleged victim merely because of her gender . 
Some claim that at least the false allegations raised awareness of sexual assault on Grounds . 
This is true , but they also occupied eight <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> officers with the investigation of false charges , preventing them from protecting other students and from investigating legitimate charges . 
And let us not forget that even good results such as raising awareness of assault do not justify dishonest acts . 
This anonymous individual must be revealed , and she must be brought up on honor charges . 
Sexual assault certainly is horrible . 
Unquestionably , however , false allegations of assault are not so insignificant that they can be forgotten .
