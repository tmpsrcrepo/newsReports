According to <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> crime statistics released yesterday , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> saw a dramatic <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> drop in crime last year . 
Reported incidents of crime fell from 529 in <DATE>1997</DATE> to 370 in <DATE>1998</DATE> , according to the release . 
Police officials said rape , aggravated assault , burglary , larceny and motor theft all saw fewer occurrences during the last year . 
" We have had a general decrease in crime over the years , but this year it is much larger , " <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Michael Coleman</PERSON> said . 
" We 're very happy about it . " 
While pleased with the decrease in reported crimes , <ORGANIZATION>University Chief of Police Michael Sheffield</ORGANIZATION> warned that the statistics only represented incidents that were reported and occurred on <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> property . 
<PERSON>Sheffield</PERSON> said last year 's high profile rape and sexual assaults helped raise public awareness among <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students . 
" When you have a violent crime , people tend to change their habits , " he said . 
" Those things make people aware that things can happen right in your back yard . " 
Police officials said the difficulty arises in maintaining community interest in crime prevention . 
" There 's a difficulty in building a continuum of interests , " <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said . 
" After a big incident everyone is interested in helping , but that drops off with time . " 
While the exact causes of the crime decrease can not be pinpointed , police said the recent growth in special community programs probably played a role . 
" We believe here that community actions affect criminal activity a great deal , " <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said . 
" Student Watch and the <ORGANIZATION>Escort Service</ORGANIZATION> certainly played a role in our efforts . " 
Sheffield agreed that interest in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community has helped decrease recent crime rates . 
" People are aware and taking advantage of the services available , " he said . 
Student Escort ridership , for example , has increased from 14,348 rides in <DATE>1997</DATE> to 36,845 in <DATE>1998</DATE> . 
Despite the drop in crime , <ORGANIZATION>Sheffield</ORGANIZATION> reminded the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community to remain vigilant . 
" Although <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> is a major decrease , we worry that the community may become lax leading to a future increase in the crime rate , " <PERSON>Sheffield</PERSON> said in the press release . 
" We urge the community to stay involved -- they 're the ones that see things around and the ones that need to let the police know about any incidents that may occur , " <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said . 
But while University-related crime statistics decreased last year , <ORGANIZATION>Albemarle County Police</ORGANIZATION> officials reported a <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> increase in crime within the county . 
According to the <ORGANIZATION>Albemarle Police</ORGANIZATION> report , the majority of the increase stemmed from theft and destruction of property . 
Crimes against persons , such as homicide , robbery and assault , all decreased within the county .
