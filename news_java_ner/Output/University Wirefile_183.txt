It 's almost funny , the things people think it 's acceptable to say to their co-workers -- particularly their female co-workers . 
What is n't funny is when judges -- not defense attorneys , judges -- try to use the First Amendment to excuse inappropriate and threatening comments . 
Earlier this year , four <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> justices asked the state 's Court of Appeals to consider whether a state law prohibiting the verbal abuse of co-workers was a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech . 
The case in question was one of a former <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> police officer , <PERSON>Lynette Burns</PERSON> , who sued her employer when , according to a <ORGANIZATION>Detroit Free Press</ORGANIZATION> report , male co-workers " repeatedly referred to her as a bitch and other , less-printable gender-based epithets , suggested that her disposition would be improved by more regular sexual relations with a man , and hinted that she might face a beating after she complained to superiors " ( " Harassment case becomes a hot potato , " <DATE>June 14</DATE> ) . 
Her supervisors ' response to her complaints was to move her to the lower-paying day shift . 
A jury awarded <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> <MONEY>$ 1.1 million</MONEY> in damages . 
During the case and its subsequent appeal , the defendant 's attorneys never argued that the alleged harassment was protected speech . 
Turns out they did n't have to . 
Four judges , including the <ORGANIZATION>Chief Justice</ORGANIZATION> , a staunch Republican , took it upon themselves to offer that defense . 
Fortunately , <ORGANIZATION>the Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> decided that <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> 's sexual harassment policy is not in violation of the First Amendment after the city attorney admitted that she could n't find a single case to suggest that <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> had any reason to believe that it did . 
Now that <ORGANIZATION>the Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> has passed judgment , <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> can rule on the issue it raised itself . 
Regardless of the court 's decision -- which will uphold the sexual harassment law if the Court has any integrity or common sense -- the fact that the justices asserted the First Amendment objection in the first place raises several concerns . 
If <ORGANIZATION>the Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> had agreed with the justices -- or if the justices themselves make a decision -- <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> 's sexual harassment laws will be rendered essentially useless . 
Free speech , obviously , is one of the country 's mostly dearly held rights . 
The defense of free speech should not , however , allow one person to interfere with the comfort or safety of another . 
The comments made by <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> ' co-workers did not serve any constructive purpose -- they were meant solely to upset and offend her . 
The concept of free speech protects certain actions as " symbolic speech . " 
Similarly , the notion of protection of personal safety should include harassing speech , including threats and repeated , uninvited sexual attention . 
If the Court decides that <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> ' co-workers ' comments should have been protected by the <ORGANIZATION>First Amendment</ORGANIZATION> , it effectively sanctions sexual harassment , and leaves women like <PERSON>Burns</PERSON> ( or men , when the tables are turned ) with little recourse beyond switching to a lower paying shift -- hardly a just solution . 
The justices ' request that the lower court examine the law 's compliance with the <ORGANIZATION>First Amendment</ORGANIZATION> also is upsetting in its own right . 
It is certainly unconventional -- and in this case inappropriate -- for the Court to suggest a defense in a case it may be asked to rule on . 
Should the defense attorneys have suggested free speech violations , a review would have been necessary and appropriate . 
For a majority of justices to step outside of their role as neutral arbitrator is unacceptable . 
It is hard to believe that a court which attempted , without provocation , to gut a fairly standard sexual harassment law will rigorously enforce that law in the future , despite the fact that the city 's attorney could find no evidence that the law is unconstitutional . 
The four <ORGANIZATION>Michigan Supreme Court Justices</ORGANIZATION> already have over-stepped their bounds . 
They would be even further out of bounds if they declared the law in violation of the First Amendment , ruling on an issue they themselves raised . 
The Court should heed the words of <ORGANIZATION>the Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> : " While we respect our <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> 's authority to raise the issue , invoking this constitutional issue to benefit a party who failed to raise the issue would be entirely inappropriate , " ( " Free speech draws line at verbal abuse , " <ORGANIZATION>Detroit Free Press</ORGANIZATION> , <DATE>Nov. 11</DATE> ) and further , they should publicly acknowledge their fallacy in raising the issue to begin with .
