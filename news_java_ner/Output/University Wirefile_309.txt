With the incidents of violent crime on Grounds the past few weeks , it seems to be a good time to remind students about another type of violence affecting the student body : sexual assault and rape . 
According to <PERSON>Allison Motheral</PERSON> , president of <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Peer Advocacy</ORGANIZATION> , or <ORGANIZATION>SAPA</ORGANIZATION> , a group that focuses on helping survivors of sexual assault , sexual assault can be " unwanted touching , threats of physical violence , comments or a teacher or other authority making you feel uncomfortable sexually . " 
Motheral also emphasized that sexual assault is an umbrella term that includes sexual harassment in the forms of inappropriate comments or teasing . 
" Sexual harassment falls under broader category of sexual assault , which not many people think about because people think assault would only include a physical attack , " <PERSON>Motheral</PERSON> said . 
Recently , <PERSON>Jacqueline Chevalier</PERSON> , an alumna from the class of <DATE>2006</DATE> , conducted a survey with <PERSON>Christopher Einolf</PERSON> , a lecturer in sociology at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> , on instances of sexual assault and rape against women at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The survey used the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> state law 's definition of rape : any sexual penetration that occurs against the victim 's will by force , threat , or intimidation or where the victim is unable to consent because she is physically or mentally incapacitated . 
The study found that , of the 779 women who responded , <PERCENT>17.6 percent</PERCENT> reported having been raped during their four years at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Only <PERCENT>10.7 percent</PERCENT> of the alleged rape victims say they reported an incident to the police . 
" This is about as accurate as you are likely to get , " <PERSON>Einolf</PERSON> said . 
He said these statistics may even underestimate the true amount of rape occurring at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Einolf cited underreporting as one cause of this . 
" It is difficult to ask people about sexual assault , because people do n't always want to talk about it . " 
Einolf added . 
<PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , director of <ORGANIZATION>Sexual and Domestic Violence Services</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>UVA Women 's Center</ORGANIZATION> , says " rejection by the community , being told ' It 's your fault , ' and personal shame " are reasons many victims do not share their stories . " 
[ The pain ] does n't go away . 
It stays there and it eats at you , " she added . 
According to <PERSON>Scott Martin</PERSON> , the selections coordinator for One in Four and internal chair of <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Leadership Council</ORGANIZATION> , when people do talk about their experiences with rape or sexual assault , it is often to friends . 
When a woman comes forward about her experience , it is imperative to " first and foremost , listen to her , because if she is not believed , that can hinder the recovery process , " <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said . 
Motheral noted that , statistically , it is unlikely that people will lie about being sexually assaulted or raped . 
" According to the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> Uniform Crime Report , <PERCENT>92 percent</PERCENT> of all sexual assaults reported to police are substantiated , " she said . 
In addition to believing the victim , it is important to avoid blaming her in any way for what happened . 
This is why , according to Motheral , SAPA focuses on what people can do to help a victim after the assault has occurred . 
" Sometimes prevention work can put focus on the wrong place , and the reason it is happening has nothing to do with women and more with the attacker , " <PERSON>Motheral</PERSON> said . 
Martin agrees . 
" A lot of survivors feel like what has happened is their fault in some way , " he said . 
" It is only the perpetrator 's fault . " 
It is often easy to blame the victim in some way , especially if he or she was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the assault . 
According to <PERSON>Chevalier</PERSON> 's study , the perpetrator was using drugs or alcohol in <PERCENT>92.6 percent</PERCENT> of the cases of rape , and the victim was using drugs or alcohol in <PERCENT>83.2 percent</PERCENT> of rape cases . 
" One fear that we had was that these statistics would be used to blame the victim , and the fact that the perpetrator is using drugs or alcohol might remove some of the barriers that might exist of immoral behavior , " <PERSON>Einolf</PERSON> said . 
Martin echoed <ORGANIZATION>Einolf</ORGANIZATION> 's concern . 
" Just because you 're drinking does n't mean you 're saying ' Rape me . ' 
That 's just blaming the victim , " he said . 
Martin added that men are normally the perpetrators , and that he hopes " men will take a more active role in this community or , at the very least , not make these acts of sexual assault and rape . " 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> agrees that men need to be more conscious of this problem . 
" Men need to take responsibility and own their actions and change their cultures , " she said . 
Although <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has taken significant measures to encourage victims to report their cases , such as creating the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> , which handles cases of rape and assault , both <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> and Motheral believe that more can be done . 
" UVA is much more forward-looking than some other universities , but in the past , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has not done as good of a job getting people to come forward or getting people punished , " <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said . 
Motheral pointed out that sexual assault and rape are not considered Honor offenses . 
" We have n't had that many people kicked out of <ORGANIZATION>UVA</ORGANIZATION> for sexual assault , but if someone cheats on a test , they are , " she said . 
As the statistics from <PERSON>Chevalier</PERSON> 's and <ORGANIZATION>Einolf</ORGANIZATION> 's study show , sexual assault and rape are occurring at a rate that many people may find surprising . 
" People do n't want to think about the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> being the kind of place where this thing happens , " <PERSON>Einolf</PERSON> said . 
" People like to believe the world is a fair and good place , and this kind of report challenges that view . " 
According to <ORGANIZATION>Martin</ORGANIZATION> , sexual assault and rape affect many people at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , but it is not talked about as much as it should be . 
" These could be your best friends , and you may have no idea this is happening , " he said . 
" Chances are you know someone right now who this affects , and we should be conscious of that . "
