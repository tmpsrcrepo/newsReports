Neighbors and acquaintances of <PERSON>Andrew Alston</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> student charged with second-degree murder in the <DATE>Saturday</DATE> homicide of <PERSON>Walker Andrew Sisk</PERSON> , 22 , said there was nothing overt in his behavior that made them especially wary of him or made him stick out . 
A third-year College student who frequently studied for physics with <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> said she was shocked by his arrest . 
" I am so blown away , " the student said . 
" I seriously would never have guessed he could be capable of anything like this . 
He comes off as such a sweet guy . " 
Those who lived near <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> at the <DATE>1815</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Jefferson Park Avenue</ORGANIZATION> apartment complex also said he seemed like an ordinary student . 
" My impression of him was that he was not weird , " said a neighbor who had partied twice with <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> . 
" I mean , he looked normal . 
He dressed normal . 
I had been down to their place . 
It was very normal , very college . " 
The neighbor did concede , however , that after returning from a night of partying , she felt uncomfortable with <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> being in her apartment , though she admitted that she could not differentiate whether the cause of the reaction was because of her state or <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> 's presence . 
Second-year College student <PERSON>Brian Siebenburgen</PERSON> and second-year Architecture student <PERSON>Ryan Hickox</PERSON> live immediately across the hall from <ORGANIZATION>Alston</ORGANIZATION> 's apartment . 
Both said they never had a problem with their neighbors . 
" They seem like generally low key kind of guys , " <PERSON>Siebenburgen</PERSON> said . 
Hickox confessed he could not even identify which of his neighbors was <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> , but said generally he has never had trouble with any of them . 
When a police officer arrived and knocked on the door five feet away from their own , both said their first thought was that police were searching for the serial rapist . 
Despite the lack of problems with those who live around him , <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> did have a run in with the law only two months ago . 
<ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Department Capt. Chip Harding</ORGANIZATION> said that on <DATE>Sept. 7</DATE> , police responded to a call from a woman who said <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> had hit her in the face when she attempted to leave a party on the <DATE>1800</DATE> block of <LOCATION>Jefferson Park Avenue</LOCATION> . 
Harding said the woman told police that she was <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> 's former girlfriend and that he had assaulted her in the past . 
That night , in apparent frustration , <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> struck a fan and lamp with his hand , cutting himself , <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
Alston subsequently was treated at the <ORGANIZATION>University Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> emergency room . 
On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>the Daily Progress</ORGANIZATION> identified the woman as <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Karen Graham</PERSON> . 
Police obtained warrants for the assault and battery and took <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> into custody that night . 
He was processed and released on a <MONEY>$ 1,500</MONEY> bond . 
A trial still is pending . 
University spokewoman <PERSON>Carol Wood</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> was not aware the incident occurred and therefore did not take any punitive action against <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> . 
Reached for comment yesterday , <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> said simply that " my prayers are with both the Alstons and the Sisks . " 
<ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee Chair Alexis Gregorian</ORGANIZATION> said she could neither confirm nor deny a case against <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> had been brought in relation to the incident . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> did , however , take prompt action following the alleged murder . 
Within 12 hours of <ORGANIZATION>Alston</ORGANIZATION> 's alleged involvement in the murder of <PERSON>Sisk</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> suspended him . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Undergraduate Record</ORGANIZATION> defines interim suspension as , " Temporary suspension by an official of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> of a student who engages in conduct posing a substantial threat to the health or safety of other members of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> or to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> property , pending a hearing of the offense . " 
A student who is suspended is entitled to a hearing within 24 hours , according to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> regulations . 
If the student is unavailable to attend , the hearing will be postponed until he or she is available . 
Alston presently is being held in the <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville/Albemarle Joint Security Complex</ORGANIZATION> . 
" <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> , top <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administrators decided this individual met the highest bar of someone who threatened the safety and well-being of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community and the surrounding community , " Wood said . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> issued the suspension at <TIME>1:30 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> and notification of the suspension was delivered to <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> . 
Those suspended are barred from <ORGANIZATION>University Grounds</ORGANIZATION> and may not enter without the permission of a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> official .
