FOR A LONG time , the ongoingand seemingly endless debateover the honor system has been something I have tried to avoid jumping in to . 
After all , it is a difficult moral question to reconcile the fairness of the honor system versus the importance of the single sanction and what it says about the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's principles . 
The recent open trial and the ensuing renewal of debate , however , has forced us all to look beyond single sanction and to think about how a case actually gets to Honor . 
From this closer look it becomes evident that a clearer , standard definition of what constitutes an honor violation combined with a better defined line between <ORGANIZATION>the University Judiciary Committee and Honor</ORGANIZATION> would benefit us all . 
Looking into the Constitutions of the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> , they appear at first glance to be very similar . 
Both groups draw their authority from the student body as well as from the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> , both operate in much the same style and both promise to uphold the integrity and values of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
However , there is one critical factor the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> delineates which Honor almost entirely leaves up in the air : what exactly constitutes a violation . 
According to its constitution , the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> has the authority to investigate and provide sanctions for violations based on " the Standards of Conduct adopted by the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>October 1970</DATE> . " 
These 12 standards , which can be accessed via the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> Web site , range from physical or sexual assault to breaking state or federal laws to impeding pedestrian traffic or not complying with a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> official . 
What is critical , is that despite these 12 standards being somewhat generalized they are still specific enough that any student , faculty member or administrator can recognize a violation when he or she sees one . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> 's fundamental basis is very different . 
According to the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Constitution</ORGANIZATION> , the committee will " determine and publicize what constitutes , in the view of the current student generation of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , an honor violation . " 
This is an interesting and very ambiguous statement because nowhere on the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> 's Web site or in any publication I have seen has Honor identified what exactly constitutes an honor violation . 
Along with the necessity of maintaining confidentiality , this means that aside from the standard " lying , cheating , or stealing , " there is really nothing to guide even the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> , much less <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students and staff . 
The problem with this policy is that an honor violation can change daily at the whim of whoever is sitting on a jury . 
Though jurors are educated on procedure and the purpose of honor , there is little that can really be said that will not be an influence on the juror 's decision and thus make the trial inherently unfair . 
Why ? 
Because there are no clear guidelines . 
Critics will argue that it is easy to recognize when someone is lying , cheating or stealing . 
Yet this begs the question : If a violation is so easy to recognize , then why are student initiations so low ? 
More importantly , why is there a need for the seriousness clause ? 
A clear definition of what is and what is not an honor violation would mean that every case reaching trial would by default be considered serious . 
It would also allow for a fair and consistent process for student jurors as well as <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> members to fall back on . 
The other key factor that has surprisingly been less of an issue than it should be is where to draw the line between <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> and Honor . 
The <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> has certain situations laid out in its standards of conduct , yet what is to stop Honor from stepping in and claiming jurisdiction ? 
Moreover , if Honor were to do so , who would get to decide who gets the case ? 
The recent <PERSON>Stephanie Garrison</PERSON> trial shows that occasionally cases are referred from one group to the other , yet the basic flaw remains . 
These inconsistencies and the ambiguity of Honor 's jurisdiction pose a powerful deterrent to student involvement and weakens both systems . 
So what exactly can be done ? 
After all , both Honor and the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> are critical to the integrity of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and are responsible for providing fair judgment to its students . 
To begin , the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> need to have better defined roles , specifically in relation to each other . 
Clearly there are some instances that merit some other punishment -- for example cases of underage drinking -- but that would be dismissed if they directly to Honor . 
At the same time , certain cases such as cheating on a test or plagiarizing clearly belong to Honor . 
Clarifying the proper roles of Honor and the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> , and better defining what violations pertain to each , is critical to maintaining the strength and integrity of the student judiciary system at this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Giving students , faculty and staff the information they need to make a good decision can only add fairness and respect to a much-needed institution .
