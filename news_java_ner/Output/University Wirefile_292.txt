On last year 's <LOCATION>Bid Night</LOCATION> , 15 of 16 members of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Inter-Sorority Council</ORGANIZATION> reported the sexual assault of at least one of their members , according to <PERSON>Michael Goldsmith</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>ISC</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Joint Committee on Sexual Assault</ORGANIZATION> . 
Last <DATE>spring</DATE> , members of the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Sorority Council</ORGANIZATION> created the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Committee on Sexual Assault</ORGANIZATION> partially in response to that finding , <PERSON>Goldsmith</PERSON> said . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> 's agenda is " still in the formation stages , " <PERSON>Goldsmith</PERSON> said . 
This year , <PERSON>Goldsmith</PERSON> sent an e-mail to committee members , all of whom are sorority and fraternity presidents , to encourage discussion and prevention of sexual assault by fraternity members on <ORGANIZATION>Bid Night</ORGANIZATION> . 
Future plans of the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> include the formation of a fraternity-sorority presidential mediation council to facilitate dialogue between fraternity and sorority presidents and members . 
" The atmosphere within the greek system is going to change , " <PERSON>Goldsmith</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Lee Sparks</PERSON> , president of <ORGANIZATION>Delta Delta Delta</ORGANIZATION> sorority , said her sorority took actions to prevent Bid Night assaults , such as the institution of a tougher <ORGANIZATION>Sober Sisters Program</ORGANIZATION> . 
The program was adjusted " just so we knew that there were a definite number of women who were sober and out walking around making sure that women were as safe as they could be , " she said . 
<PERSON>Brian Kohn</PERSON> , president of <ORGANIZATION>Theta Delta Chi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity , described similar actions taken by his fraternity on bid night to prevent assaults . 
" We have brothers in the party staying sober and kind of watching out for guys taking advantage of girls or girls getting really drunk , " he said . 
When women leave parties , he said , " If it seems like a sketchy situation we try to mediate it . " 
However , such measures can only go so far , said <PERSON>Kyle Boynton</PERSON> , president of <ORGANIZATION>Delta Sigma Phi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity . 
" There 's obviously a limitation to what presidents can do once things go behind closed doors , " <PERSON>Boynton</PERSON> said , adding that the high rate of assaults last year did not surprise him at all . 
" I 'm confident that all 16 sororities experienced multiple sexual assaults , " <PERSON>Boynton</PERSON> said . 
" It would be naive to say otherwise . " 
Boynton said the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> encourages everyone to get verbal consent before sex , in addition to " making sure that that person is coherent enough to mean what they 're saying . " 
He added that alcohol is only part of the problem in establishing consent . 
But the act of asking for consent remains unpopular , <ORGANIZATION>Boynton</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" A lot of people think it 's awkward when it really does n't have to be , " <PERSON>Boynton</PERSON> said . 
" We 're not talking about a full conversation , we 're talking about asking , ' Is this OK ? 
Does this feel good ? ' " 
Boynton said resistance to the act of establishing consent comes from both sexes . 
" I 've had conversations with women who said if someone asked something like , ' Can I kiss you ? ' 
they 'd be really turned off , " he said . 
<PERSON>Sparks</PERSON> said many women remain confused about the definition of consent . 
" The effort just has to be made on getting the conversation initiated , " she said .
