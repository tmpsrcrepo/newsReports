Starting <DATE>Mar. 30</DATE> , one of the most prestigious <ORGANIZATION>Ivy League</ORGANIZATION> universities in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> will ban all hard liquor on campus . 
President <PERSON>Philip Hanlon</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Dartmouth College</ORGANIZATION> announced the decision <DATE>Thursday</DATE> as part of the " Moving Dartmouth Forward " program that aims to provide a safer learning environment and alleviate issues of sexual assault and binge drinking that have plagued the school in recent years . 
Specifically , the plan will attempt to stop the possession and consumption of any alcohol above 30 proof , regardless of age . 
Garnering the attention of the national media , <PERSON>Hanlon</PERSON> 's decision has been met with both high praise and strong criticism , including a critique from the <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> of this very publication . 
Many Dartmouth students had an adverse reaction to the decision , noting that the plan is riddled with holes - that it would drive high risk drinking underground , hurt student independence and ultimately fail to solve the targeted issues . 
The Cavalier Daily 's <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> , arguing in tandem with student <PERSON>Doug Phipps</PERSON> ' opinion voiced at The Dartmouth newspaper , asserted the ban would give the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> an undesirable in loco parentis role that would only curb the ability for students to make their own independent choices . 
Still others have praised <PERSON>Hanlon</PERSON> 's decision as a strong first step in finally beginning to tackle the problems of binge drinking and sexual assault , saying most alcohol-related hospitalization cases result from hard liquor overdose . 
Perhaps the most important aspect of <DATE>Thursday</DATE> 's decision was <PERSON>Hanlon</PERSON> 's announcement that the Greek system would not be banned . 
The debate to end the system reached a high point in <DATE>October</DATE> of last year when 230 of the 588 Dartmouth faculty members signed an open letter calling for an end to fraternities and sororities . 
That same month , the managing board of <ORGANIZATION>The Dartmouth</ORGANIZATION> published a hugely controversial piece calling to " Abolish the Greek system " at a school where almost <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of students are affiliated with Greek life . 
Many students feared <DATE>Thursday</DATE> 's decision would announce the end of the entire system , but were left relieved when <PERSON>Hanlon</PERSON> decided against the measure . 
And so the broader questions remain - will ending the consumption of hard liquor really do anything to solve the problems of binge drinking and sexual assault ? 
Or is the Greek system to blame , the real issue here being the culture of wild partying embedded in the American college experience ? 
If anything , flat out banning all hard liquor is not the answer . 
Prohibition is a tactic that has failed in the past , and nothing will stop it from failing again . 
Nor should the extreme measure of ending Greek life be taken ; such a decision would only further alienate the student body from the administration . 
Rather than banning alcohol or ending fraternities , I would argue we must seriously begin to reform the general college culture which pushes alcohol onto an undeserved pedestal . 
For example , take the phenomenon of binge drinking . 
While not definitely not exclusive to American culture , binge drinking is far less prevalent in continental <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> , where moderate drinking is the usually the norm - so much so that the French language did n't even have a proper term for it until just <DATE>two years ago</DATE> . 
Many will argue correctly that this distinctly American drinking culture stems indirectly from fraternities and their monopoly on booze . 
Although this point certainly has some merit , it does not automatically imply the Greek system 's relationship with alcohol should be destroyed . 
Rather , it should be reformed . 
Already , <ORGANIZATION>Dartmouth</ORGANIZATION> 's fraternities and sororities are implementing new programs to end the pledging process , a period of time known for hazing and other dangerous alcohol-related incidents . 
Further steps could be taken to end this monopoly : for example , ending the tradition of primarily dry sororities could help stop sexual assault by allowing sorority sisters to control parties and alcohol consumption . 
Because fraternities are usually the sole groups on college campuses to have easy alcohol access , they by default become the centers of drinking culture , allowing them to singlehandedly shape the method in which alcohol is served and consumed . 
The sad truth of the matter is that the most commonly consumed drug in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is also considered by many students to be a prerequisite for having a good time . 
For males , the machismo of partaking in drinking games has become glorified , the amount of shots one can down a ranking system for manliness . 
Pre-gaming , the act of drinking before an event , has become a ubiquitous part of the contemporary American college experience , perhaps only gaining prevalence after the drinking age was pushed to 21 . 
Hazing , hell week , pre-gaming , drinking games - the overabundance of phenomena connected to binge alcohol consumption betrays the fact that American college culture is obsessed with getting wasted . 
Cracking down on hard alcohol directly will only result in students pushing back . 
Ending the dangerous culture around alcohol consumption should be the real goal of university administrations .
