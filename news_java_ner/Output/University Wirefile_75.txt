No one wants to think that it could ever happen to them . 
But for <ORGANIZATION>two University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> women this week , it did . 
Despite the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's best efforts , sexual assault still takes place in our community a few times a year . 
And as such , every University student should re-examine our methods of prevention and protection . 
Last <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , a man entered a residence near 15th Street NW and Rugby Road and woke up a female resident and her male friend . 
Threatening both with a gun , the man ordered the male student to lie on the floor while he blindfolded and raped the female student . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and concerned parents have offered a <MONEY>$ 10,000</MONEY> reward . 
On <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> , a female student was attacked at <LOCATION>Azalea Park</LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> . 
At about <TIME>1:20 p.m.</TIME> , she was removing her skates in her van when the assailant approached her , threw her on her back , and choked her . 
He threatened her with a knife , but by screaming for help she thwarted the crime . 
The victim also helped the police to catch her alleged attacker , by immediately calling 911 and reporting the victim 's appearance and license plate number . 
In the wake of these two attacks on two members of our community , the <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> and the administration have reinforced their commitment to safety on Grounds . 
Not only are they offering the reward for capture of the <PERSON>Venable</PERSON> assault , they also are looking into adding more lighting and walkways to the area . 
But while incidents like these provide a wake-up call for students in terms of their own safety , these two attacks in particular deconstruct a number of myths about sexual assault - and thus can help us better protect ourselves . 
The word rape often conjures up the same image : A woman walking home alone from a party late at night is attacked by a strange man hiding in the bushes nearby . 
In fact , few rapes take this form . 
And yet many sexual assault prevention programs seem to play to this myth . 
If we hear one thing over and over on Grounds , it is " Do n't walk home alone at night . " 
At every orientation program and every dorm meeting , students are told to use the <ORGANIZATION>Escort Service</ORGANIZATION> , or buddy up when they stay late at the library or a party . 
This advice is important - and key to staying safe on Grounds . 
Unfortunately , it applies to neither of the recent attacks . 
In the first , the victim was neither walking nor alone - she was in her house , with a male friend in the same room , and two roommates in the house . 
The second attack happened in a public park in broad daylight . 
Another common myth is that women are the only victims of sexual assault . 
In fact , as many as one in 10 males are victims of sexual assault , according to <PERSON>Michael Scarce</PERSON> 's study , " Male on Male Rape . " 
In the <PERSON>Venable</PERSON> attack , the male student was not sexually assaulted , but he was physically threatened with a gun . 
And last <DATE>spring</DATE> , a male Lawn area resident was sexually assaulted . 
Though not relevant in the recent cases , it 's important to note that close to <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of victims are raped by an acquaintance , not a stranger . 
According to statistics from the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Justice</ORGANIZATION> , they are raped by an acquaintance in situations like a party or a date . 
Almost <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of sexual assaults take place in the home of the victim or the assailant , according to the <ORGANIZATION>Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women</ORGANIZATION> . 
This kind of rape is the most common , partially because the victim often is n't aware that she is in danger . 
The fact is , rape can happen anywhere , anytime , and to anyone . 
Furthermore , a victim is more likely to be someone who has let down her guard - because the situation seems safe - and is not aware of her surroundings . 
Students also should take steps to prepare themselves in case an assault does happen . 
An attack ca n't always be prevented , but often can be thwarted . 
<DATE>Monday</DATE> 's victim was able to scare her attacker off by screaming continuously and yelling for help - despite his threats that he had a weapon . 
Another potential victim was able to throw off an attacker last year by physically fighting him off . 
While the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> often does emphasize prevention over self-defense , there are a number of opportunities on Grounds to learn how to fight back . 
The physical education department offers a one-credit self-defense course that teaches practical forms of martial arts and often caters to the female body . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University Police Department</ORGANIZATION> offers a self-defense class for women throughout the year . 
Created by the <ORGANIZATION>National Rape Aggression Defense</ORGANIZATION> , the RAD program is a five-day , 15-hour course that emphasizes fighting back against attackers , and teaches increased awareness as well as physical defense moves . 
When it comes down to it , though , the best weapon you have against sexual assault is your mind . 
The more you know about your surroundings , your safety , your community , the better your chances of preventing or thwarting an attack . 
The more you expand your concept of security - whether it be by not leaving a party with that guy you just met , making sure to lock all your windows , or learning self-defense - the less your chances of becoming a statistic . 
And the sooner you realize that it can happen to you , and take steps to protect yourself , the safer you 'll ultimately be .
