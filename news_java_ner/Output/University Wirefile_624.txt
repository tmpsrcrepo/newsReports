<PERSON>Thomas Bynum</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily One Less helped create the Teach Safe Relationships Act bill with <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Democratic Sen. <PERSON>Tim Kaine</PERSON> . 
The bill was presented <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> floor . 
One Less is an all-female student group committed to educating students on sexual and domestic violence and empowering survivors in the community . 
The group was at the center of controversy surrounding the <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> article published last semester . 
Kaine met with One Less last <DATE>December</DATE> to discuss gender violence . 
One Less Outreach Chair <PERSON>Alex Pinkleton</PERSON> , a third-year College student , said the group discussion focused on the importance of early education . " 
[ <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> ] had the idea to create this legislation in an effort to prevent sexual assault , domestic violence and dating violence , " <PERSON>Pinkleton</PERSON> said . 
" One Less stressed the importance of early education regarding safe sexual and emotional relationships as many individuals arrive on Grounds without ever discussing consent or what a healthy relationship looks like , even if they have already experienced sexual activity or a relationship . " 
The Relationships Act would amend the Elementary and Secondary Schools Act . 
The Schools Act is due for reauthorization by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> later this year to include education on appropriate behavior in sexual and domestic relationships as part of already required sexual education courses . 
Though this type of " comprehensive health education " is currently not mandatory in secondary schools , such age-appropriate education may lessen the prevalence of violence within relationships . 
" Education can be a key tool to increase public safety by raising awareness and helping to prevent sexual assault and domestic violence , " <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> said in a press release . 
" But many students are leaving high school without learning about these crimes that disproportionately impact young people . " 
The bill would also aid local and state institutions in completing Title IX requirements and provide grants for the training of secondary school educators . 
" This legislation would assist secondary schools by authorizing grants towards providing safe relationship behavior educational curricula for students and educating staff and administration about this curricula , " <PERSON>Pinkleton</PERSON> said . 
" Finally , it will require that these educational programs be culturally and linguistically appropriate and be based in the numerous studies about the most effective ways to reduce sexual and relationship violence . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Albemarle School Board</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Jason Buyaki</PERSON> said he believes the proposed legislation is an important step towards acknowledging sexual violence , but it will not completely end these offenses . 
" A law wo n't prevent violence , but it will raise awareness and raising awareness can help to condemn behaviors and stop them , " <PERSON>Buyaki</PERSON> said . 
" But it comes down to the individual and if the individual is bent on being violent , then there 's not a lot stopping them . " 
One Less member <PERSON>Evelyn Wang</PERSON> , a first-year College student , said sexual abuse often begins at an early age . 
" According to [ the Rape , <ORGANIZATION>Abuse & Incest National Network</ORGANIZATION> ] , <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT> of survivors are assaulted before the age of 18 , which just shows how the issue of sexual assault is not unique to college students , " she said . 
" The culture of violence begins at an early age and thus needs to be addressed early . " 
With a long process of revision and debate ahead , <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> said she thinks the next steps of passing and implementing the bill will not be easy . 
" We will need student lobbyists to promote this bill , and [ we ] will need to promote it all across the country to raise awareness and support , " she said . 
" We need to fight to get this bill passed , and then we will need to fight to get it implemented correctly . " 
Wang said although sexual education is mandated in some public schools , many schools do not teach it adequately . 
" We do not [ want ] the same to happen with safe relationship training , " she said . 
" Safe relationship training is only effective if the content of the training is good . " 
The members of One Less are optimistic for the future of this bill and hope <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students will stand behind the new legislation . 
" I just want to encourage everyone to write letters to their senators and representatives to support this bill , and to encourage their friends to do the same , " <PERSON>Wang</PERSON> said . 
" We all have a crucial role to play in getting this bill passed , and not a single person [ is ] unimportant . "
