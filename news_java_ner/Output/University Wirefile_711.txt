<PERSON>John Pappas</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> is seeking legal action against Rolling Stone magazine , but as of now not against <PERSON>Sabrina Erdely</PERSON> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> chapter announced <DATE>Monday</DATE> its intentions to pursue legal action against Rolling Stone Magazine shortly after the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Journalism School</ORGANIZATION> released its review of the magazine <DATE>Sunday</DATE> . 
The review detailed the journalistic failures of writer <PERSON>Sabrina Erdely</PERSON> and the Rolling Stone editing chain in the <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE> publication of an article detailing a brutal gang rape of a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student by a member of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> . 
In the wake of the article and the impact it had on the chapter , <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> plans to file a lawsuit against the magazine for defamation . 
As a defamation case , the lawsuit will seek reparations for the injuries <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> brothers experienced as a direct result of false statements made against them in the article . 
While specific details of the lawsuit have yet to be released , legal experts are speculating what it may entail . 
One of the initial clarifications to be made is whether the court will rule the fraternity as a public or private figure . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Law Prof. G. Edward White</ORGANIZATION> said the latter would prove more advantageous to the fraternity during legal proceedings . 
" Given the difficulty of showing out-of-pocket losses in defamation cases , it will be critical in this case whether the fraternity is considered a public figure or a private citizen defamed on a matter of public concern , " White said . 
" Private citizen plaintiffs defamed on matters of public concern can recover if they can show falsity , loss of reputation and a negligent attitude toward whether the statement was false or not - for example , failing to make a ' good faith check ' on the accuracy of the allegedly defamatory statements . " 
As a private figure , <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> would need only prove negligence in checking for accuracy on the part of Rolling Stone , while if considered a public figure , the chapter would need to prove " actual malice " on the part of the magazine . 
Questions have also been raised as to whether the fraternity brothers should sue collectively as a fraternal organization or as individuals . 
UCLA Law Prof. <PERSON>Eugene Volokh</PERSON> said he was not in favor of the idea of the brothers suing individually , especially given that courts generally draw the line well below 80 individuals for organizational cases . 
" The size of the organization does matter , and it cuts against the organization , but what also matters is the nature of the accusation and how it bears against each member , " <PERSON>Volokh</PERSON> said . 
Given the article 's implication that rape was part of a ritualized initiation all brothers had to go through and the lack of evidence linking the brothers in the article to actual brothers in <LOCATION>Phi Kappa Psi</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Volokh</PERSON> said the lawsuit would be better presented on behalf of the fraternity as a collective since the allegations of the article reflected on all brothers equally . 
Though <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> publicly stated intentions to sue the magazine , it is uncertain whether writer <PERSON>Sabrina Erdely</PERSON> will also face legal action . 
<PERSON>Volokh</PERSON> said both the magazine and Erdely are potentially culpable and that restricting the lawsuit to one party may pose problems . 
" Since both of them seem culpable in different ways , I think sueing just one would invite the defendant to say , ' This is the other defendant 's fault ' and would make the jury wonder why the other entity or person was n't sued , " <PERSON>Volokh</PERSON> said . " 
[ This could ] incline the jury maybe to saying , ' Well , this defendant is only responsible for part of the damages , maybe half . " 
<PERSON>Volokh</PERSON> said whether the lawsuit will go to trial by jury is another question entirely . 
He said he had some reservations as to what the best course of action for <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> would be , mentioning that plaintiffs often get a better deal through settlement due to the expenses incurred during trial . 
He said he was doubtful the fraternity would refuse to settle . 
White said he thought settlement would be a less sensible option for <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> and hopes the fraternity will " aggressively pursue " the case to trial , as settlement would provide Rolling Stone the opportunity to avoid having its journalistic practices reexamined in a public forum . " 
[ The fraternity ] is seeking primarily to vindicate its reputation as opposed to recovering a substantial damage settlement , " White said . 
" Any settlement , in my view , should include a very conspicuous public statement by Rolling Stone that none of the practices alleged to have been part of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> 's hazing protocols occurred , and that no members of the fraternity were involved in any assault on ' Jackie . ' " 
<PERSON>Robert Turner</PERSON> , associate director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Security Law Center</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>Law School</ORGANIZATION> , said <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> would have interest in stopping the lawsuit at settlement , explaining the magazine 's insurance company would face risks in a trial setting . 
<PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said if the lawsuit does find its way to a courtroom , <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> will need to provide evidence of the article 's harm to the chapter 's reputation , such as a decline in contributions or a loss of membership - and thus decreased revenue from membership fees . 
While he said no guarantee of legal success can be made for <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> , the conduct of Rolling Stone both in producing and responding to the article will provide a challenge to the magazine 's lawyers . 
" Now that [ Rolling Stone 's lawyers ] have asked top experts to investigate every aspect of the matter and the report is public , and they still have done nothing to hold anyone accountable for all the wrongful things that have been done , I find it difficult to fathom a legal theory by which <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> would lose unless there is some procedural hurdle , " <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said . 
While the lawsuit is on behalf of the fraternity , it ultimately stands for something far greater for the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , he said . 
" Since the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> itself can not sue , in going forward [ <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> ] would be vindicating the reputation of our entire community , " <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said . 
" I think Phi [ Kappa ] <ORGANIZATION>Psi</ORGANIZATION> is in a position to champion not only its own reputation , but that of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> and its living graduates around the world . 
And I will be greatly surprised if they lack the courage to do what they believe is right . "
