Courtesy Shady Records It 's been a year since <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> 's last album , " The <PERSON>Marshall Mathers</PERSON> LP 2 , " was released . 
It 's been 10 years , however , since his last well-received album , " Encore , " dropped , and eight years since his label , <ORGANIZATION>Shady Records</ORGANIZATION> , issued a collaborative release , titled " Eminem Presents : The Re-Up . " 
In <DATE>2006</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>Shady Records</ORGANIZATION> signed <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> , D12 , 50 Cent , <PERSON>Obie Trice</PERSON> , Stat Quo , <PERSON>Bobby Creekwater</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cashis</PERSON> - all of whom are featured on " The Re-Up . " 
Lloyd Banks , <ORGANIZATION>Akon</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Nate Dogg</PERSON> made guest appearances . 
Not surprising given the variety of talent , the album went platinum . 
Fast forward to <DATE>2014</DATE> . 
Gone are 50 Cent , <PERSON>Obie Trice</PERSON> , Status Quo , <PERSON>Bobby Creekwater</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cashis</PERSON> . 
Granted , their music is not as relevant as it once was , but these artists delivered . 
50 Cent 's four albums under Shady went gold , platinum , 5x platinum , and 8x platinum . 
But Shady 's current acts - D12 , Slaughterhouse , <PERSON>Yelawolf</PERSON> , Bad Meets Evil and , of course , producer <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> - ca n't hope to live up to this level of success . 
D12 has not released music since <DATE>2004</DATE> and is largely known for filling space until <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> 's next verse . 
Yelawolf , whose outlandish lyrics give the impression he ca n't take his own career seriously , has not and never will come close to a gold release . 
That said , few were anticipating platinum material with " Shady XV . " 
The effort is primarily an Eminem album . 
There are five songs entirely his and an additional four in which he is featured . 
All in all , the first 12-track CD of " Shady XV " has brought the demise of the highest-grossing rapper to light . 
This is not a new phenomenon . 
The last decade has seen a huge shift in <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> 's music . 
What once were honest , hard-hitting lyrics have turned into aggressive , near-constant shouts which aimlessly insult celebrities with occasional rhyme scheme . 
In a freestyle at the <ORGANIZATION>BET Awards</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> threatened to punch <PERSON>Lana Del Rey</PERSON> . 
Similarly , on the album 's " Vegas , " he threatens to rape <ORGANIZATION>Iggy Azalea</ORGANIZATION> . 
Ironically , <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> seems to be painfully aware his offensiveness does not make up for the lack of groundbreaking music he once produced . 
In " Guts Over Fear , " he confesses : " There 's no more emotion for me to pull from / Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun / So , to the break of dawn , here I go , recycling the same old song . " 
And for the most part , it 's what happens here . 
Furthermore , in the opening track of the album , " ShadyXV , " he openly makes fun of himself saying : " A martyr on a private charter , whose life could be harder ? " 
But as the album continues , all semblance of self-awareness is lost with empty , vain lyrics about status , wealth and degrading women . 
Take " Bane " by D12 , for example : " On another tax bracket and I been cleanin ' my house / But my old habits are in the attic , I 'll pull 'em out . " 
We 've never heard anything like that before , have we ? 
The routine is so boring , in fact , that some of the most energetic moments on the album come from featured artists Big <PERSON>Sean</PERSON> and <PERSON>Danny Brown</PERSON> on " <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> vs. Everybody . " 
Their verses are clever , enthusiastic and memorable , but not much can be said for any of those by the <ORGANIZATION>Shady Records</ORGANIZATION> acts . 
And then there is the second disc , which greatly outshines any recent releases - it 's a greatest hits compilation . 
Obie Trice and 50 Cent 's tracks are a not-so-subtle reminder of both " what used to be " and " what could have been ; " Dr. <PERSON>Dre</PERSON> 's production , if not missed before , certainly is after hearing " The Setup " and " Wan na Know " once again . 
If " Shady XV " is any indication of the direction of <ORGANIZATION>Shady Records</ORGANIZATION> , then 50 Cent , <PERSON>Obie Trice</PERSON> , Status Quo , <PERSON>Bobby Creekwater</PERSON> and Cashis should be praised for their business strategy just as much as for their talent . 
While Eminem solo records have a chance at financial success ( because at the <TIME>end of the day</TIME> , he is still Eminem ) , compilations like this one showcase a concerning lack of innovation for the label . 
It would n't be surprising if this were the second and last Shady Records " various artists " LP . 
As Eminem so candidly told us in " Guts Over Fear , " he does n't have much left to say .
