DontGivetoUVA.com stopped accepting donations in late <DATE>April</DATE> and collected little money during its existence , despite receiving significant attention when it launched in <DATE>February</DATE> . 
The Web site , founded by two <ORGANIZATION>gay University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> alumni , asked potential donors to abstain from giving to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and donate to the Web site instead as a protest against the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> not providing benefits to its employees ' same-sex partners . 
It pledged to use the funds to support the partners and to raise awareness about the issue . 
Although its creators , <DATE>2003</DATE> College graduates <PERSON>Andrew Borchini</PERSON> and <PERSON>Andrew Bond</PERSON> , had hoped to raise <MONEY>$ 100,000</MONEY> this year , <PERSON>Borchini</PERSON> said the site had raised much less by the time it stopped actively soliciting donations in late <DATE>April</DATE> . 
At press time , <PERSON>Borchini</PERSON> was unable to provide The Cavalier Daily with the total amount of donations raised by the site . 
" <MONEY>$ 100,000</MONEY> is a lot of money , " he said . 
" In terms of money , we did n't raise much . 
It was n't much compared to what the [ initial ] goal was . " 
Borchini said he and Bond decided to stop accepting donations in the <DATE>spring</DATE> because they felt <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administrators had become more responsive to the benefits issue . 
" I believe that even the highest ranking of the highest ranking <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> officials want this policy changed , " he said . 
A divisive form of protest since its inception , DontGivetoUVA.com irked some gay rights activists at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> who felt its strong-arm method of trying to deny the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> fund-raising dollars might have only alienated administrators . 
<PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , sexual assault education coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> women 's center and a member of U.Va . 
Pride , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's largest staff gay rights organization , offered a critical assessment of the site 's effectiveness . 
" I think there are personal agendas tied up with it more than [ <PERSON>Borchini</PERSON> and Bond ] realize , " she said . 
" I think they mean well , but it 's backfiring on us . " 
According to <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> , some alumni donated money to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> in attempts to spite <PERSON>Borchini</PERSON> and Bond 's efforts . 
" There are people who have given money to U.Va . 
saying , ' I 'm glad you do n't have domestic partner benefits , ' " she said . 
<PERSON>Borchini</PERSON> said the site was always about more than dollars and cents for him . 
" Collecting money was never the number one priority for us , " he said . 
" The number one priority was bringing attention to this issue . " 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> agreed that the attention brought to the domestic partner benefits debate might be a sort of silver lining to the site 's existence . 
" The good that it did was to raise students ' consciousness , " she said . 
University spokeswoman <PERSON>Carol Wood</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> is aware of the importance many faculty , staff and students attach to the issue of same-sex benefits . 
" Certainly this is an issue that has a lot of support in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community and it is one that we know affects members of our community , " Wood said . 
" I think we will all continue to work within the system to see that progress is made . "
