If the <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> 's infamous Middle Passage were to dry up today , we would witness a trail of mangled human bones stretching from <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> to the ' New World . ' 
With clenched fists and mouths agape , they call out to us from their distant grave . 
We are the descendants of those African people . 
We are honored to pay them our respects . 
On <DATE>July 3 , 1999</DATE> , <PERSON>Wayne James</PERSON> will honor those ancestors and celebrate their descendents . 
Alongside crowds of what he hopes will be millions , <PERSON>James</PERSON> will lower <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> sculptor <PERSON>Eddie Dixon</PERSON> 's Middle Passage Monument into international waters in the <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> , 427 feet off the <LOCATION>New York City Harbor</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Dixon</PERSON> was selected from a pool of more than 350 artists from across the world to design the monument . 
The monument features a 25-foot high bronze arch engraved with scenes from African history , sankofa symbols and hieroglyphs . 
Leading to the arch is a 100-foot-long black granite walkway adorned with bronze sculptures of enslaved <LOCATION>Africans</LOCATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Middle Passage Monument Project</ORGANIZATION> 's slogan is " honoring the ancestors and celebrating the descendants . " 
By allowing blacks a chance to visit the <ORGANIZATION>Middle Passage</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>James</PERSON> will give them a greater connection to their roots . 
Those who can not make the voyage can live vicariously through celebration of this monument , as well as by viewing any of its replicas . 
James 's movement , however , arouses interest in greater sentiments surrounding contemporary race relations . 
Dropping another man 's work into the ocean does not alleviate the horrors of the slave trade . 
Throughout the <LOCATION>Western Hemisphere</LOCATION> , blackness has been ridiculed . 
This results not only from transatlantic slavery , but from the racist ideals that gave birth to and maintained it . 
Why drop a monument to salute that ? 
James is one of those who believes that racism can be eliminated from the thresholds of Western society ; he points to education as the key . 
But is this anything more than one man 's optimism ? 
Recent events in national news say no . 
Just last week more examples of worsening or stagnant race relations made their way into the headlines . 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> papers extensively covered the fatal shooting of an unarmed young African immigrant by four white police officers in front of his home . 
The officers fired more than 41 shots at the man , who , eyewitnesses said , was reaching for keys -- not a gun -- to show police that he lived in the building . 
Racial implications -- that the police were suspicious of the man because of his skin color -- are at the forefront of discussion about this case . 
The racist ideologies that may have led these officers to kill call to mind images of <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> Klansmen lynching blacks in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> . 
They match those , which , 100 years earlier , justified European colonists ' enslavement and murder of millions of slaves . 
How can explaining the history of these racist ideologies cause them to disappear from modern-day life ? 
The ideology of black-and-white racism that has developed in the West in the past four centuries is well known , widespread and deeply embedded in the fabric of our nation . 
No amount of educational Fabreze will help that . 
In a college town , at a time when education about black history is more widespread than ever before , Confederate flags , hate crimes and racial slurs litter streets , sidewalks and dorm rooms . 
The guy who shouts racial epithets at passersby , advocates for the elimination of affirmative action and nepotistic CEOs at Fortune 500 companies all know what they 're doing . 
So , while dropping a monument to slavery in the middle of the <LOCATION>Atlantic Ocean</LOCATION> may not do much to alleviate the results of slavery , when coupled with the other projects <PERSON>James</PERSON> coordinated through the <ORGANIZATION>Homeward Bound Foundation</ORGANIZATION> , it seems that significant progress in race relations may be made at last . 
HBF promotes the lives of blacks around the world in social , economic , political and cultural spheres . 
It aims to preserve pre-colonial African history and demonstrate the contributions of African civilizations . 
The non-profit foundation will assist in recording genealogies of people in the <LOCATION>Diaspora</LOCATION> . 
Strengthening the bonds between <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and her offspring , it hopes to improve the physical and technological infrastructure of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> . 
On-Grounds , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students are making similar efforts to empower descendants of the transatlantic slave trade . 
Alumnus <PERSON>Arkee Hodges</PERSON> founded the Black Fund , a non-profit organization that seeks to utilize a collective black economic strength in order to provide black Americans with the economic and social opportunities kept from them for centuries . 
Hodges has begun tapping various resources -- influential members of local and national organizations , local businesses and residents -- in order to level the playing field for blacks . 
Finally , some black men who are not rap stars , athletes or rape convicts are in the news , and for something positive . 
I can only hope that the missions of men like <PERSON>James</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hodges</PERSON> succeed and that they will not be deterred from their efforts should things get rough . 
They should not be presented with continued obstacles due to the color of their skins and of those they are trying to help .
