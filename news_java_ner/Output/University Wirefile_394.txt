Students in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's public colleges and universities routinely face lengthy suspensions and expulsions if found responsible for serious charges of criminal activity in on-grounds hearings . 
Despite the gravity of the charges and the life-long consequences that may result , most of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> institutions deny accused students the right to hire and be represented by an attorney . 
That unfair dynamic will change if the legislature enacts HB <DATE>1123</DATE> . 
The Cavalier Daily recently ran an editorial opposing this common-sense bill , but the arguments lack merit . 
The managing board opposed the bill in part because it exempts students facing academic charges - like dishonesty or plagiarism - from its coverage . 
The managing board notes that the consequences in those cases are equally severe . 
While it is true that the consequences may be similar if a student is found responsible for academic charges like cheating or plagiarism , courts have historically and correctly found that educators - not lawyers and judges - are best equipped to recognize cheating and to set academic standards . 
The same can not be said when a panel is deciding whether a student is guilty of serious misconduct like aggravated or sexual assault . 
The severity of the sanction is an important factor , but the competency of the deciding panel is equally important . 
The legislation properly accounts for this distinction . 
Another argument The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily</ORGANIZATION> asserted against this bill is equally misplaced . 
According to the managing board , " Students have the power to decide who they want and who they do n't want to be members of their community . 
To give a circuit court the power to reverse a decision to expel a student is to force the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to take back a student who has been determined by his peers to be unwelcome in their community . " 
First things first : Even without this legislation , Section <DATE>1983</DATE> of the Civil Rights Act allows students to sue in federal court for due process violations . 
To date , courts have largely deferred to university decisions , except for instances when the student has demonstrated that the institution 's findings were arbitrary , capricious or otherwise contrary to law . 
HB <DATE>1123</DATE> would simply codify that this is the appropriate standard and make clear that in addition to federal court , the student could also choose to bring his or her action in state court . 
But setting aside the legal point , students at public universities should not be empowered to decide " who they want and who they do n't want to be members of their community " when those decisions are made based on the viewpoints of the student in question or when that decision is the result of an unreliable process . 
The First Amendment and the various amendments that provide for due process unequivocally prohibit that . 
If universities throughout the state were providing adequate due process protections in suspension and expulsion hearings , HB <DATE>1123</DATE> might not be necessary . 
But that is not the case . 
Not only are institutions forbidding accused students from having attorney representation , the <ORGANIZATION>Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</ORGANIZATION> ( FIRE ) , where I work , has received credible reports that some institutions are turning the transcripts of the hearings over to prosecutors . 
Remember , anything a student says in campus hearings is admissible in criminal courts . 
Without a lawyer , students are unknowingly waiving their Fifth Amendment rights . 
A student representative does not have sufficient expertise to recognize where essential rights are implicated . 
They are not an adequate substitute for a licensed attorney . 
Students at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should support this bill , and - whether it passes or not - demand the right to hire counsel for on-campus hearings . 
Until they are afforded this right , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students will continue to be subject to procedures that place their educations and futures up to gamble .
