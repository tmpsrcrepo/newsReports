It could happen to any of us . 
Lots of situations could put you or me in a position of having to worry about an unplanned pregnancy , either for ourselves or for someone close to us . 
Unless that actually happens , it 's hard to say for sure what any of us might choose to do . 
But we can say that having as many options as possible in a difficult situation like that would be best . 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> has taken a big step toward that goal by passing legislation that streamlines the process of obtaining emergency contraception , joining <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> as the only states that have done so . 
Other states , including <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , should follow suit . 
We can imagine many different situations where <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> might be a reasonable course of action for an unplanned pregnancy . 
Condoms break . 
People have sex while drunk and fail to put a condom on . 
Sometimes the pill does n't work . 
No contraception is foolproof . 
Other times , failed contraception is n't the problem . 
Men rape women all the time : In an average hour in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , about 30 women experience rape ( <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> 's <DATE>2000</DATE> National Victimization Survey ) . 
This puts hundreds of thousands of women every year at risk of becoming pregnant . 
<ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> , the so-called " morning-after pill , " consists of two doses of hormones taken 12 hours apart , starting as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse , within 72 hours at the latest . 
The hormones act to prevent the implantation of a pre-embryo into the endometrial lining of the uterus . 
When taken correctly , <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> reduces the risk of unplanned pregnancy by about <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> , and it does so at a cost of only <MONEY>$ 20-30</MONEY> . 
It 's also important to understand the difference between <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> and medical abortion , such as that induced by mifepristone , the abortion drug commonly known as RU-486 . 
<ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> prevents a pregnancy from beginning ; medical abortion terminates a pre-existing pregnancy . 
EC certainly is n't the right solution for everyone who has reason to worry about an unplanned pregnancy . 
It would be a tough choice for anyone in that sort of situation . 
But <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> is the right choice for some people . 
That 's irrelevant , though , if it 's so hard to obtain that it 's not a real option . 
Gaining access to <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> within the narrow 72-hour window of opportunity can be difficult , particularly in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>David Nova</PERSON> , president of Planned Parenthood of the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Ridge</ORGANIZATION> , explains : " It is much harder to access emergency contraception in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> as compared to other states . 
In order for a woman to obtain <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , she must have an established patient relationship with a clinician . 
Once she has been seen by a physician or nurse practitioner and a medical chart has been established , she can obtain a prescription for <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> . 
She must then find a pharmacy that carries <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> -- some choose not to . 
All the while the 72-hour clock is ticking . " 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 's new legislation makes this process less cumbersome by allowing pharmacists to offer <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> directly , condensing the two steps previously required to get <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> into one step . 
This would make it easier for women to obtain <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> in a short period of time without compromising the medical attention they receive . 
Pharmacists would have the same training about how and when to give <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> to patients and would perform the same task of teaching patients about the medicine that physicians currently do . 
Going to a doctor first still would be an option , but it would n't be required . 
At <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> , the situation is slightly better , as students can accomplish both steps at <ORGANIZATION>Student Health</ORGANIZATION> -- by making an appointment first with a <ORGANIZATION>Student Health</ORGANIZATION> physician and then obtaining the medication at <ORGANIZATION>Student Health</ORGANIZATION> 's pharmacy . 
Even so , though , the policy change could still benefit students , many of whom may prefer not to go to Student Health -- where they are likely to encounter people they know -- if they 're considering this sort of delicate , highly personal decision . 
To go elsewhere , though , they must negotiate the same two-step process that women throughout <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> do . 
<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> 's more efficient process will make <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> more accessible for women who decide that it 's right for them . 
It wo n't push <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> on anyone who does n't want it ; it merely makes the treatment easier and faster to obtain . 
That 's crucial with <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> , where a few hours can make the difference between becoming pregnant and not . 
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> has had the opportunity to offer a similar policy when a bill passed the <ORGANIZATION>State Senate</ORGANIZATION> but failed in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Delegates</ORGANIZATION> last year . 
Nova predicts that the proposal will come up for consideration again in <DATE>January 2002</DATE> . 
When it does , the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> should take the opportunity to make <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> more accessible -- not to promote it as the right choice , but to make it a more realistic choice for Virginians . 
It 's simply a matter of having better options . 
We should all want that .
