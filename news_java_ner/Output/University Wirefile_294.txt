The <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> discussed a proposal to enhance sanctions for hate motivated crimes <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> . 
The proposal was suggested by the Ad <ORGANIZATION>Hoc Committee</ORGANIZATION> for Hate Crimes that was established after <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of the voting student body voted in favor last <DATE>spring</DATE> of a referendum which sought stronger sanctions on individuals convicted of hate crimes . 
" Any violation of the <ORGANIZATION>University Standards of Conduct</ORGANIZATION> motivated by the age , color , disability , national or ethnic origin , political affiliation , race , religion , sex ( including pregnancy ) , sexual orientation or veteran status of the victim will be deemed an aggravating circumstance , and will result in a more serious sanction up to , and including , expulsion from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , " the considered proposal reads . 
" From a legal standpoint , we have to respect First Amendment rights , " said <PERSON>Dae-In Cha</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>Asian Business Club</ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION>Darden School</ORGANIZATION> , in a presentation supporting the resolution before the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> . 
" What we have for you today is the culmination of half a year of work with students and administrators . " 
Cha also stated that <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Darden School</ORGANIZATION> students have endorsed disciplinary conduct for discriminatory harassment . 
The committee outlined five reasons why this constitutional change is being proposed : It is legally defendable , it will increase the visibility of diversity , various key constituents in the student body are in favor of the proposal , similar systems have been implemented at other top-tier universities and it makes sure the intent of hate is punished . 
" This is not a question of adding to or modifying the standards of conduct . 
[ The proposal ] does n't address the conduct itself , " <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> Chair <PERSON>Tim Ormsby</PERSON> said . 
" It addresses the motivation [ of a crime ] It has to be alleged that a standard has been violated . " 
<ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> representatives will vote on whether they will send the proposal to the student body as a referendum <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at <TIME>7 p.m.</TIME> in the trial room on the fourth floor of <ORGANIZATION>Newcomb Hall.The</ORGANIZATION> meeting will be open to the public .
