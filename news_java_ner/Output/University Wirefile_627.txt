<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily The University</ORGANIZATION> released a response to the inquiry made <DATE>Dec. 1</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges</ORGANIZATION> , asking the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to outline its policies for handling reports of sexual assaults . 
In a letter to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> , SACSCOC 's vice president Dr. <PERSON>Michael Hoefer</PERSON> , , said the organization expects <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> to take reasonable steps to provide a healthy , safe and secure environment for all students and requests evidence of such progress . 
He also said the inquiry was made due to recent , negative accounts of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> culture in multiple news sources , listing Inside Higher Ed , <ORGANIZATION>Academe Today and Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> . 
As part of its 18-page response , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> described its policy for responding to reports of sexual assaults . 
Those who report instances of sexual misconduct are strongly encouraged by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to report to law enforcement , but are not mandated such a report without the consent of the victim . 
Addressing the fact it has constructed a policy consistent with the Violence Against Women Act , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> said it is the " complainant 's option to notify , or decline to notify , law enforcement . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> also countered SACSCOC 's reference to the article published by Rolling Stone as a reason for prompting a policy review as there had been significant factual inaccuracies in the article . 
" While the Rolling Stone article contained significant factual inaccuracies , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> works with SACSCOC to make certain we engage in best practices as it relates to student safety , " University deputy spokesperson <PERSON>Matthew Charles</PERSON> said in an email . 
" This inquiry has provided the ability for <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> to work with SACSCOC to ensure the safety and well-being of our students , a goal for both our institution and their organization . " 
Many University students - who were unaware of the SACSCOC inquiry - expressed disappointment with the <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> 's response to the issue of sexual assault . 
A fourth-year College student , who wished to remain anonymous , said the school is much more focused on its image rather than making sure students are safe . 
" I do n't think they do a great job [ responding to incidents of sexual assault ] , " the student said . 
" I think they 're really a lot more concerned with the reputation of the school than taking care of the kids . " 
Second-year Engineering student <PERSON>Bobby Alexander</PERSON> felt differently , saying the recent example of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's response to the Rolling Stone article showed appropriate concern . 
" I thought the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> was very proactive with their moves responding to [ reports of ] a sexual assault [ outlined in Rolling Stone ] , " he said . 
" They definitely listened for the input from the community and the alumni alike . 
Also I thought it was pretty cool that they extended the deadline to comment on changes to the policy . 
So it was definitely an adequate response . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual assault policy has come under intense scrutiny in recent months by various organizations and government bodies . 
Earlier this year , a panel of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> senators advanced a bill that would require the faculty and staff of public universities to report instances of alleged sexual assaults to law enforcement , regardless of whether or not the victim consents . 
If the faculty and staff failed to do so , they would be in danger of facing misdemeanor charges . 
Hoefner declined to comment on the subject , saying SACSCOC is still reviewing the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's letter .
