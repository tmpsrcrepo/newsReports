AS I look back on four years as an undergraduate and as a Cavalier Daily Opinion columnist , I ca n't help but recall the wise words T.S. Eliot : " We had the experience but missed the meaning , and approach to the meaning restores the experience . " 
Within this quote is a sentiment I strongly sympathize with -- that a higher understanding of life goes beyond the simple highs and lows of our everyday social experiences . 
I can not say that I will leave this place without regrets . 
When I came to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , I swore up and down that the tragic one-in-four statistic ( referring to rapes and sexual assaults ) would be ameliorated before I graduated . 
Unfortunately , my arrogance produced no results . 
I regret deeply the role of fraternities in this mess , as they intentionally and illegally provide free and unlimited alcohol to minors . 
Many rapes happen in fraternities , yet the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> has done nothing in my four years but provide lip service to the cause . 
Attempts by organizations like SARA to promote respect for women have been met by rude inattentiveness and , ultimately , little or no change . 
This is sad not only for our school , but the many good individuals that partake in the fraternity system . 
I also regret that our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is often unable to differentiate between tradition and healthy growth , particularly in regards to the honor system which is dogmatically defended by ideology that barely corresponds with reality . 
I regret that many if not all of these offenders either use fake IDs to enter bars or have friends that do so , yet remain unwilling to admit that honor is as flexible as any other social concept . 
In the education provided here , I wish that the emphasis was more on the application of ideas and themes rather than the memorization of soon to be forgotten facts . 
This lamentation recalls the sagacious words of <PERSON>J.D. Salinger</PERSON> , who through a fictional character wished that " once in a while ... there was at least some polite little perfunctory implication that knowledge should lead to wisdom , and that if it does n't , it 's just a disgusting waste of time . " 
Most importantly , I regret the inaction on my part to address such problems and better the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
My unforgettable experiences at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> are countless . 
Moving into <PERSON>Bonnycastle</PERSON> . 
Receiving too many e-mails from my RA , <PERSON>Aaron Kurman</PERSON> . 
Discovering my favorite musician , <PERSON>Sufjan Stevens</PERSON> . 
Annoying the hell out of the Democrats e-mail list ( sorry , friends ) . 
Going to Slaughter with my roommate <PERSON>Tom Ross</PERSON> , who has never missed a workout in his life . 
Cliche , but always fun activities like throwing a football on the lawn or reading poetry in the amphitheatre . 
Criticizing the guys that run shirtless but then running shirtless myself . 
Grilling with the guys . 
Four a.m. debates with my friend and future law partner <PERSON>John Moran</PERSON> about the <ORGANIZATION>First Amendment</ORGANIZATION> . 
Hiking to Blue Hole with my other roommate , <ORGANIZATION>Tony Colavito</ORGANIZATION> . 
Directing the class film . 
Going to the best BBQ in the state of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> with my advisor , <PERSON>Charles W. McCurdy</PERSON> . 
Writing a full-length screenplay . 
Spilling ice tea on Dean <PERSON>Nicole Hurd</PERSON> 's chair at a dinner right before she walked into the room . 
Stealing my hallmate 's bed first year and convincing him that it was burnt down in a tragic smoking accident ( <PERSON>Kevin Dunlevy</PERSON> , if you were curious ) . 
Laughing at the super competition among girls at the <ORGANIZATION>AFC</ORGANIZATION> . 
Protesting the latest of many mistakes by President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> . 
All-nighters for stupid classes with my friend from high school and roommate , <PERSON>Matt Thorne</PERSON> . 
Going to talks at the <ORGANIZATION>Comm</ORGANIZATION> . 
School for the free Mellow Mushroom but ending up enjoying the talk anyway . 
Beating my fifth ( and last ) roommate , <PERSON>Paul Stucke</PERSON> , in twenty-one , though he wo n't admit it . 
Receiving fan ( and hate ) e-mail for my columns . 
Writing my last column after four years of column writing . 
Okay , I might as well mention <PERSON>Kyle Rudzinski</PERSON> , my suave roommate and good friend from second year -- look out for that kid . 
More important than the experiences , however , were the people that colored them . 
First and foremost , my loving parents , who despite my most rational objections , always believed in me . 
I shudder to think what I would have become without their love , their trust and their wisdom . 
Next , I can not say enough about the dedication and commitment of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's faculty . 
Prof. <PERSON>Brian Balogh</PERSON> in the history department and the <ORGANIZATION>Miller Center</ORGANIZATION> is someone who every undergraduate would do well to know . 
His unbelievable faith in me has been the source of much inspiration . 
<PERSON>Wayne Cozart</PERSON> , who has treated me to countless lunches and conversations , is truly one of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's greatest assets . 
Dean <ORGANIZATION>Hurd</ORGANIZATION> , who I now consider a close friend , was finally recognized by the state of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> as our best public servant -- she deserves it , and I feel bad for all of the undergraduates who will not meet her as she moves to UNC next year . 
Next , I do n't know if I could have found a better advisor than I did in Prof. <PERSON>Charles W. McCurdy</PERSON> . 
It has been an unbelievable pleasure and a privilege to be under his tutelage . 
Beyond the faculty , I 've met some of my best friends here at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , some of whom I 've mentioned , all of whom have put up with my shortcomings while encouraging the best of me . 
With their help I 've managed to grow and develop , not only socially and intellectually , but morally and spiritually . 
I started my final column with a quotation then discussed my regrets , experiences and relationships at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
I find it all too fitting that I end with a quotation from the same poet , <LOCATION>T.S.</LOCATION> Eliot : " We shall not cease from exploring , and at the end of our exploration , we will return to where we started , and know the place for the first time . " 
With respect to my undergraduate career , this is in a sense where I am . 
Thank you to all the wonderful people that have brought me here .
