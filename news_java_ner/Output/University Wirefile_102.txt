Recently , the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> published the disturbing , if not unexpected , results of a survey on the climate towards homosexuals in the military . 
The study , which covered 39 bases and 11 vessels , revealed not only widespread hostility towards gays but also a troubling tolerance of that attitude by officers . 
A problem of this kind clearly requires a response . 
Unfortunately , the political nature of the " Do n't ask , do n't tell " policy will hamstring the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> 's response . 
Last <DATE>summer</DATE> , a private at <LOCATION>Fort Campbell</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ky.</LOCATION> murdered a gay fellow soldier . 
In the aftermath of the widely publicized incident , the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> decided to investigate the implementation and success of the " Do n't ask , do n't tell " policy among the servicemen . 
The results revealed a deep problem . 
Of the 71,000 service members surveyed , <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> said they had heard offensive or derogatory remarks aimed at gays , and <PERCENT>85 percent</PERCENT> believed that other service members tolerated such comments . 
Around <PERCENT>37 percent</PERCENT> said they had witnessed or experienced an event of harassment due to a servicemember 's perceived sexual orientation . 
Five percent believed that the chain of command tolerated such behavior . 
While most incidents of harassment were verbal , physical assault , career limitation and vandalism each accounted for about <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> . 
According to the report , most harassment came from co-workers . 
Disturbingly , however , the study found that immediate superiors perpetrated more than <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of incidents . 
Some groups have responded that even the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> report did not express the situation adequately . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Servicemembers Legal Defense Fund</ORGANIZATION> charged that the survey was inaccurate because some soldiers could not respond without exposing their sexuality and violating the policy . 
The <ORGANIZATION>SLDN</ORGANIZATION> 's own report , " Conduct Unbecoming , " paints an even harsher view of the military . 
The <ORGANIZATION>SLDN</ORGANIZATION> report documents 968 incidents of verbal or physical gay bashing during the year starting in <DATE>mid-February 1999</DATE> , more than double the 400 recorded the year before . 
It also reported 665 instances of " asking and pursuing " the question of a serviceman 's sexuality . 
Most troubling , the <ORGANIZATION>SLDN</ORGANIZATION> reported that over the six years since the " Do n't ask , do n't tell " policy was initiated , no servicemen have been held accountable for asking or pursuing . 
The reports disagree to the extent of the problem , but only in the most minor way . 
In both cases , the numbers do n't lie : Anti-gay sentiment in the military is pervasive and occasionally escalates into violence . 
That must be ended . 
The nature of the problem suggests some obvious solutions . 
When incidents of harassment are reported , they must be pursued and the perpetrators disciplined . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> should take steps to ensure that servicemen whose sexuality is discovered as part of the course of such an investigation are not kicked out . 
Fear of being outed as part of an investigation prevents many reports . 
More importantly , those who violate the policy by investigating a soldier 's sexual orientation must be punished . 
The " Do n't ask , do n't tell " policy is meant to work two ways . 
So far it has only been enforced in one . 
If gay soldiers can not be open about their sexuality , then officers and other soldiers can not pursue the question . 
The utter failure of the military to enforce " Do n't ask " ensures that the climate of harassment will continue . 
The key , however , is enforcement of the policy by and among the officers . 
Misbehavior among the enlisted men is a black mark on the military , but disobedience by the officers is intolerable . 
Officers are always expected to set the example for enlisted men . 
Enforcement and education should be strictest among officers . 
If they do n't make an effort to improve the climate in their units , there will be no change . 
These responses , however , face a problem due to the political nature of the policy . 
Because it is a campaign issue , the future of the policy will be in question following the election this <DATE>November</DATE> . 
Vice President <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> has promised to push for a more open military policy , while <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON> ( R ) has voiced his support for the current policy . 
If the future of the policy is not certain , it will be difficult to formulate an effective response to the problem . 
The military climate towards homosexuality must improve . 
Not only gays but also straight soldiers suspected of being gay have felt ill effects from the widespread hostility in the armed services . 
Some obvious responses can be implemented immediately . 
Others , however , must wait on the next administration , diminishing the effectiveness of any changes .
