Two weeks ago , <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> students lined the sidewalks by <PERSON>Garrett Hall</PERSON> and the Amphitheater in silent protest against sexual assault -- and the university 's asinine way of handling it . 
The sexual assault policy had been discussed recently in the media , most notably in a revealing article in The Hook about <PERSON>Annie Hylton</PERSON> , a student fighting the university 's procedures , and the flaws in the policy . 
Yet , it was perhaps this eerily powerful demonstration , consisting of hundreds of students , that finally pierced the hearts of our administrators . 
The administration is often criticized for its slow response to some issues or sometimes accused of ignoring them completely . 
This debate usually emerges after some kind of racial incident occurs in the community . 
But over the Thanksgiving weekend , I was delighted to find an e-mail in my inbox directing me to a link on the university Web site , which revealed itself to be a statement on the matter from <ORGANIZATION>President T. Casteen III</ORGANIZATION> himself . 
It reads , and I happily quote , " Vice President [ for Student Affairs <PERSON>Patricia ] Lampkin</PERSON> believes , as I do , that changes to the policy prohibiting sexual assault , and the adjudication guidelines administered by the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> , are warranted now . " 
The statement goes on to say that the proposed changes to the policy have been published for the community to review , and that <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> is actually seeking student feedback . 
As <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> says , " I invite comment from all members of the university community as we review the proposed changes . " 
This chain of events is simply student activism at its best . 
Students saw a problem , they spoke out and now they finally have the ears of the administration . 
Everyone who participated in that demonstration gets a gold star in my book . 
The administration should also be commended for their swift response and their willingness to include university students in the decisions that will ultimately affect them . 
The administration is often censured in situations like these , but this time , they did it right . 
The proposed changes , however , do not seem to address some of the larger issues at stake here : The confidentiality rules for sexual assault , adjudication and mandatory expulsion for convicted rapists . 
The proposals that are posted on the university Web site include enhanced training for members of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> and a decrease in the size of the hearing panel , a new and separate " Sexual Misconduct " offense to encourage more reporting , pre-hearing investigations and clarifying the university 's support system and resources for sexual assault . 
These proposed changes are all very necessary , and will be helpful in dealing with future cases of sexual assault on Grounds . 
But it 's the confidentiality agreements that have many students up in arms , because victims are n't allowed to speak about their experiences , even if the accused has been convicted . 
According to proposed changes to the policies published by <PERSON>Lampkin</PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> Web site , " While the university believes its confidentiality policies are in compliance with federal law , in light of a recent ruling by the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> involving <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown University</ORGANIZATION> , it is reviewing them with <ORGANIZATION>General Counsel</ORGANIZATION> to be sure they strike an appropriate and lawful balance between the rights and interests of the immediate parties and the greater community . " 
The university can review the policies with <ORGANIZATION>General Counsel</ORGANIZATION> , but it should also review them with students . 
They affect us , after all . 
The other big issue in the matter is punishment . 
<PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> mentioned in his statement that he is " prepared to consider the merits of mandatory expulsion as a single sanction " with regard to students convicted of sexual assault . 
Yet this single sanction is n't included in the proposed changes , nor is it really mentioned anywhere else at all . 
Does the administration not seek student feedback on punishment as well ? 
They should . 
<PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> 's attacker was convicted by the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> , yet he was merely banned from certain buildings on Grounds and told to stay away from her . 
He remained at the university and received his diploma , while <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> faced <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> charges and possible expulsion if she talked about the procedures and lived in constant fear of running into her own rapist . 
Something needs to change . 
University students and administrators have done a commendable job recently in addressing the sexual assault policies , and have truly shown the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to be a community of trust . 
But there is still much to be improved in the university 's procedures , and the administration needs to make sure that students are included in every proposal , every ruling and every regulation . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Leadership Council</ORGANIZATION> is holding an open forum tonight , which all concerned students should attend . 
We , after all , are the ones at stake here .
