Inter-Sorority Council officials said better awareness and several new changes allowed numbers , efficiency and excitement for rushees to improve over last year 's process . 
ISC Rush Chairwoman <PERSON>Liz Gagliardi</PERSON> said the number of women registered to rush this year were much higher than last year 's total of 722 . 
<PERSON>Gagliardi</PERSON> said she made a conscious decision not to annouce this year 's total because of past problems with the press . 
Additionally , actual pledge numbers have risen as well . 
Despite losing one house , <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Omicron Pi</ORGANIZATION> , to recolonization , 486 women accepted bids this year , <ORGANIZATION>ISC Public Relations</ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON>Amy Morton</PERSON> said . 
Last year , 450 women accepted bids . 
" We think at the end of the continuous open bid process , that number will reach 500 , " <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> said . 
The open bid process allows rushees to accept bids up to a couple weeks after they are given . 
" Ninety-five percent of the women who went through the entire process got a bid , and of those women , <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> got their first choice , " <PERSON>Morton</PERSON> said . 
In response to neighbors ' complaints , <ORGANIZATION>ISC</ORGANIZATION> voted earlier this year to eliminate the dancing and yelling outside sorority houses that typically accompanied the rush process . 
With the new change , " second-year rushees found the process more dignified and less intimidating than <DATE>last year</DATE> , " <PERSON>Gagliardi</PERSON> said . 
<ORGANIZATION>ISC</ORGANIZATION> members also noted that with less yelling they were able to pacify fed-up neighbors , save their voices and keep fatigue to a minimum . 
But some said the change had a negative effect on the rush process . 
There " was an excitement that was lost over past years . 
The yelling was two minutes or so for us to be silly and have fun , and now we ca n't do that , " <ORGANIZATION>ISC Community Relations</ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON>Lynn Demong</PERSON> said . 
<ORGANIZATION>ISC</ORGANIZATION> officials said the increase in interest is attributable to an upgraded effort to improve awareness about rush before the process began . 
Sorority members donned rush pins and shirts , and sorority members went to dormitories before rush registration to answer women 's questions . 
<PERSON>Gagliardi</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>ISC</ORGANIZATION> plans to continue such practices next year . 
The sorority houses also tried to make the rush process itself more user-friendly . 
Most rounds of rush were on weekends so rushees would not have as many academic conflicts . 
Additionally , rush remained at four rounds after <DATE>last year</DATE> 's drop from five rounds . 
Officials also made improvements in the post-rush pledging process , during which fraternity and sorority pledges are required to participate in peer education classes . 
ISC Educator <PERSON>Sara Pappas</PERSON> said the classes address issues of concern " not just related to those in the greek system but for everyone , " including drinking , date rape and drugs . 
In conjunction with <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> Educator <PERSON>Eric Giesler</PERSON> , <PERSON>Pappas</PERSON> arranged for the classes to be mixed according to gender : one sorority together with two randomly selected fraternities . 
Educators used to conduct the classes at each house with no inner-mixing . 
<PERSON>Pappas</PERSON> said she hopes the change will encourage debate among fraternity pledges who have been reticent in the past .
