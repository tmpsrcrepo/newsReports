" Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guiness is finally finished . 
You now officially have the right to slap bi ** hes . 
You have the right to remain violent and cause riling . 
Get in a fight with the guy who kept eyeing you . 
Drive over the island and start a 42 car pile up . " 
I guess that 's why they call him Slim Shady . 
No explanation can really justify these lyrics off <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> 's latest album . 
You can say <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> has the right to free speech like anyone else , that people are too sensitive , or that he 's just doing it for publicity and should be ignored . 
But you should not be too offended by Eminem because his lyrics are scandalous simply because they can be . 
They are a front for the fact that <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> is out to establish himself as a rapper and defy white stereotypes of musicians . 
Hiding behind his bodyguard Free Speech , Eminem always will be protected against the barrage of criticism hurled his way . 
So rather than agonizing over his harsh lyrics , we should consider the motivation behind them . 
Eminem is a brilliant rapper , but he definitely tries too hard to say the uncouth . 
He spits out venomous lyrics about drugs , alcohol , rape , misogyny , murder and assault just like a lot of rappers . 
And like his '80s gangster rap predecessors , he is pushing the envelope a little further , forcing a Congressional committee to put his lyrics on an easel and ask senators to say each line slowly and deliberately on C-Span . 
" B * # * h , I 'm going to kill you , " pronounced Senator <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON> in a recent <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> committee hearing . 
" What is going on here ? " 
But <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> is also very different from his rap predecessors -- let 's be honest . 
Eminem is white . 
Despite his performance this <DATE>summer</DATE> with the " Up In Smoke " tour featuring Dr. <PERSON>Dre</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Snoop Dogg</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Warren G</PERSON> , Eminem always is reminded that he is not black . 
And although he travels with a well-established entourage and is embraced by rap geniuses like Dr. <PERSON>Dre</PERSON> , he must always cope with his position as the first in what may be a long line of white rappers like him . 
This does n't justify what <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> says , but thinking about him within this racial context explains a lot . 
He slanders white celebrities more than black ones , particularly the pop culture redundancy of <LOCATION>Britney</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Christina</PERSON> and N'Sync . 
He 's determined to remove himself from the mainstream MTV media . 
This is fine -- music lately has become too generic and empty . 
But the irony of <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> is that no matter how hard he tries to detach himself , he still is grouped with the same white people he makes fun of . 
This month , <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> was featured on the cover of <ORGANIZATION>Teen People</ORGANIZATION> magazine , a publication that targets 13-year-old girls and usually has Backstreet Boys pull-out posters . 
He appeared on the <ORGANIZATION>MTV Video Music Awards</ORGANIZATION> followed by a herd of white T-shirt and blue jean wearing clones . 
He then won the awards for Best Male Video , Best Rap Video and Video of the Year . 
Eminem 's need to identify himself as an edgy rapper , not a cheesy pop musician , makes him speak of the unspeakable . 
From threatening to beat <PERSON>Christopher Reeves</PERSON> with his own legs to making fun of the <LOCATION>Columbine</LOCATION> shootings , there is no need for <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> to say some of the things he says . 
Even the fans who defend him ca n't help but cringe at his lyrics . 
That 's the point . 
By systematically alienating himself from the media , fans and critics , <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> can instead assert himself on his own terms as a hip-hop artist and push aside the mainstream that labels him white . 
We overestimate Slim Shady and think everything he does is to make people mad . 
Instead , we should consider how his decisions help him in a personal and career-oriented way as well . 
Eminem does n't want to go down in history as the first white rapper to appear on the scene , yet he is always forced into that corner . 
You do n't see Snoop on the cover of Teen Beat magazine , because there is a clear understanding of who he is . 
Similarly , until Eminem can define this space for himself , he will keep describing scenes that make any listener wince -- from a drunk man driving into a river with his pregnant wife in the trunk to <PERSON>Tommy Lee</PERSON> abusing <PERSON>Pamela</PERSON> . 
As college-age listeners , where does our responsibility lie ? 
This music is definitely harmful to younger kids , but does that mean we have to forgo listening to Eminem if we want to ? 
In some ways , no , because every decision we make does not have to take into account the general masses . 
We should be able to do what we want to and listen to what we want to without constantly worrying about how it effects all of society . 
In other ways though , when <ORGANIZATION>Eminem</ORGANIZATION> keeps begging us to get mad , it makes it a little discouraging to want to listen to him . 
I 'll listen to Eminem because I think he 's a good lyricist and has fresh beats . 
I wo n't however , get mad when he discusses killing his mother because like most kids our age , I can discern between identity and insecurity .
