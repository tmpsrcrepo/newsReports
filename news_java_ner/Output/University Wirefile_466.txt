Groups around Grounds and throughout the state are working this month to bring heightened attention to the issue of domestic violence in recognition of <ORGANIZATION>Domestic Violence Awareness Month</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>National Coalition Against Domestic Violence</ORGANIZATION> dedicated the month of <DATE>October</DATE> to the issue in <DATE>1987</DATE> . 
At <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , the Gender Violence and Social Change program at the <ORGANIZATION>Women 's Center</ORGANIZATION> is partnering with <ORGANIZATION>Sigma Psi</ORGANIZATION> Zeta sorority and the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition</ORGANIZATION> to recognize the cause . 
" <DATE>Three years ago</DATE> , we learned that <ORGANIZATION>Sigma Psi Zeta</ORGANIZATION> 's philanthropy was [ raising money to combat ] domestic violence , " GVSC Director <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
" They were planning a couple of events , so we contacted the leadership and jointly sponsored events together . 
... That was the beginning of a great collaboration . 
We 're delighted to work with the Sigmas on such an important series of events . " 
The Women 's Center is also partnering with the <ORGANIZATION>Red Flag Campaign</ORGANIZATION> , a " public awareness campaign designated to address dating violence and promote the prevention of dating violence on college campuses , " according to the group 's website . 
Bystander intervention is the primary focus of the campaign , which asks communities to look for " red flags " of dating violence in the relationships around them . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> recently launched its own bystander intervention initiative entitled " Hoos Got Your Back , " which aims to educate members of the community about the importance of bystander intervention in combating sexual violence . 
" Students are the heart of the Center , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
" Ending sexual and relationship violence will take the whole community , both on and off Grounds . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has participated in the Red Flag Campaign since it began largely due to the combined efforts of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> faculty , staff , students and advocates associated with the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Sexual and Domestic Violence Action Alliance</ORGANIZATION> . 
At the end of the month , the Women 's Center will sponsor <ORGANIZATION>Red Flag Week</ORGANIZATION> , which will feature several events and resources surrounding the issue of domestic violence . 
Prior to and during Red Flag Week , students can sign the #hoosgotyourback pledge or plant a red flag in exchange for a sticker of the initiative 's logo . 
In a press release last week , <ORGANIZATION>Attorney General Mark Herring</ORGANIZATION> recognized <DATE>October</DATE> as Domestic Violence Awareness month . 
He highlighted several services available to victims of domestic violence in the Commonwealth as well as ways to spread awareness . 
" The first step in addressing domestic violence is acknowledging , as a society , that it is a problem and accepting the responsibility of addressing it , " Herring said in the release . 
" Domestic violence can leave a lasting impact that affects families for generations , but by intervening early to connect victims and vulnerable people with the resources they need , we can help break the cycle of violence and prevent re-victimization . " 
In an effort to raise awareness , <ORGANIZATION>Herring</ORGANIZATION> visited Safe Harbor , a <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> area shelter and resource center for victims of domestic and sexual violence , to speak with the staff and to thank them for their work . 
He also dropped off 47 medication lockboxes , one for each domestic violence shelter in the commonwealth , with the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Sexual and Domestic Violence Action Alliance</ORGANIZATION> .
