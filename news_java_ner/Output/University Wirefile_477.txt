<LOCATION>California</LOCATION> recently enacted a " Yes Means Yes " law , creating an affirmative consent standard at state-funded colleges and universities . 
With this standard , sexual partners must verbally give their consent to sexual activity ; anything less is sexual assault . 
While this policy may offer better boundaries for what qualifies as sexual assault - and those boundaries can at times be unclear - it does so at significant costs . 
<PERSON>Ezra Klein</PERSON> , founder of <ORGANIZATION>Vox</ORGANIZATION> and a proponent of the law , admits that " two college seniors who 've been in a loving relationship . . . who , with the ease of the committed , slip naturally from cuddling to sex , could fail [ the law 's ] test . " 
This is because affirmative consent , though it should be encouraged , is unrealistic ; even discounting the ambiguities of hook-up culture and alcohol - or drug-induced encounters , people do not generally explicitly state their consent before having sex . 
And , if they do , it is unlikely they will repeat this statement of consent throughout intercourse , which , with this law , could be necessary in some situations . 
To be clear , a culture of affirmative consent should be promoted . 
A lead editorial from last semester cites a study in which only <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of female students reported giving consent through body language , while <PERCENT>61 percent</PERCENT> of male students said they interpreted consent through body language ; on the other hand , <PERCENT>51 percent</PERCENT> of female students reported giving consent verbally , and <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> of male students said they received consent that way . 
Obviously , communication between these two groups is ineffective . 
But that does not mean policy will shift this dynamic , or that this is the right one to do it . 
The <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> law distracts us by implying that diminishing ambiguities should be the focus of anti-rape advocacy , when in fact most rapists are recidivists without issues of communication leading to their actions - suggesting that the issue we should focus on is adjudicating rape , not creating a new definition for it . 
Even so , it is still easy , particularly when it comes to sexual assault on college campuses , to favor overreaching over under-reaching , especially when schools appear to be apathetic to this issue . 
But , regardless of our rightful frustration with colleges ' responses to sexual assault cases , we can not ignore the importance of the rights of all parties in a case - including the accused , who will now be held to a drastically different standard . 
Given how colleges handle sexual assault , it may seem that defendants have too many privileges . 
This past <DATE>summer</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>James Madison University</ORGANIZATION> punished three students who filmed their sexual assault of a female peer with " expulsion after graduation " - in other words , no punishment . 
Students have sued the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> for alleged attempts to dissuade victims from coming forward . 
According to <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> , associate dean of students and the current chair of the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> , since joining the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>2004</DATE> and becoming Chair in <DATE>2006</DATE> she is " not aware of a student being permanently expelled for sexual misconduct . " 
However , while schools obviously need to address sexual misconduct on their campuses much better than they do now , this does not mean requiring affirmative consent - which could penalize many non-offenders - is the answer . 
The " Yes Means Yes " law would not affect issues of due process , but it could lead to unfair convictions , since cases of consensual sex in which this consent was not explicitly stated have been redefined as sexual assault . 
Our current definitions of rape and sexual assault are not controversial ; it is the lack of response to those acts that is . 
Cases such as the one at <ORGANIZATION>JMU</ORGANIZATION> meet the widely-accepted standard of sexual assault ; schools simply do not acknowledge this in their rulings . 
Requiring affirmative consent distracts from these schools ' failures and instead effectively penalizes insensitive behavior . 
Beyond what we can clearly identify as sexual misconduct , we can not broadly criminalize treating people badly . 
Many sexual encounters can be demeaning or unpleasant , but that does not mean they are necessarily assault . 
<PERSON>Kat Stoeffel</PERSON> outlines such situations in her persuasive piece , " It Does n't Have to Be Rape to Suck . " 
She demonstrates how women find themselves in situations that " fall outside the conventional definition of rape but nonetheless reflect a gender power dynamic that leaves women sexually vulnerable . " 
Should we create a culture in which this is not the case , power is balanced and everyone treats each other well ? 
Absolutely . 
Will this law do this ? 
Probably not . 
The testimonies will still be " he said , she said , " since either side can claim virtually anything about what verbal exchanges occurred pre - , during and post-coitus . 
Though it may avoid definitional ambiguities , this law does nothing to avoid the evidentiary problems of finding out what truly occurred , since this information usually can only be gotten from the parties themselves . 
If schools do n't want to convict offenders ( and it appears they do n't ) , they will still simply side with the offenders ' testimonies . 
Sexual assault is rampant on campuses , and offenders should be punished - and they can be , under current standards . 
Much of the time the issue is not a lack of evidence or too high a standard for conviction ; it is a lack of willingness on the part of schools to properly handle this issue . 
Affirmative consent places the burden on students in response to colleges ' failures to properly adjudicate even the most blatant cases of rape . 
This is not an effective or fair response .
