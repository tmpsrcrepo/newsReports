Seriously ill patients seek their doctor for medical help , treatment and advice . 
However , these same patients , when confronted with the harsh reality of their grave situation , often may lean on their doctor for spiritual guidance as well . 
So what does a doctor say to an ailing individual who asks , " Why did God do this to me ? " 
What advice can the doctor give then ? 
In an emotional Medical Center Hour -- a weekly conference concerning social and cultural health issues -- yesterday afternoon , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> Drs. <PERSON>Margaret E. Mohrmann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Deborah E. Smith</PERSON> recounted some sensitive , challenging , non-textbook questions that patients often present . 
They also explained ways people -- both sufferers and healers -- can cope with such stresses . 
More than 130 people attended the presentation , entitled " Suffering 's Witness -- The Problem of Evil in Medical Practice , " held in the <ORGANIZATION>Jordan Hall Conference Center Auditorium</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Mohrmann</PERSON> , an associate professor of pediatrics and a member of the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Program of Humanities</ORGANIZATION> in Medicine , explained how patients ' suffering has the power to revolutionize a patient 's spiritual belief system . 
Smith , also an associate professor of pediatrics , gave examples of young patients she has seen , crippled emotionally and physically , whose parents and relatives have asked her outright , " How can God do this to my child ? " 
She cited the case of four-year-old Crystal , who had a cancerous eye removed . 
But that was the least of this little girl 's problems . 
Crystal 's mother asked <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> to find out if there was any medical evidence proving Crystal had been sexually abused . 
When <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> evaluated Crystal , she noticed no signs of sexual abuse , which relieved the worried mother . 
However , also in her inspection , <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> discovered that the girl had no vaginal opening -- a rare and devastating anatomical anomaly that is very difficult to explain , <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> told the captivated crowd . 
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said she informed <ORGANIZATION>Crystal</ORGANIZATION> 's mother of the abnormality , who then asked her the difficult question of God 's purpose of such a fate . 
<PERSON>Mohrmann</PERSON> , author of the <DATE>1995</DATE> book Medicine in <ORGANIZATION>Ministry</ORGANIZATION> , said that , in general , people usually hold two common beliefs about God : that God does active , purposeful things in our lives , and that God is good and loving . 
Thus , often patients ask doctors how an illness can " make sense " and " how God can let this happen , " she said . 
She added that when a negative twist of fate does arrive , most people " accommodate the reality of evil " and simply reorder their thinking about God -- and sometimes even about their infirmity -- so that they can deal with the emotional and spiritual pain . 
Some patients ponder the problem of what they have done to deserve the illness , or even view it as a time for " personal growth , " <PERSON>Mohrmann</PERSON> said . 
Regardless , both women stressed that doctors can not shy away from " why me ? " 
questions . 
" Even when we have no [ advice ] to give , we can respond in human ways , " like listening , which lessens the patients ' anxiety , fear or anger , <PERSON>Mohrmann</PERSON> said . 
They said addressing tragedy square in the face is best + for the doctor too , who deals with complex patient issues daily . 
" I tell stories , share [ experiences ] and teach [ students ] to reduce the burden of such emotions , " <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said . 
" If I did n't attend to emotions rapidly , they would come back and bite me later , " <PERSON>Mohrmann</PERSON> said . 
Medical Prof. <PERSON>Julia Connelly</PERSON> , who moderated yesterday 's session , also emphasized the need for doctors to be attentive to patients ' emotions , not just the science of their conditions . 
" It 's important for doctors not to compartmentalize or stick only to science , " <PERSON>Connelly</PERSON> said . 
" Use the heart and the head . " 
<PERSON>Mohrmann</PERSON> said that giving people emotional support is a characteristic of all humans , even " those whose organizing matrix is science . "
