ON SUNDAY , <DATE>March 22</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> ran the first of a series of five articles entitled " Reality Check : the Gender Revolution . " 
A project of the <ORGANIZATION>Post</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Henry J. Kaiser Foundation</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Harvard University</ORGANIZATION> , this series is based on national surveys conducted on contemporary issues . 
And it makes an appalling first impression . 
The suggestion that the world would be better off if it never had progressed past the 50s in terms of gender roles underlies the article . 
" Kids are n't being raised , they 're just growing up . 
Nobody 's getting married anymore . 
There 's no respect between men and women [ or from ] children to their parents , " <PERSON>Rose-Pierre Louis</PERSON> , a <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> social worker , told the <ORGANIZATION>Post</ORGANIZATION> . 
Many men and women complained in the article about the stress new terms of equality placed on them . 
According to statistics , many women have a hard time coping with both a job and the relentless feeling of " being on duty " at home . 
Some men also voiced this complaint . 
The problem , hints the article , stems from the growing number of women stepping away from the home to forge their own identities as opposed to strapping themselves to hearth and husband . 
That is a mighty heavy burden to place on the shoulders of more than half the population . 
Despite the " stress " of gender equality on today 's men and women , this idea of reverting back to the social norm of " Ozzie and Harriet " is absurd . 
The attainment of the equality today 's minority groups enjoy was no cake walk , either . 
Bringing black slaves into modern society is a process that has taken over 135 years of toil . 
Although the barriers minorities face today pale in comparison to those of yore , the battle to fine-tune our attitudes toward people of other ethnicities continues with fervor . 
Advocating a return to the gender roles of the to the <DATE>1950s</DATE> is like suggesting a return to antebellum <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> in terms of civil rights . 
So why should we " declare a cease-fire " on gender issues , as suggested in the " Reality Check " articles ? 
They are more biological in nature than those of race , but women consistently have proven themselves physically and mentally equal to men when given the chance . 
The first female cadets at <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Military Institute</ORGANIZATION> successfully reached the end of the " Rat Line " on <DATE>Monday</DATE> , <DATE>March 16</DATE> , marking their completion of six months ' worth of abuse at the hands of upperclassmen . 
Their achievement demonstrates the physical and mental capabilities of women . 
When asked to comment on the success of <ORGANIZATION>VMI</ORGANIZATION> in the integration of women , <PERSON>Marcia Greenberger</PERSON> , co-president of the Women 's Law Center -- which monitors the women 's assimilation -- told the Post : " It would be foolhardy to make any judgment about how VMI is doing , " taking a wisely cautious attitude toward declaring success or failure While this may represent a crucial success in the war for gender equality , the military , as well as every other institution , can not afford to let down their guard . 
But deeper concerns about gender issues also must be treated with caution . 
One is the shadow of sensitivity , cast by the growing threat of sexual harassment over the work place . 
The number of such cases -- which pague even the higest offices in the land -- indicate the magnitude of this problem . 
Case in point , former Sergeant Major of the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Gene C. McKinney</PERSON> , was tried on 18 counts of sexual misconduct and cleared on all of them . 
Even so , he has been stripped of his rank and pay-grade , and has received a reprimand for obstructing justice . 
This offense never would have occurred , however , without the initial accusation of harassment . 
It 's a tough pill to swallow , even for the most stoic of soldiers . 
Though he and his lawyers would like to pursue his accusers for robbing him of his career and his happiness , they fail to take into account the pain and isolation those women suffered and still suffer in stepping forward and taking him to court . 
Moreover , such a pursuit would be a direct assault on the women 's rights to due process of law and might force other victimized women back into the closet because of fear . 
Sexual harassment is a huge gray area that begs for clarification . 
Though we have a long way to go before the system is perfected , we would shoot ourselves in the foot if we gave up now . 
Despite the losses both sides may incur , sexual harassment cases must be tried . 
They are the growing pains necessary to make the work place a suitable environment for the advancement of both men and women . 
The issue of gender equality merits continued attention . 
Maybe we do need a reality check , but not the dismal kind the <ORGANIZATION>Post</ORGANIZATION> has in mind . 
America has come a long way in the fight for gender equality , but it is a never-ending road to perfection .
