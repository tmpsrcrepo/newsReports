It 's not always the thought that counts and sometimes , good intentions are not enough . 
<DATE>Thursday</DATE> 's Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> rally started with good intentions and ended up creating a dangerous precedent for the annual gathering and similar events . 
Although the organizers did not intend to advocate murder as an answer to domestic violence , that is exactly what they did . 
The vigil portion of the rally featured testimonies by three women imprisoned for murdering their abusers . 
The women are incarcerated in the <ORGANIZATION>Fluvanna Correctional Facility</ORGANIZATION> and could not attend the rally , but a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> graduate read written statements detailing their abuse . 
The atmosphere of empowerment that characterizes the annual event was sullied and politicized by the inmates ' testimonies . 
Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> is an event designed to support victims of sexual assault and domestic abuse . 
Victims need to know that they are not alone , and the rally provides an opportunity for them to share their experiences . 
The rally is an influential and emotional experience , empowering victims and non-victims alike . 
But people without murder convictions could have given equally compelling testimonies without presenting violence as an appropriate answer . 
This year , Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> legitimized murder . 
It condoned violence as an answer to violence by simply presenting three written statements . 
What 's worse , this disregard for responsibility came out of an otherwise positive force . 
Testimonies at the annual event influence emotionally vulnerable and thus impressionable women . 
Victims who share their experiences empower others . 
They become heroes by virtue of their courage in telling their stories . 
They also become role models for women in abusive relationships , and what they say and how they act is important . 
But murderers are not appropriate role models . 
Violence is not an option , and should not be glorified . 
The testimonies were not accompanied by any sort of disclaimer condemning murder , or even a statement saying that the organizers do not condone violence as an answer to abuse or sexual assault . 
<ORGANIZATION>National Organization for Women President Areshini Pather</ORGANIZATION> said that the purpose of the testimony presentation was not to condone murder but to represent " women who could n't be with us [ <DATE>Thursday</DATE> ] because of domestic violence . " 
Domestic abuse or not , these women were not at the rally because they committed the ultimate violation of human liberty -- taking another person 's life . 
The circumstances of the violation are important to consider , but they do not absolve the women of murder . 
Regardless of the circumstances , these women should not be celebrated or glorified . 
Nor should they be shunned or condemned . 
Their circumstances deserve pity . 
To honor them , however , is virtually criminal in itself . 
How many women at the rally are currently in abusive relationships ? 
How many will be raped or abused ? 
According to the <ORGANIZATION>National Coalition Against Domestic Violence</ORGANIZATION> , <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of all women will experience abuse in an intimate relationship . 
The testimonies rally participants heard and the concept of heroism involved in those testimonies will stay with them . 
If even one person takes from <DATE>Thursday</DATE> 's rally the idea that murder is an answer to domestic abuse and then perpetuates the idea verbally , or , God forbid , puts it into practice , the positive effects of the rally will be lost . 
According to NCADV , the majority of women in jail for killing men have been abused by those men . 
Their stories are heartbreaking and the results tragic , but to condone counter-violence and especially murder is irresponsible and self-defeating . 
Take Back the <TIME>Night</TIME> and similar events should focus on educating women who have not fallen victim to abuse or assault , and on supporting those who have . 
In their fervor to empower and support women , the organizers of Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> forgot the weighty responsibility they held . 
They disregarded the impact of the rally , the effects of the testimonies and the vulnerability of the participants . 
The credibility of their anti-violence message and the integrity of the event now are in question . 
Although the damage has been done , it could be at least partially reversed by a public statement or retraction . 
It is the only responsible thing to do .
