University of <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> football coach <PERSON>Brady Hoke</PERSON> and athletic director <PERSON>Dave Brandon</PERSON> have come under fire after <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> quarterback <PERSON>Shane Morris</PERSON> continued to play in a game even after exhibiting signs of a concussion . 
According to Inside Higher Ed , thousands of students have signed a petition demanding these athletic officials be fired . 
It is not clear what the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> 's response will be , but this incident has revived a debate about whether the <ORGANIZATION>National Collegiate Athletic Association</ORGANIZATION> should regulate how coaches handle injuries . 
Currently , the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> only recommends best practices , but these recommendations must become regulations in order to be at all effective . 
The <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> has authority over college sports teams and therefore has power to influence their behaviors . 
Sanctions against schools who compromise the health of their athletes would provide stronger incentives to abide by the " best practices " that already exist . 
We opposed the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> 's sanctions against <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania State University</ORGANIZATION> following the <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky</PERSON> abuse scandal in part because individual universities can better establish and regulate policies about reporting sexual misconduct . 
The NCAA does not have any expertise on that matter . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> case proves the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> has the power to reprimand an athletic program with financial penalties and sanctions , but they must exercise this power only in response to matters where they do have expertise ; procedure for athlete injuries is one of those matters . 
The <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> ought to take a codified moral stance against compromising athletes ' well being , as they attempted to take a moral stance against covering up child abuse . 
Fines or harsher sanctions , like revoking post-season capabilities , would discourage coaches from putting students at risk , and send the message that such practices are wrong . 
Some argue that athletic departments can be rebuked by other parties that are more reliable than the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> . 
The demand of 10,000 <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> students could be an example . 
But relying on individual schools to hold their coaches accountable would likely not result in consistent practices and punishments , especially since football is such a lucrative sport . 
Schools with high-profile football programs may be more reluctant to fire a coach who has successfully led the team to many championship titles , even if he has mishandled situations with injured players . 
Another potential concern about <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> sanctions is that they would create more incentive to hide injuries in order to avoid penalties . 
This is why doctors must play a crucial role in assessing players ' health and delivering professional opinions during games . 
The doctors would have to be paid by the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> rather than the team , to ensure their recommendations are made objectively . 
Protecting the health of athletes may be a collective responsibility which also involves universities , lawmakers and regional conferences . 
But that does not mean the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> can refuse to take a stand on the issue , assuming another party will handle the problem . 
The <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> has the opportunity to affect the widest change because it has the broadest reach over college athletics . 
With so many new concerns emerging about the physical damage sports , especially football , can inflict on players , now is the time for the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> to make safety a top priority .
