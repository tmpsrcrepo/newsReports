On <DATE>Feb. 18</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>The New York Times</ORGANIZATION> published an article reporting attempts by legislators in 10 states to pass bills that would legalize carrying guns on campus as a measure to reduce instances of sexual assault . 
Five days later , The Cavalier Daily 's <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> issued a response in which it vehemently refuted the notion that firearms would increase safety on campus ; this argument was in line with a previous article in which the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> congratulated the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> senate for striking down a bill that would allow concealed carry on college campuses . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Managing Board</ORGANIZATION> 's stance was controversial - as could be seen in the comments on their pieces . 
One commentator wrote , " I think people should have the right . . . to defend themselves . . . even if some people have a distaste for firearms or the second amendment . " 
Students and faculty are statutorily prohibited from carrying weapons on Grounds , and though most students at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> are unlikely to be packing heat at any given moment , almost <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> of Americans believe handguns - which exclusively target other human beings - should be widely allowed . 
In this assertion there is the persistent and increasingly arcane notion of frontiersman-like independence . 
Other commenters point out that , regardless of the passage of open carry bills , " criminals " - presumably people inclined to commit sexual assault - do not follow the law anyway , and so , would they desire to wield a weapon , would simply do so . 
In their argument , more people should have guns in order to defend themselves against violent violators of the law , because the law itself does nothing . 
Reality does not reflect this clean binary between " criminals " and the law-abiding ; you are more likely to be harmed by someone you know , and whom you would probably not identify as a " criminal . " 
Sixty-two percent of Americans think having a gun in the home makes it safer , yet only about a third of Americans own guns . 
However , the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> still has the highest rate of civilian-owned guns in the world , which correlates to the most firearm related homicides among developed nations . 
Gun owners are also more likely to identify as " typical Americans . " 
Why ? 
Denizens of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> can assert a host of positive national characteristics : relatively high ethnic diversity , increasing innovation and investment in sustainable energy ( particularly wind and solar power ) , comparatively transparent government . 
Yet , for many , to be a " typical American " means to own a device singularly designed to harm others . 
To be a typical American is to affirm a manifest distrust in institutional means of individual safety , namely the law and those hired to enforce it ; skepticism over police conduct is growing , particularly in regard to treatment of ethnic minorities . 
The " typical American " exists outside of time , embodying a radical , Wild West individualism that plays a prominent role in the legend of the origin of the American state . 
Hardy and defiant , the typical American values freedom above all else , particularly freedom from social ties and obligations . 
This manifest destiny freedom is incongruent with participating in a social world , and guns serve as its physical manifestation of this freedom : touting gun ownership as the ultimate means for personal defense betrays a certain cultural defensiveness , by which we eschew aid from our community or our government and take matters - firearms - into our own hands . 
This locked-and-loaded liberty only serves to insulate Americans from each other , prompting a-social distance and lack of empathy . 
Excessive individualism is a contributing factor for pervasive loneliness and an atmosphere of public distrust , both of which play a role in the prevalence of mass shootings in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> : between the <LOCATION>Newtown</LOCATION> massacre in <DATE>Dec. 2012</DATE> and <DATE>June 2014</DATE> , there were 74 shootings on or near schools . 
All human beings are capable of violence . 
Yet this Hobbesian reflex is checked by " informal social controls , " or interpersonal and community relationships . 
In the <ORGANIZATION>United States</ORGANIZATION> , far more so than in other industrialized countries with high rates of gun ownership - such as <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Finland</LOCATION> - it is easy , and some would even say crucial , to be alone . 
Here , you pull yourself up by the bootstraps ; you do n't ask for help . 
This culture of hyper-individualism perpetuates skewed notions about mental illness , particularly depression - which is catalyzed and exacerbated by loneliness - and makes it less likely that those affected will seek treatment . 
However , mental illness is not the source of gun violence in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , as " fewer than <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of the 120,000 gun-related killings in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> between <DATE>2001</DATE> and <DATE>2010</DATE> were perpetrated by people diagnosed with mental illness . " 
Alienation , however , might be . 
Violent crime with guns both perpetuates and is a product of our notion of the " typical American . " 
It allows us to be reflexively and lethally antagonistic , at the expense of cohesion and in the face of deteriorating social trust .
