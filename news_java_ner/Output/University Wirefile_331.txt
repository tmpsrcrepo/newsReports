AS I prepared myself to write on strides <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has made in race relations , I opened The Cavalier Daily and read about a fresh incident of racial harassment . 
I had really hoped we were past all this ; it seemed that the better part of my first semester here was dominated by a flurry of similar events . 
But near the end of the article the idea of a diversity pledge for first years caught my eye . 
At first I was skeptical , as first years are inundated with enough pieces of paper , forms , and seminars from roommate agreements on down . 
Upon further reflection , however , the proposal holds up under scrutiny . 
The idea of a diversity pledge at first glance appears trite , and if viewed flippantly by those signing it , it really is . 
After all , it is just a piece of paper that would ask students to " treat all people with dignity and respect , discourage others ' prejudice in all its forms , and strive to maintain a climate for work and learning based on mutual respect and understanding . " 
According to <PERSON>Ryan McElveen</PERSON> , chair of the <ORGANIZATION>Student Council Committee on Diversity Initiatives</ORGANIZATION> , it would be a voluntary " pledge against prejudice " signed by first years at the end of their first semester . 
It probably would not have any sort of procedure for its enforcement and would therefore lack any sort of coercive power . 
The real value of the proposed diversity pledge would be like that of any other pledge . 
It would make those who value their given word think twice before violating something by which they promised to abide . 
In this sense , it would be like the Honor pledge in its most ideal sense . 
In a utopian community , the honor code would prevent students from lying , cheating or stealing simply because they had agreed not to do so . 
They would care more about the shared values of all <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students than any personal gain that might be gleaned from the banned practices . 
The entire student body would work together in maintaining a strict environment of integrity as stated by the honor code . 
But in practice , more often than not it takes the threat of the single sanction and expulsion to enforce it . 
The key , however , is the " more often than not . " 
While many students clearly do not care about cheapening the value of their spoken or written word , as can be seen by the annual number of honor trials , surely there remain some who place some importance on honoring their word . 
<PERSON>McElveen</PERSON> said that the main goal of pledge would be to inspire people to take time for " personal reflection " and in doing so prevent inflammatory outbursts . 
Therefore , if the purpose of such a pledge is to prevent incidents of intolerance , it could be considered a success if it were to stop even one . 
The value of a pledge would lie in its preventative nature . 
While those people who would give currency to their signature might seem to be those least likely to launch racial epithets at another person , one can never tell . 
The fact that it is not a mandatory agreement also helps . 
Those who would sign a non-mandatory agreement might also be more willing to abide by it . 
The pledge , as <ORGANIZATION>McElveen</ORGANIZATION> envisions it now , would have some other things going for it . 
For one , by implementing it at the end of a first year student 's first semester , it would reinforce the ideals of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community after the first year student has already tasted them . 
For another , this timing would help in not get lost in the shuffle of events that takes place at the beginning of the school year , giving students more time to reflect on it rather than signing it mindlessly or ignoring it completely . 
While adding one more agreement or pledge to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community might seem futile or insignificant , the proposed " pledge against prejudice " holds a different kind of promise . 
As it is non-mandatory , it applies only to those who want to hold themselves accountable . 
In doing so , it may prevent future incidents . 
We can not predict what kind of results the pledge might produce , especially given its preventative purpose , but if it gets people thinking about what comes out of their mouths , then it can be considered a success and a worthwhile program .
