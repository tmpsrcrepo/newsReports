This <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> will pass like any other for most students on Grounds . 
But for a few here in our safe utopia of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> , the date of <DATE>April 9</DATE> carries the stigma of tragedy . 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> will mark the 55th anniversary of a the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian civilians by Jewish terrorist organizations in the small , peaceful town whose name has become synonymous with Israeli terror -- <PERSON>Deir Yassin</PERSON> . 
Although some Israeli organizations still stubbornly persist in grotesquely denying the reality of the massacre , most people throughout the world recognize it for the catastrophe it was , fitting of a day of remembrance , and symbolizing 55 years of shameful Israeli oppression against a weaker , impoverished native population . 
I hope students take a moment on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to soberly reflect on the harsh realities of the Zionist occupation and the damage it has wrought and question why the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> continues to support it . 
Many contemporary histories of the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> conveniently overlook the violence and injustices committed by Zionists , the founders of the state of <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> . 
We do not often hear of " Jewish terrorist " groups -- in fact , the concept sounds strangely oxymoronic to modern ears , so used to hearing one-sided accounts of Palestinian terrorism . 
But as any reader of Israeli history will confirm , Jewish terrorism was indeed a formative element of the founding of <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> . 
As described in <PERSON>David Shapiro</PERSON> 's book , " Arab and Jew , " on the ninth of <DATE>April , 1948</DATE> , the Jewish terrorist groups <PERSON>Etzel</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Lehi</LOCATION> attacked the peaceful village of <PERSON>Deir Yassin</PERSON> and massacred its men , women and children ; sliced off ears , gutted bellies , raped women , torched men , dumped bodies in stone quarries and left with a triumphant parade . 
Although the incident was not unique , it was best documented by representatives from the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> and British police forces , who all witnessed the event . 
News of the event eventually filtered into the international news media and historical record . 
The evidence they provided later forced the Israeli government to rescind its claim that Jews were not the ones responsible at all -- rather , they originally blamed " rogue Arabs . " 
Israeli school textbooks still depict this and many other twisted versions of history , such as denying that many Arab villages ( whose inhabitants still exist as refugees ) ever existed or lionizing Jewish terrorists as " freedom fighters " or claiming that , inexplicably , Palestine 's Arab population fled the country voluntarily in <DATE>1948</DATE> ( in fact , many times in response to massacres like <PERSON>Deir Yassin</PERSON> ) . 
This is the basis upon which the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> 's so-called " only democratic state " was founded . 
Of course , any foreign affairs major can rebut that claim -- both <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> have been thriving , legitimate democracies for over 20 years . 
Interestingly , our media sources dismiss these nations as lacking legitimacy somehow because of their Islamic heritage . 
But what 's wrong with Islamic parties winning elections in <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> being a self-proclaimed Islamic state ? 
After all , <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> -- not , in fact , the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> 's only democracy -- is a self-proclaimed Jewish state , with many privileges granted to its Jewish population that are denied to non-Jews . 
Non-Jewish Israelis are subject to state-sponsored religious , and often racial , discrimination in the areas of leasing land , employment practices and voting , just to name a few . 
Several Nobel laureates and leading ( non-Arab ) international figures have compared the situation in <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> to South African apartheid on account of the striking similarities between the two . 
American policy toward <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> is also grossly skewed . 
Despite a per-capita income of roughly <MONEY>$ 15,000</MONEY> ( more than many European states , and a product of a 50 year history of heavy public and private American investment ) , <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> receives over <MONEY>$ 3 billion</MONEY> in direct <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> foreign aid every year -- more than all <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> aid to the continents of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South America</LOCATION> combined . 
With federal loan guarantees and other direct subsidies , total aid rises approximately <MONEY>$ 5 billion</MONEY> , according to the <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION> . 
Why would stingy Congressmen bathe <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> in so much unneeded subsidy ? 
It could have something to do with <ORGANIZATION>AIPAC</ORGANIZATION> -- <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> 's <MONEY>$ 15 million dollar</MONEY> political lobby in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , second in expenditures only to <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> 's . 
AIPAC is <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 's most feared national lobby , due to multi-million dollar strategic candidate funding and specious lobbying practices that have led to its offices being raided by the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> on several occasions . 
Groups like <ORGANIZATION>AIPAC</ORGANIZATION> also lobby and patronize the American Jewish community , a consistent voting bloc , for candidates they feel serve <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> 's interest . 
Savvy politicians know that support for <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> means major contributions from this well-heeled lobby and their supporters and are only too happy to oblige . 
<PERSON>Deir Yassin</PERSON> is a reminder to us today that the struggle is not over . 
Through shrewd lobbying and political insinuation , <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> has managed to portray itself to many Americans as the victim -- although its continued racist campaign of oppression against the Palestinian people has killed nearly three times as many civilians as vice-versa , according to every major international human rights organization ( <ORGANIZATION>Human Rights Watch</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Amnesty International</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Red Crescent Societies</ORGANIZATION> , among others ) . 
Even if the disgusting Israeli subjugation of the occupied territories is n't enough to convince many that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's policy towards <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> must change , surely <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> does not deserve what amounts to a full third of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's entire foreign aid budget . 
Take time on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to observe the suffering of the majority of the victims in this terrible conflict , who do not have access to a slick <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> lobby or PR office . 
<PERSON>Deir Yassin</PERSON> should remind us that the world will not truly be just until <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> recognizes its wrongs and corrects them and until we see a free Palestine .
