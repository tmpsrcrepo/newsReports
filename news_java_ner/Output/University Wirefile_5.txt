<TIME>Last night</TIME> , about 20 members of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community took part in a lighting tour , an annual event sponsored by <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> that surveys safety problems resulting from deficient lighting around Grounds . 
The purpose of the security ' walk ' is to make sure " there are not just a few people giving judgment , " <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Kirstin Curtis</PERSON> said . 
Participants drove around Grounds for about three hours , checking up on the effectiveness of current lighting and locating blue safety phones . 
This year 's walk took on particular importance as it comes on the heels of a rash of attacks in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> vicinity . 
On <DATE>Sept. 21</DATE> , a female <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student was a victim in the <ORGANIZATION>East University Hall</ORGANIZATION> parking lot . 
Since <DATE>March</DATE> , eight attacks on <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> women have occurred in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> area . 
" This lighting tour is very useful . 
Past history has proven that problem areas can be identified " and dealt with , said <PERSON>Jeff Sitler</PERSON> , an <ORGANIZATION>Environmental Health and Safety</ORGANIZATION> official . 
" It is definitely an ongoing process ... because things change . " 
During the tour , participants noted certain areas that needed extra safety measures . 
Because of their input , the parking lots on <ORGANIZATION>Jefferson Park Avenue</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Brandon Avenue</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Bice House</ORGANIZATION> will receive new emergency phones . 
The lower east lot at <ORGANIZATION>University Hall</ORGANIZATION> also probably will receive a few additional light fixtures . 
The group examined lighting at the entrance to <ORGANIZATION>Kerchoff Hall</ORGANIZATION> and at <ORGANIZATION>McLeod Hall</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Culbreth Lane</PERSON> , where a rape was reported last <DATE>July</DATE> , most likely will receive additional lighting and tree trimming . 
New emergency phones at <ORGANIZATION>Culbreth</ORGANIZATION> should be up and running during the next few days . 
One of the primary reasons for holding the walk each year is the fact that lighting and other safety problems are constantly changing , <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Mike Sheffield</PERSON> said . 
For example , <PERSON>Sheffield</PERSON> said , growing trees often block light . 
" We 're in kind of a constant battle with the people who put them in , " he said . 
Many of the lights on Grounds are historical reproductions costing at least <MONEY>$ 2,000</MONEY> each and another <MONEY>$ 2,000</MONEY> to install . 
Emergency telephones cost about <MONEY>$ 2,500</MONEY> for the phone and the installation . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University Security and Safety Committee</ORGANIZATION> is allowed <MONEY>$ 50,000</MONEY> yearly for improvements . 
" We will develop a list of priorities with the estimated costs and go as far down the list as we can with our <MONEY>$ 50,000</MONEY> , " Committee Chairman <PERSON>Bill Wilkerson</PERSON> said . 
Despite the need for improvements cited on <TIME>last night</TIME> 's tour , <PERSON>Sheffield</PERSON> said , overall the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> does a very good job in meeting students ' safety concerns . 
" When you compare us to other institutions , I think we have a very safe institution , " he said . 
Students attending the walk <TIME>last night</TIME> said it highlighted many key issues regarding safety around Grounds . 
" Safety is definitely an issue we need to be concerned about . 
... I know we 're doing a lot of good by being here , " Student Council College Rep. <PERSON>Katie Russell</PERSON> said . 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Jennifer Alt</PERSON> , who interns with the <ORGANIZATION>University Police Department</ORGANIZATION> , said it is difficult to notice specific safety problems during the day or when with a group of people . 
" I think a lot of times I do n't realize safety issues until I 'm walking by myself , " <PERSON>Alt</PERSON> said .
