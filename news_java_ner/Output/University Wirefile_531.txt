Student Council launched a website <DATE>Friday</DATE> in conjunction with advocacy groups One Less and One in Four titled " Rolling Stone Must Unite Us , Not Divide Us . " 
The site hosts a litany of information for students - about the resources available through the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> for survivors of sexual assault , the policies and legal restraints in place , and ways students can get involved to help combat the prevalence of sexual violence , both by joining advocacy groups and becoming an active bystander . 
The site also offers students a platform to give <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> policy proposals or raise concerns about sexual misconduct on Grounds . 
The site , which was launched <DATE>Friday</DATE> afternoon in an email signed by the leaders of <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> , One Less and One in Four , was spearheaded by <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Jalen Ross</PERSON> , a fourth-year Engineering student , in light of recent allegations of rape and sexual misconduct at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Today , we call on one another to make this University the safe haven it ought to be , " the email said . 
" Take a minute to learn more , to become an advocate , or to voice your opinions . 
Take a moment to tell your story , or to support a survivor with loving strength . " 
<PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said the idea for the website was put in motion <DATE>last Wednesday</DATE> following the release of the Rolling Stone article , which detailed a graphic account of gang rape at a <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity part in <DATE>Sept. 2012</DATE> . 
" We called an emergency executive meeting on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said . 
" What we started with was asking ourselves what our students needed . " 
Once a course of action was decided , <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> led the creation of the website and was involved in both the design and assembly of content . 
Third-year Engineering student <PERSON>Adam Wulchin</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> 's chief technology officer , was also highly involved in the site 's creation . 
Council representatives <PERSON>Blake Calhoun</PERSON> , a fourth-year College student , and second-year <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Catalina Pinto</PERSON> contributed to the site 's content . 
The website itself is composed of eight tabs : I am a Survivor , Show Your Support , Get Involved , Change the Policy , I Know Someone Who Has Been Assaulted , <ORGANIZATION>Hear My Voice</ORGANIZATION> , " Rape Should be an Honor Offense " and What Can I Do . 
The website includes links to the Facebook pages for several organizations active on grounds , including Student Watch , Take Back the <TIME>Night</TIME> , <ORGANIZATION>Green Dot</ORGANIZATION> and the newly-formed Buddies on Call . 
" I think it 's really important for <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> to work with these groups , " said third-year <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> student Faith <PERSON>Lyons</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> director of university relations . 
" We 're really dedicated to helping their efforts and making sure that this conversation continues . " 
<PERSON>Lyons</PERSON> said the website is an important resource for students who did not know where to turn for answers in regard to the current sexual misconduct policy , what is actively happening on Grounds and advocacy and support groups present at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I think having a centralized resource where you can both share your opinion about what 's going on , and also have resources for information , is really important , " <PERSON>Lyons</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said the foremost target audience was students , though other members of the community are welcome to access the website and use it as a resource . 
" There are people who are responding to this who are n't students , and that 's completely OK , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said . 
" If a professor wants to use [ the site ] , they can do the same things that their students can . " 
Under the " Hear My Voice " tab , users can post their thoughts on the current sexual misconduct policy at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , and offer ideas for revisions . 
Once a post is made , other users can then rate it with a neutral response , or one , two or three stars . 
Comments are also welcomed . 
" It 's important to me that we have a way for people to react to this , and get them credible information , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said . 
Though many students have not yet explored the site , first-year <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Sarah Quettawala</PERSON> has accessed the link . 
She said she appreciates the opportunity for all voices at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to be heard in one place . 
" As one student among 23,000 , it is easy for even the loudest voices to go unheard , " <PERSON>Quettawala</PERSON> said . 
" This website is a phenomenal , and necessary , addition to the U.Va . 
community . "
