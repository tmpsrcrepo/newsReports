The <ORGANIZATION>University Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> has found its way back into the spotlight in the past month , following allegations that a hospital employee raped two psychiatric ward patients . 
The bad press and lawsuit filed against the hospital are reminiscent of the <DATE>1998</DATE> baby switch fiasco . 
Many have been quick to criticize the hospital recently , but important changes already have been implemented that should help prevent future incidents . 
In the aftermath of the rape charges , the hospital has taken proper steps to ensure the safety of its patients . 
<PERSON>Rudolph T. Johnson Jr.</PERSON> , the former hospital employee who has been charged with rape , had a felony cocaine conviction . 
The hospital has since fired nine probationary employees convicted of felonies , six of whom filed a lawsuit <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> claiming the firings violated their due process rights . 
The hospital should have examined its employees on a case-by-case basis before deciding to fire anyone . 
Since the initial firings , however , the hospital has rehired three of the employees after reviewing the nature of their past convictions and whether the convictions were disclosed on their employment applications . 
These rehirings indicate a willingness to treat employees fairly and correct an earlier mistake . 
Additionally , the hospital is justified in considering felony convictions in hiring and firing . 
The hospital 's highest priorities must be the safety and service of its patients , and when those are in jeopardy , the hospital is right to take steps to remedy the situation . 
From that perspective , the most troubling aspect of the charges against <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> is that he continued to work at the hospital , and allegedly committed another rape , while he was under investigation for an earlier rape . 
Fortunately , this has prompted the hospital to change its policy so that any employee under investigation for serious misconduct on the job will be reassigned or put on administrative leave . 
Johnson 's case underscores the importance of this change at the hospital . 
It is equally necessary , however , for other <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employees to be subject to the same policy to prevent the situation from repeating itself in a different setting . 
The hospital has implemented changes in other areas needing improvement as well , most noticeably refining its procedures for placing psychiatric patients in restraints . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Health Care Financing Administration</ORGANIZATION> has made these improvements a requirement for the hospital to continue to receive Medicare reimbursements . 
Hospital administrators are confident that the necessary changes have been made . 
The hospital understandably has been criticized since the rape allegations were made public . 
But hospital administrators have been prompt in making the appropriate changes in hiring practices and patient treatment . 
Concern for the well being of patients clearly is a priority in the new policies . 
Although much damage already has been done , the hospital has reacted responsibly in the aftermath of tragedy .
