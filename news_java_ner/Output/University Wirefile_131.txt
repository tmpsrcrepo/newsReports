Insomnia stalked my bed , so I turned on the radio to break up the monotony of sheep-counting . 
3WV was playing my favorite Pink Floyd song : " We do n't need no education , we do n't need no thought control ... Teachers , leave those kids alone ! " 
Of course , the members of Pink Floyd went to British schools in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> , when emotional abuse of the students was considered acceptable , even character-building . 
We Americans , being a more enlightened people , hold such behavior from a teacher to warrant warnings and dismissal . 
After all , we have students who can provide all the emotional abuse their peers may need . 
Under current law , such students perform this service without so much as a reprimand . 
Two state legislatures , however , are preparing to thrust themselves into the social jungles of primary and secondary education . 
Both <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 's and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> 's proposed laws are called " Anti-Bully Bills , " but the details of each reveal sharp differences . 
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> 's legislation recognizes that schools are oriented toward educating , and directs anti-bullying efforts accordingly . 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 's legislation misses the purpose of schools by over-emphasizing the penal aspect of ending bullying . 
No rational person favors having students harass one another . 
Besides the emotional impact on students , such behavior detracts from the learning environment . 
Teachers waste valuable time and energy attempting to arbitrate disputes , and even the students not involved become distracted from their work . 
Moreover , apparently harmless bullying can escalate into physical injury . 
At the same time , parents ought to be teaching bullies that their actions are unacceptable . 
Surely part of rearing a child is instructing her in how to conduct herself with her peers . 
But for whatever reason , parents are either failing to do so , or are unsuccessful , because bullying happens . 
So , as usual , schools have to step in to correct behavior that threatens to derail their work to educate children and produce good citizens . 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 's response is a bill that requires each school district to adopt a policy " prohibiting harassment , intimidation or bullying on or immediately adjacent to school grounds , at any school-sponsored activity , on school-provided transportation or at any official school bus stop . " 
It also demands that schools mandate " consequences and appropriate remedial action for a person who commits an act of harassment , intimidation or bullying . " 
Presumably remedial action consists of some type of punishment along the lines of warnings , demerits or suspension . 
None of these do anything to address the cause of the behavior . 
Instead , the threat of " consequences " is supposed to prevent students from bullying . 
The possible misuse of such a policy is noted in another section , which calls for " consequences and appropriate remedial action for a person found to have falsely accused another as a means of retaliation or as a means of harassment , intimidation or bullying . " 
Want to bully someone ? 
Accuse him of being a bully , and you could make his life as hellish as you 'd like . 
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> 's bill takes a different approach . 
It requires each school district to include a specific policy in the district conduct and discipline code concerning bullying prevention and education . 
To help ensure that districts comply , the legislation also compels districts to submit information about their policies on bullying prevention and education , including information related to the development and implementation of any bullying prevention programs . 
While speaking to the legislature , two high school seniors described their school 's bullying prevention program and said it has reduced the number of violent incidents there , including hazing . 
The emphasis is on building character , not punishing students . 
Seniors participate in a retreat , in which they are taught to put aside their differences , and then teach the younger students ( " Bill targets school bullying , " <ORGANIZATION>Denver Post</ORGANIZATION> , <DATE>Jan. 26</DATE> ) . 
By integrating an anti-bullying policy into students ' education , schools avoid singling out particular kids as " problems . " 
Instead , everyone is expected to work cooperatively and to feel a sense of responsibility for both themselves and their peers . 
Clearly this is a somewhat utopian vision , and additional measures may be necessary . 
The <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> bill would be improved by including guidelines and creating a commission to help schools develop such programs . 
If the state truly is interested in decreasing bullying , it needs to be an active participant in making that happen . 
Legislation directed toward education and prevention may take longer to show results , but the long-term rewards will be much greater . 
Students who have learned from these programs carry that knowledge with them to college and beyond . 
Laws intended to punish , on the other hand , are likely to make students begin chanting , " Teachers , leave those kids alone ! "
