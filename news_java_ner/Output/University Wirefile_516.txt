<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> met <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to discuss the implications of the recent Rolling Stone article on the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's system of student self-governance , and to address potential future attacks on such a system . 
In the wake of a Rolling Stone article describing an alleged gang rape at a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> fraternity and the school 's limited response , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said she had received numerous emails criticizing the honor system and calling for the elimination of the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> . 
She said student self-governance is unusually well-developed at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , and as such , will be a critical issue in upcoming and ongoing examinations of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> culture and policy . 
" I think you do , as a group , uphold the highest values of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said to the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> . 
" The fact that those values get violated does n't mean that they are n't still values , does n't mean that we are hypocritical . 
People fall short of their ideals , but that 's not a reason for abandoning your ideals . " 
Honor Committee Chair <PERSON>Nicholas Hine</PERSON> , a fourth-year College student , said the community 's shortcomings in executing these ideas make the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> all the more vital . 
" We have these ideals , and people always fall short of them , and ... more than anything I think ... we need an <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> , " he said . 
" We will never really get there , but that 's why we must always try . 
We are going to do our best to respond to this article in a way that we hope will show the value of having a student-run <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> . " 
With critics calling for the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> 's dissolution , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said the occurrence of sexual misconduct in the community of trust will likely lead to a re-examination of the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> 's role in passing judgment on student behavior . 
" There are really two schools of thought , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" There 's the one that says we should n't have students make these decisions at all so we should abolish the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> , and then there 's the other one which says the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> is great except it does n't hear about sexual assault . 
You 've got to navigate , somehow , a way in between . " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said she did not have a particular plan to help the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> address future scrutiny - even hostility - but that she wanted to give the group a warning of what might come . 
" I 'm happy to support you in any way I can , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
The only way for the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> or the honor system to be directly , procedurally impacted is by action on the part of the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> , which has received appeals to make such changes . 
However , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> would not consider any such amendments at its meeting this <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> . 
" Right now , the delegation of authority to change honor comes from the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> manual , and they can amend the manual , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" Before they change their manual , they need to have a meeting of the executive committee and the executive committee is not scheduled to meet - that bars them doing anything to the manual on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> . " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said for this reason , and because of support from alumni , she felt it was unlikely changes to the honor system would happen in the near future . 
In the long run , however , she said she is less certain . 
" I have n't heard any kind of ground swell in doing that among <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> members , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" Could the pressure build up on them ? 
Yeah . 
But I think there will also be a counterweighting pressure on the part of alumni who think the honor system is great , so I 'm not necessarily worried about it in the short run . 
It could be an issue in the longer term . " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> also addressed the issue of single sanction as applicable to sexual violence , with some <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> members saying they had heard wide student support for the idea . 
Fourth-year Architecture representative <PERSON>Tyler Pitt</PERSON> said he felt many students think sexual violence should fall under what the community has established as intolerable behaviors . 
" I think one thing we need to think about going forward is whether we 'd like to take a stand in terms of whether or not we should recommend that sexual assault fall under a single sanction , though obviously not adjudicated by us , " <PERSON>Pitt</PERSON> said . 
" In terms of an ideal , if you 're thinking this is a community that does not allow these actions , I think most people would agree that rape and sexual assault would fall under these things that we find intolerable . " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said one of the obstacles to a single sanction is the potential wide variety of sexual assaults which could occur . 
" Sexual misconduct is a whole range of behaviors , all the way from verbal harassment to rape , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" If you have a student who , [ let 's ] say , is cyber stalking and does n't realize that that 's offensive and should n't be done - do you want to expel that student for that , or would a lesser sanction make sense ? " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said there are a number of circumstances where there is an opportunity to educate students and intervene to prevent future sexual assaults - a possibility which could be lost if the single sanction policy were applied to all acts of sexual misconduct . 
For this reason and others , <PERSON>Pat Lampkin</PERSON> , vice president and chief student affairs officer , said the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administration is extending the commenting period for the newly proposed policy changes to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual misconduct policy . 
" Tomorrow , we 'll extend the comment period through the 12th , because we 're getting so much energy about it , which is great , " <PERSON>Lampkin</PERSON> said . 
" The dominant theme right now [ among comments ] is to have expulsion be the mandatory sanction . 
So we will really consider that . 
We 're really looking at all of these . " 
Committee members said many students felt the responses to sexual violence and responses to issues of lying , stealing and cheating are incompatible , and action should be taken to resolve these alleged disparities . 
However , Vice Chair for Investigations <PERSON>Henley Hopkinson</PERSON> , a fourth-year College student , said the student body 's desires may not always align with the desires of survivors . 
" I share your enthusiasm , and I think what we definitely need to keep in mind is that the will of the student body is very important , " <PERSON>Hopkinson</PERSON> said . 
" But the most important issue is the will of the survivor , and the will of the survivor may not always be for there to be a single sanction . " 
To help increase involvement in sexual assault prevention and to sort through potential uncertainties like this , the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> unanimously voted <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to create a yet-unnamed sexual assault subcommittee . 
The subcommittee will help the larger group contribute to the movement against sexual violence at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> is prohibited by federal law from overseeing cases of sexual assault , but <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> members said the body can still contribute to the fight against violence . 
As stated in a <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> letter responding to recent allegations , the group will " strive to support student advocacy across Grounds and further promote discussion about the ideal of honor as it relates to sexual assault . " 
As part of this effort , <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> members and support officers will be trained in violence prevention strategies through <ORGANIZATION>Green Dot</ORGANIZATION> , a new program seeking to reduce sexual misconduct . 
" We acknowledge that the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> can not directly adjudicate the cases at hand , but we will - and must - continue to work with the community towards a safer <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , " the letter read . 
" No matter the constraints of federal legislation or personal feelings about <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> policies , we must remain united in our pursuit of the highest standards of trust , integrity and accountability in our University . " 
Though the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> can not be directly involved with adjudicating sexual assault cases and consequently , can not be involved in the decision of implementing a single sanction system in response to sexual misconduct , <PERSON>Hine</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> would be happy to help the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administration in discussion . 
" Given that Honor has a lot of experience with the single sanction system , we may be in a position to provide some level of guidance in that aspect , " <PERSON>Hine</PERSON> said . 
" If we are asked to assist , then we will definitely answer that call . " 
Correction : A previous version said Pres. <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> met with the " Executive Board " of the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> . 
She met with the full 27-person <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> .
