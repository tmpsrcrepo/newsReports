<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily The <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> unanimously passed a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault during an emergency session held <DATE>Nov. 25</DATE> in response to the Rolling Stone article detailing the gang rape of a then-first-year student <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> at a party at <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity . 
Board member <PERSON>Helen Dragas</PERSON> proposed the zero-tolerance policy .

Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> have the authority under the <ORGANIZATION>Board Manual</ORGANIZATION> to impose appropriate penalties , including expulsion . 
" I think the tone at the top is critical and all leaders need to commit to zero-tolerance , " <PERSON>Dragas</PERSON> said . 
" We need every student and every staff and faculty member to embrace a mindset of zero-tolerance . 
And students need to feel <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> supported when they come forward . " 
A committee of students , <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> members , legal counsel and administrators will meet in the coming weeks to compile policy recommendations for next semester .
