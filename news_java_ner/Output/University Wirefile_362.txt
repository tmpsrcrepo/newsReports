The <ORGANIZATION>Rutherford Institute</ORGANIZATION> , a civil-liberties advocacy group based in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , has championed its share of causes since current president <PERSON>John Whitehead</PERSON> founded the organization in <DATE>1982</DATE> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION> helped <ORGANIZATION>Paula Jones</ORGANIZATION> pursue a sexual-harassment suit against then-President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> in <DATE>1997</DATE> . 
And in <DATE>1993</DATE> , Whitehead-an uncompromising religious-freedom advocate , at least in his earlier days-considered representing <PERSON>David Koresh</PERSON> when the self-proclaimed prophet was holed up in his Branch Davidian compound outside of <LOCATION>Waco</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> . 
Last <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION> threw its weight behind a cause more popular than a cult leader 's religious liberty . 
In a letter to <PERSON>J. Neal Insley</PERSON> , the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Whitehead</PERSON> called for changes to <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> officer training . 
He also suggested the creation of a review board to provide feedback to the public-safety agency . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Virginia ABC</ORGANIZATION> is none too popular in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> after the <DATE>April</DATE> incident involving <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Elizabeth Daly</PERSON> , then a second-year College student . 
ABC operatives swarmed <PERSON>Daly</PERSON> 's car in a darkened grocery store parking lot after the agents mistook a case of sparkling water for beer . 
One of the agents drew his gun . 
Fearing foul play , <PERSON>Daly</PERSON> drove out of the parking lot and promptly called 911 . 
Daly , who said she had never consumed alcohol , was charged with two felonies and spent a night in jail . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION> is right to press the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> to give , in <LOCATION>Whitehead</LOCATION> 's words , a " public accounting . " 
But there are a few ways in which the <ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION> 's pressure threatens to become misplaced . 
Whitehead has suggested a review board that would give feedback to the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> on " necessary reform measures . " 
Some reform measures are probably necessary in the case of the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> . 
But an event that goes wrong , such as the Daly case , does not always indicate a need for policy reform on the organization 's part . 
The <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> has already introduced one significant policy change in response to blowback : at least one uniformed agent is now required to be present when plainclothes agents approach people suspected of breaking the law . 
But it is not a given that further reforms are needed . 
It is smart for organizations to review their policies after an incident that causes a crisis of legitimacy . 
But it is not smart to demand policy changes just for the sake of change , as a show of concern or a public indicator that an organization is engaging in introspection . 
The <PERSON>Daly</PERSON> incident does not seem to have been first and foremost a problem of flawed policy . 
The officers ' undue aggression hints at a problem of implementation . 
Whitehead 's treatment of the constitutional issues the Daly incident raises also does not attend to the limits of policy . 
In his letter , <ORGANIZATION>Whitehead</ORGANIZATION> proposes a training program for agents that would give them a thorough understanding of the <ORGANIZATION>Fourth Amendment</ORGANIZATION> 's prohibitions on unreasonable searches and seizures . 
In keeping with the <ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION> 's libertarian tendencies , <LOCATION>Whitehead</LOCATION> bristled at the <PERSON>Daly</PERSON> incident , branding it a marker of " police militarization , " according to a <DATE>July 1</DATE> press release on the <ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION> 's website . 
( Indeed , some staunch civil-liberties advocates may protest the prohibition of underage drinking altogether , arguing that it violates personal autonomy . ) 
But we should not assume that <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> agents swarmed <PERSON>Daly</PERSON> 's car because they were ignorant of the <ORGANIZATION>Fourth Amendment</ORGANIZATION> . 
As police officers responsible for upholding the law , one would assume that they would be aware of it . 
Further , the " reasonable suspicion " standard the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> employs - which Whitehead argues is unconstitutional - was upheld by <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Terry v. Ohio</LOCATION> . 
ABC agents did not stop <PERSON>Elizabeth Daly</PERSON> because they were unfamiliar with the Constitution ( though they probably would benefit from a brush-up ) . 
The overriding problem here is not incomprehension of the law . 
The problem is a lack of courtesy , at best ; at worst , it is corruption by power . 
Constitutional training will not solve this problem . 
Tightened performance reviews and increased accountability standards for officers might . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Virginia State Police</ORGANIZATION> is conducting a review of the <PERSON>Daly</PERSON> incident that it will share with the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> . 
But the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia State Police</ORGANIZATION> will not offer recommendations to the agency . 
Here is where the <ORGANIZATION>Institute</ORGANIZATION> 's pressure could prove useful . 
Though in his letter <LOCATION>Whitehead</LOCATION> disparages the state police 's review as " little more than a fact-finding mission , " such a mission is important . 
We can not propose informed policy changes unless we know why the agents behaved the way they did that night in <DATE>April</DATE> . 
It would be ideal for the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia State Police</ORGANIZATION> to offer recommendations for change , but if not , <LOCATION>Whitehead</LOCATION> 's idea of a review board could be a good bet . 
We suggest a further source for the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> to consult if it reviews its policies ( which it should ) : the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> police . 
Skilled at dealing with college students , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> police aims to address drinking in a way that holds student safety as its highest aim . 
This mode of law enforcement is something the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> could learn from .
