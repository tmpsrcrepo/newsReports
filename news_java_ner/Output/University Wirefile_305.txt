MANY YOUNG women today grow weary of their chronic victim status , constantly told to be on guard against the ubiquitous male predator . 
These women believe the world is theirs to conquer , and indeed they should . 
Sexism , they respond , is a thing of the past . 
Although they occupy the same space , women and men still live in vastly different worlds . 
Women will forever be relegated to second-class status until they aggressively demand not only sex equity but a safer society in which to live . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> needs to commit itself to enforcing a much stricter policy towards those found guilty of sexual harassment andassault . 
I had not learned what it meant to be a woman until this past <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> . 
Upon learning that our car had been towed after an evening on the Downtown Mall , four young women and I went to retrieve our vehicle . 
On the way , a group of men got out of their trucks and started urinating and whistling at us as we walked by . 
When we reached the towing company , the only sign of life was a distant light behind a wire fence . 
No one was there to meet these young women at <TIME>midnight</TIME> on a dimly lit side street . 
The man at <ORGANIZATION>Collier</ORGANIZATION> 's Towing , and even the policeman whom we flagged down , shrugged off our fear and outrage . 
According to the tower , nothing was going to happen to a group of women . 
Let 's ignore the possibility of an armed man , or even the reality that one strong man could easily overwhelm a group of young women . 
The most frightening thought was the possibility that the 5 ' 3 " owner of the car could easily have been alone . 
A woman waiting alone for fifteen minutes on a dark side street is an invitation for unspeakable horror . 
The hellish <TIME>night</TIME> did n't end there . 
In then less than quarter mile stretch from the Dovecote apartment complex to Chancellor Street , I was subjected to suggestive , vile comments four separate times by men . 
Is this the type of community the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> settles for ? 
Just because there have not been recent reports of assault in no way means they do not occur every single night . 
Some men seem to believe they have a right to verbally assault women . 
They say it 's harmless , that it 's a way of showing an appreciation for a woman 's beauty . 
But there is nothing harmless about darkanonymous encounters on a street . 
There 's nothing worse than the feeling when a man undresses you with his eyes . 
All women know that look . 
This world , even our beloved <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , still suffers from the tyranny of misogyny . 
According to a study done by the Women 's Center , 58 University women were sexually assaulted or raped in <DATE>2005</DATE> . 
One shudders to think of the countless women who never report these crimes , out of shame or denial . 
And what 's more frustrating is that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> does little to show it cares . 
In <DATE>2004</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> openly admitted that no one found guilty of sexual assault had been expelled or even suspended from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
This seems bizarre when contrasted with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's much-lauded Honor Code . 
Apparently lying or cheating is forbidden , but sexual assault can be smoothed over with a slap on the wrist . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> needs to enforce a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault . 
Already the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> does a decent job of educating first-years about sexual assault awareness with a mandatory program sponsored by One in Four . 
But there needs to be a corresponding penalty for those students found guilty , one as severe as that levied against students who lie . 
Anything less is a message to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> women that assault really is n't that big of a deal . 
A student who cheats deserves to be expelled from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> because he has violated our community of trust . 
Does n't a student who sexually assaults another do the exact same thing ? 
<PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Coordinator</ORGANIZATION> of the Women 's Center , says that the greatest issue is not punishment but the " standard of evidence " required to convict . 
Federal policy states that only a " preponderance of evidence " is necessary , but <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> continues to need evidence " beyond a reasonable doubt " . 
With such a tough standard of evidence necessary for events that often occur in the shadows of fraternities , this discourages women from filing a case . 
In addition to a tougher punishment policy on sexual assault , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> needs to better educate its students about what constitutes harassment . 
Most students know rape is wrong , but some young men may not know where to draw the line about verbal harassment . 
A town is only outraged when one of their own women is raped or found dead in a trash bin . 
People need to have more outrage , more resolve to see greater security enforced , without the compelling reminder of the danger faced by women in the form of a mangled , lifeless body .
