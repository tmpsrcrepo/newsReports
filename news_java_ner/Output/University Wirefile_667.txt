" This is the first time having events planned for International Women 's Month , " <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> said . 
" It was really important for me to make sure that the students were involved and that we had for our signature lectureship someone who students could relate to and someone who was doing phenomenal work around education and health which is one of the requirements of the lectureship . " 
President of <ORGANIZATION>University Democrats Porter Koolman</ORGANIZATION> , a third-year College student , said UDems will also honor <ORGANIZATION>Women 's History Month</ORGANIZATION> . 
He said the group will be co-sponsoring an event inviting discussion of the rights women possess over their bodies concerning abortion and contraceptives , sexual assault , gun rights and domestic equality . 
Koolman said he hopes the event will draw greater attention to current issues facing women in society , such as the wage gap between male and female workers . " 
[ Wage inequality is ] critical , and I 'd say along with marriage equality it 's one of the biggest human rights issues of this generation , and it 's one which is so multi-faceted , " <PERSON>Koolman</PERSON> said . 
" It 's in the workforce , it 's on college campuses , it 's evident when a mother has to decide if she wants to give up her career to raise her children . " 
The origins of <ORGANIZATION>Women 's History Month</ORGANIZATION> date back to <DATE>1981</DATE> , when <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> authorized and pushed for the president to designate a " Women 's History Week " during the week of <DATE>Mar. 7 , 1982</DATE> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>National Women</ORGANIZATION> 's History project petitioned <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> for a full <ORGANIZATION>Women 's History Month</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1987</DATE> . 
Koolman said recognizing <DATE>March</DATE> as <ORGANIZATION>Women 's History Month</ORGANIZATION> was important , as women 's history should be part of an ongoing conversation throughout the year . 
" It 's not an issue to highlight for one month and forget about , " he said .
