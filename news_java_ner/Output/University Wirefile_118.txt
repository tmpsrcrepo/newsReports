The recent arrests of two <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> rape suspects and a rape conviction in <DATE>April</DATE> were made possible by DNA evidence alone . 
The <DATE>Aug. 26 , 1999</DATE> rape of a female <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> student in her 17th Street home still haunts the minds of many <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students . 
While she was raped , her male friend was forced to remain in the room . 
Commonwealth Attorney <PERSON>Dave Chapman</PERSON> , who successfully prosecuted the attacker , <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> resident <PERSON>Montaret Davis</PERSON> , described DNA evidence as " indispensable " in this case " because neither victim was able to identify the perpetrator and he was only located on DNA evidence . " 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> left traces of his DNA on the victim 's bed sheets as well as on a can of beer , which he drank while talking to the victim after the rape . 
Charlottesville Police Lt. <PERSON>Chip Harding</PERSON> , who fed the samples from the rape into the state 's DNA databank , described the day he learned <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> was a genetic match as " the most exciting moment in my 23-year career because I had gotten to know the victim and her family . 
" Without DNA [ <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> ] would be back on the streets in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , probably as a sexual predator , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said , stressing the essential nature of the scientific evidence in prosecuting the case . 
The investigation 's history prior to the match shows the importance of DNA in bringing the case to a close . 
" We had a suspect list of probably 40 people that had a history [ as sex offenders ] and <PERSON>Montaret Davis</PERSON> never made our list , so we never would 've focused on him , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
With the DNA identification , police were able to charge <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> with the rape on <DATE>Oct. 5 , 1999</DATE> . 
Following an emotional , week-long trial <DATE>last April</DATE> , a jury found <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> guilty of rape , robbery , forcible sodomy , forcible object sexual penetration and two counts of abduction . 
The jury recommended a sentence of 90 years in prison . 
But DNA technology can not help police nab a suspect if no victim comes forward . 
Harding stressed the importance of the victim cooperating in the case . 
" I really admire her for coming forward , " he said . 
" She should be viewed by U.Va . 
students as a hero . " 
In addition to the <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> conviction , <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Michael Sheffield</PERSON> said he attributes the <DATE>Aug. 28</DATE> arrest of <PERSON>Shannon Leo Malnowski</PERSON> for two rapes and an attempted rape to the identification power of DNA . 
Malnowski is currently being held on two counts of rape and forcible sodomy . 
He is charged with a <DATE>July 28</DATE> rape of a local woman at the <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville High School</ORGANIZATION> track , a <DATE>July 24 , 1997</DATE> rape of a 78-year-old woman on <ORGANIZATION>Culbreth Road</ORGANIZATION> and a <DATE>Nov. 30 , 1996</DATE> attack of a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student on <ORGANIZATION>Cemetery Drive</ORGANIZATION> . 
Malnowski also is charged with indecent exposure from a <DATE>June 16</DATE> incident that took place outside <PERSON>Ruffner Hall</PERSON> . 
In all three cases , victims were walking or jogging in the <TIME>early morning</TIME> and attacked from behind . 
The police were able to collect DNA evidence from each of the assaults but were unable to identify an assailant until the <DATE>June 16</DATE> incident . 
There they retrieved DNA from a T-shirt left at the scene and had an eyewitness identification of the perpetrator . 
" We had a suspect [ in the indecent exposure case ] , which was good . 
We submitted the DNA evidence to the lab and we got a hit , " <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON>J.W.</PERSON> " Buddy " <PERSON>Rittenhouse</PERSON> said . 
" It was just absolutely the one thing we needed to connect all three cases " and charge <PERSON>Malnowski</PERSON> with the rapes , <PERSON>Rittenhouse</PERSON> said . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police Det.</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Kim Pugh</PERSON> also said DNA was " the most important evidence in that case . " 
" We had no idea who the perpetrators were in the '96 and '97 cases and DNA is what gave us the name , " <PERSON>Pugh</PERSON> said . 
In a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student rape case police once considered unsolvable , DNA led police all the way back to <DATE>1977</DATE> when a man was convicted of murder in <LOCATION>Sussex County</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Calvin Lorenzo Perry</PERSON> went to prison in <DATE>1977</DATE> for a <LOCATION>Sussex County</LOCATION> shooting that left one woman dead from a gunshot wound under her ear . 
Perry was paroled in <DATE>1991</DATE> and returned to jail in <DATE>December 1993</DATE> after pleading guilty to a <DATE>May 1993</DATE> theft of a <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> lawn care store on <ORGANIZATION>Garrett Street</ORGANIZATION> . 
During his time in prison , officials took a DNA sample and put in the state-wide databank . 
Perry 's DNA sample matched DNA samples from a <DATE>1993</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student rape case , when a female <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student was raped near Lambeth Field Apartments on <DATE>April 16 , 1993</DATE> . 
Her knife-wielding assailant grabbed her in the <ORGANIZATION>University Hall</ORGANIZATION> parking lot and dragged her across Emmet Street where he then raped her . 
The case stalled for years , but when the DNA samples matched , police reopened the seven-year-old rape case and pointed to <PERSON>Perry</PERSON> as the alleged attacker . 
Police were not able to identify a suspect in the rape until a " cold hit " was found in the databank . 
Asst. Commonwealth Attorney <PERSON>Ronald M. Huber</PERSON> , who declined to comment on the specifics of the case , said some cases " just go unsolved [ without DNA evidence ] , so there 's not even an arrest unless there 's a hit " in the databank .
