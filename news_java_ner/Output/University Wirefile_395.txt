Recently , The Cavalier Daily published an editorial discussing President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's task force on college sexual assault , which he announced almost two weeks ago . 
The editorial argues that in order to address the roots of sexual misconduct , we need to focus on its complex causes , not just the appropriate methods of response . 
While the editorial offers a fair critique of the task force 's strengths and limitations , I suggest the solution is nearer to us than the managing board suspects . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's upcoming national conference on sexual misconduct exemplifies a new standard of dialogue on this complex issue . 
The goals of <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's task force include providing colleges with practices for preventing and responding to sexual assault , as well as making sure these institutions fulfill their legal obligations . 
Other objectives include raising the level of federal transparency in these matters and fostering teamwork among federal agencies addressing campus sexual violence . 
But sexual misconduct is a complex , emotionally charged issue ; its causes and effects expand beyond perpetrators and victims . 
We have to do more than ensure that <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> officials and law enforcement are responding to sexual misconduct in a proper manner ; we must also examine the social and cultural features of the college environment that make sexual assault such a widespread problem . 
Months before <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's task force was announced , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> and Vice President for Student Affairs Pat <PERSON>Lampkin</PERSON> began planning a national conference focused on sexual assault on college campuses : " Dialogue at U.Va. : Sexual Misconduct Among College Students " will take place in <DATE>mid-February</DATE> . 
It will include more than 200 legal specialists , student affairs professionals , student leaders and college presidents , among others . 
The goal of the conference , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> wrote on the its website , is to " launch a national discussion among higher education communities on the complexities surrounding sexual misconduct among college students " using a " multifaceted lens , including individual , cultural , social , and legal perspectives . " 
The conference promises to address the problem of campus sexual assault with the kind of multidisciplinary approach the managing board called for in its editorial . 
An array of experts - including lawyers , administrators , psychiatrists , anthropologists and artists - will introduce different viewpoints into one conference . 
This enables participants not only to think more holistically about the aftermath of sexual misconduct but to uncover the psychological and sociocultural factors that make a college community vulnerable to sexual assault . 
But such efforts must not limit themselves to dry academic or legal exercises . 
To be effective , they must engage multiple levels of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community - students as well as professors and administrators . 
The conference will accomplish this goal in an unprecedented manner and encourage college presidents to take more responsibility for the sexual misconduct that occurs on campuses across the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Its " Panel of Presidents " will include the presidents of <ORGANIZATION>Amherst College , University of California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Dartmouth College</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>the University of North Carolina</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Chapel Hill</LOCATION> , to name a few . 
Such high-profile figures speaking on the issue at the same conference as the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's own student leaders encourages a more open and productive exchange . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> says she believes college presidents should lead the way in reforming campus social norms surrounding sexual misconduct . 
Her insistence is striking given recent criticism over the way colleges and universities handle sexual assault . 
In the <DATE>last three years</DATE> , several high-profile universities have faced accusations that their officials have tried to cover up sexual misconduct at the schools . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's conference moves to restore some of this damaged trust . 
Sexual misconduct is often shrouded in stigma . 
Campus sex crimes - which often degenerate into questions of " he said , she said " - are especially difficult to prevent , address and litigate . 
The upcoming conference offers a new legitimacy to sexual crimes . 
The event 's scope demonstrates that higher-education leaders across the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> take campus sexual assault seriously . 
While sexual misconduct is by no means a new issue in college communities , the quality and degree of acknowledgement is unprecedented . 
The conference promises to be more than a symbolic act . 
It seems poised to raise the standards for how students and administrators discuss campus sexual assault .
