<PERSON>Elizabeth Armstrong</PERSON> , a sociologist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> , spoke at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> about the problem of campus sexual assault and what universities can do to help address the issue . 
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> 's talk - titled " Beyond Rape Culture : Organizational Approaches to Sexual Assault on Campus " - followed an introduction by <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> and focused on concrete solutions universities can implement at the institutional level . 
Rape culture is a term that refers to a social climate in which sexualized violence is normalized and male sexual aggression towards women is encouraged , according to the rape crisis center <ORGANIZATION>Women Against Violence Against Women</ORGANIZATION> . 
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said the way we talk about rape culture is leading us to ignore real changes we can make to solve the problem . 
" The bottom line is really to look at what universities as organizations can do to reduce ... sexual assault , " <PERSON>Armstrong</PERSON> said . " 
[ We need to start ] moving beyond only changing beliefs in individual people 's heads and start thinking in a more systematic way . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said a big part of this is reducing opportunities for sexual violence . 
" There are certain contexts that actually just provide opportunities to rape , " <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" They make it easy for predators to find victims and they make it really hard for them to get caught . 
They can create group or mob mentalities that encourage people who would n't normally rape to do so . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said a common type of campus sexual violence is what she calls " party rape , " which she said often take place in the male-dominated environments . " 
[ These ] events are usually male-controlled or out-of-control - people do n't know each other , want to fit in and are drinking , " she said . 
" Inexperienced first year women attend parties organized by older male students , [ where they ] defer to men and strive for male approval . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said victims of party rape are often young women new to campus and assailants are often " in-network strangers " - individuals who know people within the victim 's circle , but to whom the victim has not been introduced . 
" In this particular kind of assault , [ women ] are at risk from people who seem like someone they would trust , but may not in fact be someone they knew before that evening , " <PERSON>Armstrong</PERSON> said . 
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said at these parties , men control the alcohol and entry to the party , often enforcing gender ratios or setting sexualized themes . " 
[ These ] parties often [ have ] a male dominant , female submissive theme to them , [ like ] ' CEO and Secretary Ho , ' " <PERSON>Armstrong</PERSON> said . " 
[ Men are ] trying to get the women to come to the party in as little clothes as possible . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> says change is often resisted because a social scene that revolves around partying is fun and is part of the " college experience . " 
However , party rape is a form of sexual violence amenable to organizational solutions . 
Armstrong suggested creating alternative social spaces for students and better late night transportation to cut down on opportunities for sexual assault to occur . 
Increasing diversity would also be beneficial , she said . 
" A lot of these social scenes are scenes that are very white and very wealthy , " <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" If you have more a diverse campus with more integration , I think you can kind of push back against these particularly dangerous contexts . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> 's lecture was part of a series of talks called the <ORGANIZATION>Intimacy Lectures</ORGANIZATION> , an interdisciplinary effort at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to address different types of intimacy from different perspectives . 
Sociology Prof. <PERSON>Allison Pugh</PERSON> organized the lectures with three other professors at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . " 
[ The Intimacy Lectures ] got started because I and my co-organizers all shared a view or a hope that U.Va . 
could become an important place for the latest conversations that are happening about intimacy , " <PERSON>Pugh</PERSON> said . 
The organizers reached out to <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> because of her expertise . 
" Elizabeth is really a strong scholar on intimacy issues , " <PERSON>Pugh</PERSON> said . 
" She 's the preeminent scholar on sexual assault on campuses , and we really wanted to have at least one person talking about those issues.I wanted us to think seriously about intimacy from a number of different perspectives , including its dark side . " 
Media Studies and Sociology Prof. <PERSON>Andrea Press</PERSON> , another organizer of the lecture series , said she thought <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> 's lecture would bring something new to the discussion of intimacy . 
" She 's one of the few people who has years of study under her belt in this topic , and we have a crying need for more data and more info grounded in research in this topic , " Press said . 
The Intimacy Lectures will continue through <DATE>December 2015</DATE> .
