The story of an 18-year-old unwed mother from <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , one of the thousands of Virginians to be involuntarily sterilized , is about to come to <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's attention . 
Last <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Historic Resources</ORGANIZATION> approved a highway marker remembering the <ORGANIZATION>1927 Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> case that upheld <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's state law legalizing sterilization . 
The marker will memorialize the <ORGANIZATION>Buck v. Bell Case</ORGANIZATION> , as well as <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> native <PERSON>Carrie Buck</PERSON> , who was the first person sterilized under the law . 
It will be placed on the property of a <ORGANIZATION>Region Ten Community Services Board</ORGANIZATION> located on <LOCATION>Preston Avenue</LOCATION> . 
The exact location will be determined by the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION> . 
" <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's highway marker program has been providing history lessons to the traveling public along <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's scenic roadways , " Secretary of <ORGANIZATION>Natural Resources W. Tayloe Murphy Jr.</ORGANIZATION> said . 
<PERSON>Paul A. Lombardo</PERSON> , director of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's program in law and medicine at the center for biomedical ethics , aided <PERSON>Murphy</PERSON> in the project and is the marker 's sponsor . 
<PERSON>Lombardo</PERSON> will give a lecture " Eugenics in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> : from <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> , " <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in <PERSON>Clark</PERSON> 147 . 
Eugenics testing , now known for its fraudulence and prejudice , once was considered the chief scientific method for evaluating people 's intelligence . 
In <DATE>1924</DATE> , the state passed a law that permitted involuntary sterilization for those considered " feeble-minded . " 
That same year , Buck , an 18-year-old rape victim in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> became pregnant and was committed involuntarily to a state facility near <LOCATION>Lynchburg</LOCATION> . 
Buck , like most of the 8,300 Virginians sterilized since <DATE>1924</DATE> , was a lower class worker who garnered suspicion for a " feeble mind and social inadequacy , " <PERSON>Lombardo</PERSON> said . 
" Since so-called problems like hers were considered hereditary , there was a fear that her progeny would be peculiar or abnormal , " <PERSON>Lombardo</PERSON> added . 
When Buck was recommended for sterilization , <ORGANIZATION>the Circuit Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> agreed , and <ORGANIZATION>Buck</ORGANIZATION> 's lawyer appealed the case to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <DATE>1927</DATE> case of <ORGANIZATION>Buck v. Bell</ORGANIZATION> was passed by a vote of eight to one , with Justice <PERSON>Oliver Wendell Holmes</PERSON> presiding . 
Holmes , accepting the eugenical arguments regarding genetic inferiority , stated " three generations of imbeciles are enough . " 
About 60,000 Americans have been sterilized , <PERSON>Lombardo</PERSON> said . 
Buck died in <DATE>1983</DATE> . 
Subsequent research has shown that Buck had no hereditary defects . 
In addition , the <ORGANIZATION>House of Delegates</ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution two months ago to have the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> honor the memory of Buck on <DATE>May 2</DATE> , which marks the 75th anniversary of <ORGANIZATION>Buck v. Bell</ORGANIZATION> .
