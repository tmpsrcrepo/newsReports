This past <DATE>Sunday</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition</ORGANIZATION> ( formerly known as the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Leadership Council</ORGANIZATION> ) hosted a Peer Education and <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Violence Prevention Summit</ORGANIZATION> . 
Attendees included representatives from the SVPC member organizations ( <ORGANIZATION>Peer Health Educators</ORGANIZATION> , Alcohol and Drug Abuse and Prevention Team , One Less , One in Four , and Feminism is For Everyone ) , and student leaders from across Grounds . 
This summit was the first of its kind , and facilitated an honest conversation about Sexual Violence and Misconduct , an issue that has recently erupted onto the national stage but has been a problem on our Grounds for many years . 
Our member organizations have long been dedicated to educating the student body about the prevalence and preventability of Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct , but we saw this summit as the chance to unify our diverse efforts into a coordinated one . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Federal Government</ORGANIZATION> , States , and Universities across the country have all joined together in an attempt to push Sexual Violence prevention to the forefront of campus life , and to eliminate an unacceptable danger to students . 
The message is clear : the time for us to act is now . 
This summit was a chance to combine student self-governance with effective , immediate , and widespread Sexual Violence Prevention . 
With directives coming to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> every day , our ability to maintain <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students ' connection with this issue is paramount . 
This issue affects everyone , and eliminating it from our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will only be possible through increased cooperation while maintaining a strong line of communication between administration and students . 
In this vein , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has been working closely with students to unveil the " Not On Our Grounds " initiative , featuring the #HoosGotYourBack Campaign , a joint effort of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , Corner merchants , and representatives from the student body . 
#HoosGotYourBack emphasizes that everyone has a role in sexual violence prevention , whether that is through being an active bystander , working to educate peers , or promoting a culture of mutual respect and trust . 
It is our hope that the student body will grab hold of this mission and truly make it their own , keeping the top down and bottom up processes fluid . 
As a coalition , we will work to fulfill the mission and vision we set for ourselves this past <DATE>Sunday</DATE> . 
We hope to unite peer education groups , effectively publicize the resources available to survivors , and present cohesive messaging to the student body . 
We will also begin the process of evaluating our peer-education groups to quantify and improve our work as needed to best serve our fellow students . 
We want to cultivate an institutional memory , a bank of sustainable resources that can and will be utilized by the new wave of activists who are constantly stepping up to help . 
As a peer advocacy community and a student body we will continue to support survivors and let their voices be heard , a commitment which we have never and will never waiver from . 
We hope this piece facilitates an ongoing dialogue about sexual violence that sparks cultural change , rather than one that starts and ends in <DATE>April</DATE> when survivors share their stories at Take Back the <TIME>Night</TIME> . 
As we move forward with this work , we acknowledge that <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> traditions and prevention efforts can sometimes come into conflict . 
At the student summit , many constituents expressed that the language " Community of Trust " can be alienating because of its association with the <ORGANIZATION>Honor System</ORGANIZATION> , which has a perceived history of representing whiteness , the Greek system and wealth . 
Sexual assault cuts across racial , socio-economic , age , geographic and social-affiliation lines , and so it deserves to be treated as a community issue . 
Thus , it is time for us to rethink the meaning of " community " in community of trust . 
Being in a community means accepting the responsibility that we , as individuals , can look out for one another , and we , as a community , can help to end violence . 
Our community deserves more from each of us , and from itself . 
A refocused eye on prevention can be a chance to reclaim and restructure the meaning of community . 
Sexual assault prevention is something that we must all work together on to solve . 
Now is the time to step up and come together to show our support for survivors and to prevent potential assaults .
