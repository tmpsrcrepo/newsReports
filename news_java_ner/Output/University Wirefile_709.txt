Batten Hour featured a talk about safer Grounds <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> which focused on allowing students to feel more comfortable around Grounds and the barriers female students and faculty face due to safety concerns . 
Public Policy Prof. <PERSON>Sophie Trawalter</PERSON> and Prof. <PERSON>Jennifer Doleac</PERSON> said women are underrepresented in academia , especially in STEM fields . 
Trawalter said this gender gap may be attributed to a hostile environment on Grounds . 
" Concerns about safety explain the gender differences ... at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Trawalter</PERSON> said . 
" The claim that we 're testing is whether concerns about safety undermine women 's engagement at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , and the preliminary data suggests that [ they do ] . " 
To determine how women feel about safety on Grounds , <PERSON>Trawalter</PERSON> and <PERSON>Doleac</PERSON> conducted a survey in which they collected data from students , faculty and post-doctoral students at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
According to the survey , most female students said they are concerned about their safety on Grounds at times , while most men say they are never concerned about their safety . 
Women also said <ORGANIZATION>Grounds</ORGANIZATION> is too dark at night and they would be more likely to stay late at the library if Grounds were better lit . 
Female faculty also responded they are sometimes concerned about safety , while most male faculty reported they are never concerned with safety on Grounds . 
Trawalter said physical safety is an issue , especially for women . 
She said women are less likely to use public spaces and work spaces at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> and are less likely to feel at home due such concern . 
" What 's become clear to us is that for every woman that we talk to , [ safety is ] just intuitive - like , of course [ they ] think about this , " <PERSON>Trawalter</PERSON> said . 
Trawalter and <PERSON>Doleac</PERSON> said they began collecting data to gage how safe females feel at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and the factors that make them feel more or less safe . " 
[ The ] goal here is to try to find data that corroborate the [ reported feelings of safety ] to some degree , " <PERSON>Doleac</PERSON> said . 
Trawalter and <PERSON>Doleac</PERSON> 's research team worked with <ORGANIZATION>University Housing and Residence Life , Facilities Management</ORGANIZATION> and the Office of the Architect to study lighting around Grounds and observed very low light levels in most locations . 
Trawalter and <PERSON>Doleac</PERSON> also studied how events triggering safety concerns impact women 's engagement at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , such as the <DATE>September 2014</DATE> disappearance of second-year <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> . 
The study 's preliminary data showed a decrease in the probability of women swiping in to facilities after <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> during the period when <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> was considered missing . 
Data also showed female students are more likely to avoid enrolling in classes which begin or end at night , that and female faculty are less likely to teach classes at night . 
" Women seem to not be able to disengage from [ the <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> ] story , " <PERSON>Trawalter</PERSON> said . 
Trawalter also stressed the importance of safety research . 
" I think there 's something important about doing this kind of work at <LOCATION>U.Va</LOCATION> . 
now when women are particularly concerned about safety , " <PERSON>Trawalter</PERSON> said . 
Doleac emphasized the difference between safety research and sexual assault research . 
" There really is n't any other research on this , " <PERSON>Doleac</PERSON> said . 
" Research on sexual assault is trying to describe the current problem and typically uses survey responses . 
[ We 're ] trying to find better data to test the impact of different [ initiatives ] that will not only make women feel safer on university campuses but that will actually make them safer . "
