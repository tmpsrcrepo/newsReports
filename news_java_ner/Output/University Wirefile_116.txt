The emergence of DNA evidence as an integral component in rape cases has revolutionized the justice system . 
DNA evidence has changed both the way police conduct investigations and how prosecutors and defense attorneys interpret and use evidence in a trial against an alleged offender , police say . 
<ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Police Detective Kim Pugh</ORGANIZATION> describes DNA technology as " the greatest advancement in law enforcement since fingerprinting . " 
Detectives can use DNA to genetically match evidence collected at crime scenes with suspects , changing the face of law enforcement . 
The increased use of DNA profiling has changed the way regular street cops , who usually arrive first on the scene , handle evidence , because every item a suspect may have come in contact with has become even more important . 
" The initial officers value more now the importance of collecting evidence . 
Cigarettes , beer cans , clothing ... officers look more for those types of evidence than in years past , " <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Michael Sheffield</PERSON> said . 
" On a day-to-day basis they are aware that [ those ] may be the critical piece of evidence you are looking for in a case . " 
Charlottesville Police Chief <PERSON>J.W.</PERSON> " Buddy " Rittenhouse reflected on his lengthy career and said that 35 years ago " there was a lot of solid police work , but we did not have the advantage of physical evidence . " 
Before the advent of DNA profiling , police had to rely mainly on eyewitnesses , fingerprints and interrogations of suspects in investigating crime . 
These factors still have a great deal of investigative importance , but they require having a suspect to make them most effective . 
DNA enables police to investigate crimes when there is not a clear suspect , as has often been the case in recent years . 
" DNA has revolutionized how we investigate crimes today , " <PERSON>Rittenhouse</PERSON> said . 
Police are now able to collect evidence from the scene of a crime , analyze it in a lab and process the results through a DNA databank from <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> . 
This process allows them to obtain and arrest a suspect without the fallibility of human eyewitnesses or incomplete fingerprints . 
Although DNA can identify a suspect almost beyond a reasonable doubt , police still continue the " legwork " of days past . 
" When we get a hit [ in the databank ] we do n't stop right there ... we question , we check all the ways we would 've done before . 
We have to do the whole process to cover all leads and to clearly identify the suspect , " <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Michael Coleman</PERSON> said . 
The incorporation of DNA evidence has prompted new investigative training for police officers . 
Detective <PERSON>Pugh</PERSON> , who played an integral part in the <DATE>August</DATE> arrest of <PERSON>Shannon Leo Malnowski</PERSON> on two counts of rape and forcible sodomy based on DNA evidence , attended the <ORGANIZATION>Forensic Academy</ORGANIZATION> , which emphasized the importance of the collection , preservation and delivery of forensic evidence . 
<PERSON>Pugh</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Academy</ORGANIZATION> taught her " there is always going to be evidence . 
You just have to find it . " 
" There are possibilities now that there were n't a long time ago ... with DNA , evidence can come from many sources , " she added . 
The identification technology enabled by DNA evidence has had a great impact on cases that would have been considered unsolvable just <DATE>20 years ago</DATE> . 
DNA has allowed police to apprehend suspects that were not identifiable in any other way besides their DNA profiles . 
" In the <DATE>last 12 months</DATE> over a dozen suspects have been identified by DNA alone , " <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Lt. Chip Harding</ORGANIZATION> said . 
Harding , a founding member of Citizens for DNA , an activist group that lobbied the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> to have former Gov. <PERSON>George Allen</PERSON> allocate <MONEY>$ 9.5 million</MONEY> to the <ORGANIZATION>DNA</ORGANIZATION> databank , said " a huge amount of violent crimes are now prosecuted that in the '70s or early '80s would 've had no resolution . " 
He pointed out the need to raise awareness of the importance of DNA technology because of its positive qualities . 
" The general public thinks that it 's being used nationally and it 's not , " he said . 
" I deeply believe that if DNA technology was used [ as extensively ] nationally as it is here in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , a lot of your serial killers [ and rapists ] would be caught . " 
The use of DNA evidence has had a profound effect upon the prosecutors and defense attorneys in the legal system as well . 
Because DNA identification is more reliable than eyewitness identification , it is very important for the prosecutor to show the evidence was not in any way tampered with . 
Commonwealth Attorney <PERSON>Dave Chapman</PERSON> said DNA evidence is " compelling and it is very hard for jurors to ignore it so long as the evidence is collected and handled appropriately . " 
Asst. Commonwealth Attorney <PERSON>Ronald M. Huber</PERSON> described presenting DNA evidence in court as " an educational process for the jury . " 
Juries must be shown how the evidence was collected , preserved and delivered to the lab so there is no questioning of the validity of the evidence being presented . 
" It has called upon us as prosecutors of how to deal with the scientific endeavor of DNA testing ... principally in the <DATE>last 10 years</DATE> , " <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> said . 
Defense attorney <PERSON>Lloyd J. Snook III</PERSON> said DNA evidence has changed the way a defendant will approach a case in court , and therefore the attorney must change accordingly . 
" I go by what my client says ... what usually happens is [ DNA ] induces people to plead guilty , " <PERSON>Snook</PERSON> said . 
In most rape cases in which a victim sustains injuries , the only line of defense is to try to call the evidence into question . 
The presentation " of the preservation and collection of evidence in court is so important because a defense attorney will speculate every piece of evidence , " <PERSON>Rittenhouse</PERSON> said .
