Courtesy Spycar Books Set in a small , fictional <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> town , <PERSON>Tom Lukas</PERSON> ' " Special Operations " claims to be " a thriller that could save a life . " 
The novel follows old-fashioned , no-nonsense First Detective <PERSON>Nick Giaccone</PERSON> as he tries to understand the twisted mind of the Illuminator , a war-veteran-nurse-turned-vigilante . 
<PERSON>Giaccone</PERSON> is about to retire when the Illuminator appears in sleepy <LOCATION>Goddard</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION> . 
Traumatized by the death of her brother , the Illuminator becomes determined to punish people guilty of committing heinous crimes . 
She goes as far as to surgically transform a suspected sexual predator into the physical manifestation of <LOCATION>Count Dracula</LOCATION> . 
Although the identity of the Illuminator is known from the beginning , the plot of " Special Operations " is gripping from the first page . 
The psychological showdown between <PERSON>Cassandra</PERSON> - the woman behind the Illuminator - and <PERSON>Giaccone</PERSON> is absorbing on its own , but the book 's revelations on grief and forgiveness are what make " Special Operations " difficult to put down . 
While the author 's writing style takes a little getting used to , the complex prose is necessary to reflect the religious fanaticism of the Illuminator . 
<PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> ' ability to illustrate the character 's irrational obsession while still creating realistic emotional depth is certainly one of the high points of the novel . 
Although " Special Operations " is a great work of fiction in and of itself , the purpose behind it differentiates it from other psychological thriller novels . 
" I wrote ' Special Operations ' ... to put at least one balanced story about surviving male childhood sexual abuse on the map , " <PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> said . 
" One that would equally entertain , and dramatize the dilemma faced by male survivors of sexual child abuse , who in our culture go horribly under-represented , which proliferates a cultural avoidance that can be very dangerous - to survivors and to others . " 
As a teenager , <PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> was sexually abused by an older man , causing him to withdraw from his interests and from the people around him . 
It took <PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> a long time to gather the courage to rebuff the man 's advances . 
" Once I had found the strength to tell [ the man ] ' no more , ever , ' ... I remember that I stood up , straightened my back , and told him , ' you know one day I 'm going to write a book about you , ' " <PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> said . 
Throughout the entire experience , however , <PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> said he discovered his desire to write . 
After high school , <PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> used his spare time trying to imitate the pieces he read in literary journals , like The New Yorker . 
Despite many rejections , <PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> continued to write . 
He eventually decided to enroll at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> to study English Literature . 
At <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> once again encountered instances of sexual abuse when a friend claimed to be sexually assaulted by a faculty member . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> took no disciplinary action against the reported perpetrator . 
Lukas materialized his anger and frustration over these traumatizing experiences and expressed them in his first novel , " Contrapasso , or , A Season of Consequence . " 
Lukas decided to channel his experiences into a fictional novel instead of a memoir because of an article published by <PERSON>Karen A. Olio</PERSON> and <PERSON>William F. Cornell</PERSON> , titled " Making Meaning , Not Monsters : Reflections on the Delayed Memory Controversy . " " 
[ The article ] talks about psychological processes through which survivors of sexual child abuse make meaning of [ a ] biographical event and recognize salient fact ... I thought : no way I can help a reader accomplish that by writing a memoir , " <PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> said . 
" I think fiction - the overarching metaphor of a novel - presents the crucial truths more universally . " 
<PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> said he hopes " Special Operations " will help people unite against sexual violence . 
In light of recent sexual assault issues the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community continues to navigate , <PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> hopes that his novel can be used in <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> courses . 
" I wanted to write a book so raw and honest it would shift some readers out of ' neutral ' - shatter patterns of quiescence , " <PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> ' dedication to raising awareness about sexual violence and male sexual abuse survivors extends beyond literary endeavors . 
He has fitted his Spy Car , a black vintage Cadillac , with the <ORGANIZATION>Literary Canon</ORGANIZATION> - a mechanical arm that allows people to quite literally , " throw the book at sexual violence " - and is driving it across the country . 
He hopes to bring the Spy Car to <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> in support of Take Back the <TIME>Night</TIME> , a mid-April event dedicated to supporting sexual violence survivors and raising awareness . 
Beginning this <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , <PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> will be holding a three-day giveaway in which members of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community will be able to obtain the Kindle version of " Special Operations " for free . 
" Special Operations " is the first installment of <PERSON>Lukas</PERSON> ' ' The Seethrough Spybook Series . ' 
Lukas is currently working on what is sure to be an equally-thrilling sequel , " Blood Rain . "
