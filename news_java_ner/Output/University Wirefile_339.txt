Freshman defenseman <PERSON>Ken Clausen</PERSON> , however , has become one of the team 's primary contributors . 
The No. 1 defenseman recruit in the nation according to <ORGANIZATION>Inside Lacrosse</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Clausen</PERSON> is one of only two first-line freshmen for <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . 
Coaches and teammates alike have been mesmerized by the maturity <PERSON>Clausen</PERSON> has shown beyond his rookie status . 
" He 's got poise and he has a sense of attentiveness in the field game that 's a little uncanny for a first-year player , " <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> coach <PERSON>Dom Starsia</PERSON> said . 
" He does some things that are indicative of an upperclassman , somebody with more experience , and that 's probably what got him on the field as much as anything else . " 
The area that <PERSON>Clausen</PERSON> has excelled in the most is groundballs . 
He leads the team with 49 groundballs on the season , which is nearly unheard of for a freshman defenseman . 
" Everyone on our defense brings something to the game , and I really wanted to figure out something I could contribute to the players that we have , " <PERSON>Clausen</PERSON> said . 
" The groundballs are something that I really take pride in and something I hope I can continue to do for the rest of the season . " 
<PERSON>Clausen</PERSON> has also shown his ability to be outspoken on the field . 
Communication is one of the most important aspects of any team defense , and <PERSON>Clausen</PERSON> has already established himself as a vocal leader for <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . 
" He 's very talkative off the ball , and that 's a very strange thing coming from a rookie , " senior goalkeeper <PERSON>Kip Turner</PERSON> said . 
" You usually learn that by your third or fourth year , but he picked it up very quickly . " 
Although <PERSON>Clausen</PERSON> was highly touted as a high school senior , the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> coaching staff had not seen much of him before this year . 
After initially committing to <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Clausen</PERSON> made a last-minute decision to attend <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> following a scandal in which several Duke players were arrested on rape charges . 
As a result , the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> coaching staff did not know what to expect from <PERSON>Clausen</PERSON> as the year began . 
" The freshmen and upperclassmen were all battling [ for ] what was one spot in the starting rotation , " <PERSON>Starsia</PERSON> said . 
" Because he was going to <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> , I really had n't paid that much attention to him at the beginning of the year playing-wise . " 
As the fall progressed , however , it became clear that <PERSON>Clausen</PERSON> was going to live up to the preseason hype . 
" At first when you come here you want to just be able to hang with the players you 're around , " <PERSON>Clausen</PERSON> said . 
" Once you start getting more comfortable , I think it 's everyone 's goal to get playing time . " 
Players like <PERSON>Clausen</PERSON> will have the responsibility of maintaining the winning tradition of men 's lacrosse . 
The way he has performed this season , it appears that <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's future is in safe hands . 
" <PERSON>Ken Clausen</PERSON> is somebody who 's going to be a leader at the defensive end of the field , " <PERSON>Starsia</PERSON> said . 
" He 's going to be one of the outstanding defenders in the country without a doubt , but he 's also going to be a leader on this team throughout his career . "
