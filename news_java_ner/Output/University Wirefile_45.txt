Despite <DATE>Saturday</DATE> 's announcement that <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> is the likely father of his slave <PERSON>Sally Hemings</PERSON> 's son , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students are hesitant to condemn their school 's founder . 
Second-year College student <PERSON>Tim Estes</PERSON> , who is president of the non-partisan student-based <ORGANIZATION>Jefferson Leadership Foundation</ORGANIZATION> , said he still respects <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> even after the all-but-conclusive finding made by retired <ORGANIZATION>University Pathology Prof. Eugene Foster</ORGANIZATION> . 
" In judging historical figures , you must separate the man from the ideals , " <PERSON>Estes</PERSON> said . 
" This research does not taint what <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> stood for . " 
But Foster 's DNA evidence does confirm the almost 200-year-old claim that <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> fathered a son with one of his slaves . 
The scientific analysis , which is detailed in the <DATE>Nov. 5</DATE> issue of the science journal Nature , used genetic material from <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> 's and <PERSON>Hemings</PERSON> ' descendants to prove that the nation 's third president fathered the slave 's youngest son <PERSON>Eston Hemings</PERSON> . 
Geneticists compared blood from descendents of both families and found that both <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hemings</PERSON> descendents shared similar Y chromosomes -- male genetic material that passes almost unchanged from generation to generation . 
While <PERSON>Estes</PERSON> believes the evidence is strong , he said " Nothing is for certain . 
It may be a few weeks , maybe months before the results are looked over by people in the field . 
It 's important to have a moderated reaction and not make a knee-jerk judgement . " 
For other students , the finding only verifies what they already believed . 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Dana Richburg</PERSON> said she believes <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> fathered more than one child with <PERSON>Sally Hemings</PERSON> . 
" He told her he would free the children when they turned 21 , and he did free most of the <PERSON>Hemings</PERSON> and made sure they had extensive skills , " <PERSON>Richburg</PERSON> said . 
" They were his kids , clearly . " 
Jefferson 's reputation as a leading engineer of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's political system probably will prevail at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Though students deeply respect <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> , some of them were not surprised by the scientific discovery . 
" As a U.Va . 
student , it 's easy to get caught up in the nostalgia of <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> and glorify him , " Student Council President <PERSON>Howard A. Foard III</PERSON> said . 
" But I 'm not surprised by the finding . 
Many slave owners had kids with slaves . " 
But <PERSON>Richburg</PERSON> said she is afraid some <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> enthusiasts will refuse to believe the evidence in order to maintain an idolized view of <LOCATION>Jefferson</LOCATION> . 
" A lot of people will go into denial . 
For these people , <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> will be the man no matter what , " she said . 
" At times the fact that some people are n't acknowledging that slavery occurred is upsetting and infuriating . 
Jefferson owned slaves . 
He was just a man . " 
Foard agreed and said he sees <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> 's use of slavery as more damaging to his character than his secret affair with <PERSON>Sally Hemings</PERSON> . 
" We need to recognize that slavery did occur , " he said . 
Many students echoed <ORGANIZATION>Foard</ORGANIZATION> 's concerns . 
" The fact that he had a child with a slave is not a big deal to me since his wife [ <PERSON>Martha</PERSON> ] had died " in <DATE>1782</DATE> , third-year College student <PERSON>Matt Kramer</PERSON> said . 
" What concerns me is the larger issue that this was a person who was his property . 
The fact that <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> owned slaves is a more disturbing issue for me . " 
Other students noted <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> 's contradictory values -- he vocalized discontent with the institution of slavery while he owned slaves . 
College Republicans President <PERSON>Mike Jeffreys</PERSON> defended <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> 's apparent hypocrisy . 
" <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> was a great man , but there were some things about him that were less than admirable , " <PERSON>Jeffreys</PERSON> said . 
" I do n't think he was happy owning slaves . 
He was a man with the same emotions we have , and he owned slaves because he did n't know how to survive in the southern economy without it . 
" People run into trouble when they try to classify him as a good man or a bad man , " he said . 
" The distinctions do n't have to be exclusive . " 
While the DNA evidence shows that <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> probably did in fact father a child with one of his slaves , the investigation can not provide insight to the nature of the relationship between <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Hemings</ORGANIZATION> . 
But <PERSON>Kramer</PERSON> said he believes <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> abided by the same moral standards about which he wrote . 
" After reading many of his writings and going to this school , you get the sense that you know him , " he said . 
" I always received the impression he was concerned with moral issues . 
He would n't force himself on another human being . 
It must have been love . " 
<PERSON>Kramer</PERSON> acknowledged that slave rape was a common practice by owners . 
" If it was rape , then you have to say that his reputation is tarnished , " he said . 
Other students said historians should not overlook the nature of the master/slave relationship . 
<PERSON>Foard</PERSON> said there is no difference between <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> raping <PERSON>Hemings</PERSON> or engaging in consensual sex with her . 
Hemings was owned by <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> , which simply made the act an abuse of power . 
" The fact of the matter is that he had a relationship with a slave , " he said . 
" Power should not be what a relationship is about . " 
" We ca n't overlook the fact that she was a slave , " <PERSON>Richburg</PERSON> said . 
" She may not have had a choice since he owned her and could legally do as he wished . " 
The recent evidence about <PERSON>Eston Hemings</PERSON> 's paternity has political repercussions outside of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> . 
In the midst of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal , the report proves that historic figures also are susceptible to scandal . 
Many students compared <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> 's and <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> 's actions . 
" Just as you should n't deify a founding father , you should n't diminish him to justify a modern leader 's behavior , " <PERSON>Estes</PERSON> said . 
" Both figures exhibited reckless moral behavior , but <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> showed better judgement . 
Jefferson was n't married , and he showed a sense of honor by being generous to the girl . " 
<PERSON>Jeffreys</PERSON> said he disagreed with people who condemn <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> but defend <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> . 
" Some people want to tar and feather <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> , " he said . 
" These same people want to excuse <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> for lying under oath . 
Jefferson never perjured himself . 
He had a forbidden love , and the relationship was Shakespearean sad . " 
But he added that while he does not think <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> should be condemned for the affair , he thinks the relationship was morally wrong . 
" Even if it was love , the relationship could not have been good , " <PERSON>Jeffreys</PERSON> said . 
" Since slavery was morally incorrect , anything coming out of slavery , including this relationship , was morally incorrect . " 
Other students said historians should incorporate the new findings into <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> 's overall reputation . 
" We should n't ignore the relationship , " <PERSON>Kramer</PERSON> said . 
" It must be included in any biography so people can decide for themselves how moral <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> was . 
Ultimately , we have to accept <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> 's use of slavery and the relationship [ with <PERSON>Hemings</PERSON> ] as two of <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> 's flaws . "
