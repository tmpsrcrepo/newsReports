The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's code of ethics requires <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> leadership to treat all students equally . 
The code says the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is committed to " guaranteeing equal opportunity and nondiscrimination with respect to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> services , programs , activities and employment . " 
However , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> continuously restricts the rights of one group of students : students who play <ORGANIZATION>National Collegiate Athletic Association</ORGANIZATION> sports . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's membership in the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> means the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is complicit in keeping alive one of the greatest surviving instances of institutionalized discrimination in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
University athletes are prohibited by <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> rules from profiting from their own skills , name and likeness . 
Every other <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student , even those on full scholarship , is afforded that fundamental civil right . 
So long as you have not been named a " student-athlete , " you can get paid by <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> and enjoy a free meal without a guilty conscience . 
You could even sell your autograph or start a crowdfunding page for your personal ambitions . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> may even applaud and commend your initiative if you did so . 
But if you happen to wear the <ORGANIZATION>Cavaliers</ORGANIZATION> jersey on game days , not only may you not promote yourself for personal gain , but you will be shamed and shunned by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> for even daring to do so . 
Take , for example , the case of a crowdfunding website I helped build : FanPay.org . 
Our website crowdfunds graduation incentives for college students and college athletes . 
Students must graduate to access the funds , thereby motivating them to finish their degree . 
The goals of our website are not complicated : to help college athletes get an education and get a down payment on their lives after college sports . 
However , in <DATE>November of last year</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's athletic department sent us a cease and desist letter . 
The letter noted that our graduation incentives may be in violation of <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> Bylaw 12.5.2.2 , which prohibits athletes from profiting from their personal brand . 
Ironically , another arcane <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> bylaw , 12.1.2.1.4.3.3 , specifically allows for financial incentives for college athletes who earn Olympic medals . 
Do <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> members care more about the education of its athletes or athletic glory ? 
We at FanPay question why U.Va . 
is so opposed to crowdfunded graduation incentives , as U.Va . 
is not immune to the huge social and economic ills found in college sports today . 
For example , <LOCATION>U.Va</LOCATION> . 
boasts a stellar <PERCENT>93 percent</PERCENT> federal graduation rate . 
By comparison , the five-year average graduation rate of the main revenue-generating sports at U.Va. , men 's basketball and football , on average stand at roughly just <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT> and <PERCENT>66 percent</PERCENT> , respectively . 
Statistics like these , which show that every incoming mens basketball player is just half as likely to graduate from U.Va . 
than their non-athlete peers , seriously undermine the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's insistence that it takes the education and well-being of its athletes seriously . 
Sky-high salaries for U.Va . 
's coaches make the situation look even more exploitative . 
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's basketball coach rakes in nearly <MONEY>$ 2.2 million</MONEY> per year , and the football coach makes <MONEY>$ 3.2 million</MONEY> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> limits the number of players who can receive scholarships at 13 for mens basketball and 85 for football . 
If these salaries were halved and split with the athletes , each of the 13 mens scholarship basketball players would earn over <MONEY>$ 84,000</MONEY> per year and each of the 85 scholarship football players would earn almost <MONEY>$ 19,000</MONEY> per year . 
Race is deeply embedded in these issues . 
While NCAA policies are equally discriminatory against all races , they disproportionately harm young black men . 
Only <PERCENT>6-10 percent</PERCENT> of U.Va . 
students are African-American or multiracial , but the racial compositions of the two revenue-generating sports teams are both well over <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> African-American . 
The tentacles of the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> monopoly stretch far and wide across its almost 1,300 member colleges and universities and across all of their corporate , government , and non-profit partners . 
Not only do these counterproductive rules harm students personally and financially , but their Byzantine rigidity also serves to stifle innovative and proactive improvements like FanPay . 
Rather than adopting a progressive and forward-thinking approach to reforming college sports , leading institutions like U.Va . 
have found it convenient to hide behind the scapegoat of <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> rules in order to avoid tough questions about the ongoing abuse of the civil rights of college athletes on their campuses . 
U.Va . 
's code of ethics also states that " Complaints of discrimination , harassment and retaliation are investigated and when warranted appropriate corrective action is taken . " 
President <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> , I urge you to investigate this complaint and be brave in taking corrective action . 
<PERSON>Tony Klausing</PERSON> is the co-founder of FanPay.org .
