The <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> men 's lacrosse team will look to go undefeated in conference play for the second consecutive season this <DATE>weekend</DATE> as it faces Duke <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Durham</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>N.C</LOCATION> . 
The Cavaliers ( 10-1 , 2-0 ACC ) prevailed against what proved to be a tough <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> team 10-9 in overtime <DATE>last weekend</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>Klockner Stadium</ORGANIZATION> . 
The narrow victory kept the nation 's longest winning streak alive for the <ORGANIZATION>Cavaliers</ORGANIZATION> . 
There is much more on the line this <DATE>weekend</DATE> , however , than a winning streak . 
The winner of this <DATE>weekend</DATE> 's matchup will be the <ORGANIZATION>ACC</ORGANIZATION> regular season champion and will consequently earn the No. 1 seed in the ACC Tournament . 
Like <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , the Blue Devils ( 9-2 , 2-0 ACC ) are undefeated in conference play and understand the importance of this game . 
This season is especially meaningful for <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> , as the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Devils</ORGANIZATION> are trying to prove themselves after having had their season cancelled last year because of a scandal involving sexual assault . 
Duke proved its potential the last time the two teams met , beating the Cavaliers 17-2 in <LOCATION>Durham</LOCATION> in <DATE>2005</DATE> . 
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> senior goalie <PERSON>Kip Turner</PERSON> was in the cage for that game and will look to redeem himself this <DATE>weekend</DATE> . 
The senior is coming off of a very strong performance in the win against <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and was named ACC Player of the Week for his efforts . 
" We are a little nervous . 
I am especially a little nervous because the last time we went there I kind of got shelled , " <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said . 
" Hopefully this time will be a different story , and I think that last time was kind of a fluke game and this time we know we need to bring our A-game to <LOCATION>Durham</LOCATION> . " 
The Cavaliers must play better offense than they did against the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Devils</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>2005</DATE> if they want to stand a chance of winning . 
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> will look to junior attackman <PERSON>Ben Rubeor</PERSON> to lead the offense into battle and to create scoring opportunities . 
Rubeor is the nation 's leading goal-scorer with 37 goals and also has the most points in the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> with 54 . 
Duke has some offensive firepower of its own . 
The duo of junior attackman <PERSON>Zack Greer</PERSON> and senior attackman <PERSON>Matt Danowski</PERSON> create a force to be reckoned with . 
Greer ranks just behind Rubeor with 34 goals and <PERSON>Danowski</PERSON> has 25 of his own this season . 
Sophomore defenseman <PERSON>Matt Kelly</PERSON> is aware that he and his teammates will have to play hard to overcome Duke this <DATE>weekend</DATE> . 
" They are a pretty talented offense , " <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> said . 
" They have a couple guys that really stand out and so we need to contain them and play well as a team -- not just the first half or second half , but the whole game all together . " 
Coach <PERSON>Dom Starsia</PERSON> knows <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> boasts a phenomenal defense as well , including four pre-season All-Americans . 
<PERSON>Starsia</PERSON> said the teams have much in common and predicted a low score for this <DATE>weekend</DATE> 's contest . 
" If you look at the two teams and the statistics of both teams , you see two teams that are very similar in a lot of ways , " <PERSON>Starsia</PERSON> said . 
" We are going to have to play very well at both ends of the field in order to be successful . 
This will be the best game that we will have played over the course of the season . 
We are going to have our hands full going down to <LOCATION>Durham</LOCATION> . "
