Reactions to Rolling Stone 's article detailing the gang rape of a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student by several fraternity brothers have been a mixture of anger , disgust and despair . 
It is impossible to hold onto our pride knowing such behavior not only occurred , but was also downplayed and brushed off by members of our community . 
The horrific story is one that had to be told . 
It is immortalized now , unable to be ignored . 
Denial is a human reaction ; we do n't want to confront the tragedies that occur in our community . 
It 's easier to say " That could n't have happened - those are all good guys , " than to say " I believe you . " 
Because when we believe , we have to believe there is a possibility the same fate could befall us . 
And we do n't want to live in a world like that . 
But that is the world we live in . 
The merit of this article is that it pushes everyone to confront that world ; it has aroused the anger and frustration which is necessary to create change . 
The risk , however , is that the negative portrayal of the administration could lead students to see <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> as an antagonist rather than an ally . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's system has flaws . 
Rolling Stone 's investigation has demonstrated that in an effort to prioritize a victim 's autonomy , overall student safety may be compromised - and that is a balance the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> must constantly be evaluating . 
This is the issue we grappled with when considering the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's new mandatory reporting policy . 
The article has also led many to think the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is more concerned with protecting its reputation than with addressing the needs of survivors . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> must take accountability for all shortcomings , past or present . 
But it is vital to remember that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is also an essential resource for survivors , and distrust will not facilitate reporting that is necessary for a university support system to function . 
Survivors can access more resources from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> than just the opportunity to file a complaint and go through formal or informal resolutions . 
They can ask that a no-contact order be issued to perpetrators ; they can ask perpetrators be removed from their classes or from their dorms ; and if survivors are struggling to complete academic work , they can withdraw from classes without marks on their records . 
Survivors should know these opportunities to improve their well-being without any adjudications are available to them if they go to the administration . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has also invited the public to comment on its recently revised sexual misconduct policy . 
Reading and commenting on the policy would be one opportunity for students to channel their current frustrations into constructive change . 
And if we truly want the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to hold accountable the perpetrators of these crimes , survivors can not be discouraged from reporting , whether by their peers who do not believe their stories , or by national publications which spotlight an institution 's failures and ignore its attempts to improve . 
We can sit around the table and debate the ethics of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's policies for as long as we want , but if survivors do not come forward , these policies have no reports to be applied to . 
A survivor 's decision not to report must always be respected , but we hope a survivor is not discouraged from reporting because of any mistrust and demonization of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> which results from sweeping negative portrayals such as this one . 
Hopefully , the courage of the survivors in this piece and the anger this story incites will motivate a change in culture that is necessary to foster respect for one another , normalize bystander intervention , and encourage survivors to come forward . 
Change will not happen if their feelings of guilt and brokenness are compounded by the community 's denial of their pain . 
The anger , disgust and despair we feel reading this story is akin to feeling a small fraction of that pain . 
What do we take away from this experience now that it has disturbed us ? 
How do we channel that emotional reaction into a change in our community ?
