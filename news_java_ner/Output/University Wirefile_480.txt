One Less and the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Team have teamed up to promote bystander intervention and practicing safety this Halloween weekend . 
In a program they are calling " Reverse Trick or Treating , " ADAPT , a peer education group , and One Less , a student organization which works to combat sexual violence on Grounds , have been handing out candy along with tips on how to have a safe night in exchange for signing a pledge to be an active bystander this Halloween . " 
[ The aim is ] to practice safe drinking , not not drinking , " said ADAPT member <PERSON>Kristen Smith</PERSON> , a third-year Education student . 
The pledge asks students to commit to help out other students in need , or in a tricky situation where alcohol may be involved . 
The goal of the reverse trick or treating pledge is to promote safe habits , not to discourage students from going out , said <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> and fellow ADAPT member <PERSON>Sydney Speetjens</PERSON> , a third-year <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> student . " 
[ The goal is that ] everybody ultimately has a fun but safe Halloween , " <PERSON>Speetjens</PERSON> said . 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Ashley Brown</PERSON> , the president of One Less , said group members are excited to work with ADAPT to promote bystander intervention . 
Alcohol is closely related to issues of sexual assault on Grounds , she said . 
" Drinking is a large factor in what creates this culture at U.Va. , " <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> said . 
" Be safe and be aware of your surroundings . " 
All week , the CIOs will be handing out cups of free candy , each labeled with a superhero-themed safety tip such as , " Do n't hide your secret identity , carry your ID . " 
Light-up toy wands will also be distributed to the first 500 people who sign the pledge . 
As part of a regimen of safe drinking , ADAPT recommends alternating drinks with food and water , understanding the symptoms of alcohol poisoning and utilizing a buddy system . 
These are general tips that everyone already knows , <ORGANIZATION>Gordie Center for Substance Abuse Prevention</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Susan Bruce</PERSON> said . 
She emphasized the importance of reminders , though - even to cross the street safely when wearing a costume and remembering that people are often not recognizable when in costume . " 
[ We are ] reminding students of safety tips they already know - it 's Halloween , so it 's even more important , " <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON> said . 
" Students are in a costume , it 's a different feeling , and they do n't remember the safety messages in their heads . " 
ADAPT also aims to remind students about the logistics of getting help if needed . 
Calling an ambulance in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> is always free of charge . 
While such information is constantly relevant , ADAPT members said they aim to especially stress safety information at times of the year known for heavy drinking - including Halloween , <ORGANIZATION>Spring Break</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Foxfield</ORGANIZATION> . 
One Less and ADAPT will be tabling in front of the <ORGANIZATION>Elson Student Health Center</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Observatory Hill Dining Hall</ORGANIZATION> and on the Lawn throughout the week .
