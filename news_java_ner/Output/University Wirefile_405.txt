<DATE>Monday</DATE> in The Cavalier Daily was a highly offensivepiece - interesting coming from a newspaper , but becoming more and more common . 
I suppose that if the Wall Street Journal is allowed to berate women for beingsingle , a Cavalier Daily writer is more than allowed to berate women for abortion . 
However , while ( ashamedly ) reading the very idealistic , narrow-minded support of Senator <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> in spite of his decision to describe pregnant women as " hosts " ( side note - are women only hosts if they carry a boy ? ) 
, I could n't help but laugh at the lack of understanding of sex . 
Someone alert the newspapers - yet another Republican WASP is unaware of what actually goes on , preaching abstinence from a high horse of prosperity . 
The writer seems to brush over the fact that condoms break , abstinence plans fail , not all sex is consensual and the pill has yet to be 100 percent effective . 
However , I will agree with her in the sense that prevention is the best step to avoiding this dirty , shameful issue altogether . 
Yet , allow me another " however , " for I think her idea of prevention is strongly drawn from her own educational experience . 
It lacks any research of the issue - well , I guess that 's allowed when it comes to personal opinions . 
For those who seek more information , I 'm bringing anecdotal info instead of statistics . 
It may be interesting to note that while Republicans are fighting sex-education classes , a teacher told me that she now has to escort her sixth graders into the bathroom . 
Why ? 
Because they were caught too many times having sex in the stalls . 
Additionally , I have heard accounts of young women sticking their birth control where babies come from . 
When looked into , it appears that about <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of women misinterpret or do not read the instructions for oral contraceptives . 
It is apparent that a lack of approachable sex education is most definitely a cause of unwanted pregnancies . 
Nonetheless , ironically the very states that are trying to bring abortion back to the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> are those that simultaneously fight instating a more thoroughsex education # for their kids ( looking at you , <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> ) . 
Sex between preteens and misconceptions of female physiology are but a myth in <PERSON>Berger</PERSON> 's " preventative " opinion column ; I 'm sure this is because we live in a world in which women can now reject semen from a rape . 
But the real prevention issues stem from obscure corners that many of us can not imagine , and then we have to accept that sometimes accidents are truly accidents . 
While I believe everyone deserves their own opinion - trust me , I have more than enough of my own - I think <PERSON>Berger</PERSON> 's opinion shames and belittles others . 
" You can keep yourself from getting pregnant in the first place " is no longer an opinion , but a judgment . 
And one that lacks any form of understanding . 
Note : this was written by a Republican WASP <PERSON>Natasha Mighell</PERSON> is a fourth-year in the <ORGANIZATION>Comm School</ORGANIZATION> .
