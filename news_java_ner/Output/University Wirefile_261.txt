THE FAMOUS actor <PERSON>Will Rogers</PERSON> , mocking Prohibition in the <DATE>1920s</DATE> , wondered , " Why do n't they pass an amendment prohibiting anybody from learning anything ? 
If it works as well as the Prohibition did , in five years Americans will be the smartest race of people on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> . " 
<PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> ' quote points out the seemingly self-evident futility of attempts to prohibit alcohol consumption where alcohol consumption already exists . 
This fact , however , has not deterred the new Alcohol and <ORGANIZATION>Beverage Control</ORGANIZATION> officer in town , <PERSON>Kevin Davis</PERSON> , from launching a blitzkrieg on underage drinking in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , thus effectively galvanizing students accommodated to the trust afforded to them by local enforcement policies . 
Last year , upon his arrival , <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> stepped up <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> presence on the Corner and cancelled several drink options , including <PERSON>Jaberwoke</PERSON> 's famous " Clam " drink . 
Furthermore , <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> has made clear that he takes his job of eradicating underage drinking in the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> very seriously . 
This job implicitly includes eliminating underage drinking in fraternity environments . 
It is strongly suspected ( although not confirmed ) that the new approach to fraternities includes sending undercover , underage students to reconnoiter their underage serving policies . 
If the fraternity serves the student agent alcohol , then all members of the fraternity who paid for the alcohol as well as all underage drinkers can be arrested . 
On one end of the spectrum , many students have ( perhaps rightfully so ) reacted with outrage . 
The recent and vigorous application of drinking laws in a college atmosphere seems not only arbitrary but overly ambitious as well . 
Underage drinking is an inevitability in big college campuses , one that even immoderate amounts of money and resources will probably not eradicate . 
College students , like Americans during Prohibition , can not realistically be stopped from drinking . 
This leads to the conclusion that even the most aggressive efforts will only result in the capricious arrest of a few unlucky students . 
These students will feel as though they were treated arbitrarily , given that many of their underage friends escaped the wrath of state enforcement , which , according to the <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> 's Web site , can present itself in the form of fines of up to <MONEY>$ 500</MONEY> , loss of driver 's licenses , 50 hours of community service and even up to one year in prison . 
However , it is considerably important for outraged students to understand that <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> is simply performing his job to the best of his ability . 
On the other end of the spectrum are the quixotic and idealistic ambitions of <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> , who aims to eradicate underage drinking . 
In the pursuit of these implausible dreams , <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> is touching a dicey issue , mainly the traditional sense of trust within our community . 
With their increased presence , they are also putting undue stress on <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students in the form of financial , physical and psychological harassment . 
Most importantly , however , the increased presence and control exerted by <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> offends the much hyped system of self-governance in place at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's policy is one that does not doubt the ability of students to govern themselves . 
The presence and overall effectiveness of <ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee and Honor</ORGANIZATION> are a broad testament to this concept . 
More specifically , however , fraternities as student organizations also have this ability . 
Dean of Fraternity and Sorority Life <PERSON>Aaron Laushway</PERSON> said in a phone interview that , " In the tradition of student self-governance , fraternities have their own structure in place . 
They have the responsibility of ensuring that their governing bodies are working efficiently and successfully . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> demonstrated this recently as they called on fraternities to increase vigilance in order to maximize safety in fraternities . 
<PERSON>Ross Kimbel</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> , said in an interview that the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> is " encouraging frats to work the door extremely tight . " 
<PERSON>Kimbel</PERSON> also mentioned that party patrol ( individuals that walk around from frat to frat ensuring <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policies are being adhered to ) will now go undercover " in order to simulate the new <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> policy and increase vigilance among brothers . " 
He expects the new <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> policies not only to help cut excessive binge drinking but to raise overall safety and security at fraternity parties . 
Ultimately , <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> has the jurisdiction and prerogative to make arrests and enforce drinking laws as they see fit . 
Students should realize that local and state enforcement officials are merely doing their job and that they should be afforded all possible respect . 
On the other hand , realistically speaking , increasing the intensity of arrest efforts will probably have little effect on overall underage drinking at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
This goal can better be achieved by cooperating with organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> in order to allow self-governance to protect our community . 
The primary concern behind drinking laws is safety , a concern which has historically been best addressed when done in collaboration with local communities .
