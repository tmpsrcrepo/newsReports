Last week , author <PERSON>Caryl Phillips</PERSON> read a section of his new novel " The Lost Child " to an audience on Grounds . 
Phillips is known for his post-colonial style of writing - characterized by a passage of time and space as well as insight into how history dwells on names and people . 
Not only is he is a prolific writer , but <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> also became the youngest English tenured professor in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> when he accepted the position of visiting writer at <ORGANIZATION>Amherst College</ORGANIZATION> . 
His life as a <LOCATION>Caribbean</LOCATION> child in a country that refused to accept his British identity shaped his writing and helped him realize " the job of a writer is to shine a flashlight into the darker corners of the human soul and illuminate the things that keep us up in the middle of the night , " he said . 
Phillips began by reading a piece about the book and his experience writing it . 
The passage 's opening lines revealed <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> ' opinion that " living inside a book for so long may make one lose sight of what the book is actually about , " elaborating on his inability to give people a definite answer about the book 's nature . 
His life story captivated the audience . 
Phillips moved to <LOCATION>Yorkshire</LOCATION> as a young boy and lived through two major life-changing incidents - the Moors murders , a series of sexual assaults and murders of children , and his weeklong stint at a camp for underprivileged children in <LOCATION>Lancashire</LOCATION> . 
He shared how " The Lost Child " came into existence from these two incidences , which he summarized and saved on five post-it notes labeled " Yorkshire , " " Moor , " " Lost , " " Child " and " Literature . " 
" It was time to write my own book and tell an altogether different story , " <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> said . 
Even though <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> spoke about his own story , he emphasized that every story , no matter how small , is worth sharing . 
The presented excerpt detailed a scenario in which a young girl in college is reprimanded by her father , a universally familiar situation . 
Although <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> speaks about life from his own personal perspective , he allowed the wide audience to relate to his ideas and narratives . 
<PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> ' delivery was powerful and engaging . 
His slow and even pace highlighted the tension in the scenes , and his emotionally compelling conclusion hooked the audience . 
However , the best part of the live reading was the question and answer portion . 
Various queries from the crowd led <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> to talk about his cross-genre writing . 
Even though he was genuinely interested in writing only prose at first , <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> conceded to writing other genres in order to target broader audiences and accrue more earnings . 
As he said wittily , " Wanting to write prose and writing prose are two very different things . " 
<PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> also spoke about his friend who convinced him to travel across <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> on a bus . 
He claims the experience was " the best education [ he ] ever had . " 
This bus ride culminated in <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> ' fascination with <PERSON>Richard Wright</PERSON> 's " Native Son , " a novel about a black youth living in poverty . 
In reaction to the narrative , <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> revealed , " I had never read a book about people who looked like me . " 
" I want to encourage people , show them they can [ write ] too . 
I do n't want people to think that writers are strange , cloistered human beings , " he said . 
" The Lost Child " connected the audience with childhood memories and showed how these experiences have an impression on how their lives unravel . 
Likewise , <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> ' reading spread the key idea that every voice deserves a place in literature and history .
