<ORGANIZATION>Courtesy Wikimedia The Virginia House of Delegates</ORGANIZATION> passed legislation <DATE>Friday</DATE> to allow <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Network Companies</ORGANIZATION> to be licensed by the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Motor Vehicles</ORGANIZATION> . 
Del . 
Tom Rust , R-Herndon , who sponsored the bill , said TNCs - which include companies such as Uber and Lyft - are highly popular among Virginians and have garnered success in other states . 
Del . 
<PERSON>Tim Hugo</PERSON> , R-Fairfax , also expressed his support of the legislation in a press release . 
" The legislation that passed today provides the perfect balance of public safety measures while fostering innovation , " <PERSON>Hugo</PERSON> said . 
" Improving transportation for Virginians takes more than just building infrastructure ; it requires us to embrace new technology to better meet citizens ' transportation needs . " 
While the bill just passed through the state legislative body , companies like Uber have fostered their presence throughout the state for months . 
The UberX <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> team arrived before the start of the fall semester . 
" In crafting this legislation , we sought input from all stakeholders involved , and I 'm grateful for their many hours of work on it , " Rust said . 
" When the Governor signs it into law , Virginians can take advantage of this new technology with assurance that reasonable safety and liability measures are governing its use . " 
The bill will require the TNCs to fulfill multiple requirements , such as screening drivers and ensuring that each driver employed by these companies is at least 21 years old and has an appropriate driver 's license . 
In response to recent controversy regarding Uber rape allegations in major international cities , the bill will require transportation companies to complete extensive background checks of every driver - including criminal background , driving history and history of sexual offenses The bill also requires all <ORGANIZATION>TNC</ORGANIZATION> partner vehicles be titled and registered personal vehicles , have insurance and have a maximum seating capacity of no more than seven passengers , excluding the driver . 
House Speaker <PERSON>William Howell</PERSON> , R-Stafford , said the legislation shows a compromise in the community . 
" This legislation is a true compromise , incorporating input from the public , from the companies , from the <ORGANIZATION>DMV</ORGANIZATION> , from taxicab operators and many others , " <PERSON>Howell</PERSON> said . 
Uber has maintained a presence in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> for over a semester , but some students said the company 's presence has not been as apparent on locations such as the Corner compared to competitors such as Yellow Cab and College Cab . 
Second-year College student <PERSON>Lorial Yeadon</PERSON> said she noticed an Uber vehicle for the first time this past weekend during the Super Bowl . 
" It 's weird because you would think they would stand out more and have a larger presence during the weekend in order to get more popularity from students , " <PERSON>Yeadon</PERSON> said . 
" When I use them at home in <LOCATION>Seattle</LOCATION> , they are all usually black and have a unified look . " 
Under the bill , the <ORGANIZATION>DMV</ORGANIZATION> will have the authority to conduct periodic reviews of TNCs in order to ensure the requirements are being fulfilled and will authorize fees for <ORGANIZATION>DMV</ORGANIZATION> to cover the costs of implementing this program .
