Debate surrounded the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's honor and judiciary systems as they experienced unprecedented scrutiny concerning case procedures , efficiency and trial fairness during the past year . 
The close examination initiated major changes , including revisions in the <ORGANIZATION>Judiciary Committee 's Standards of Conduct</ORGANIZATION> and steps to make Honor juries racially proportional to the student body . 
Adapting to a large increase in initiated honor and judicial cases proved to be the primary challenge during the fall semester . 
<ORGANIZATION>Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> members faced a less significant increase in the number of cases , but reported more severe Standards violations than in past years . 
Increased community awareness led to examination of honor system procedures early in the <DATE>spring</DATE> semester . 
<ORGANIZATION>Black Student Alliance and Black Law Students Association</ORGANIZATION> members presented a list of concerns to the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Feb. 22</DATE> , demanding reforms in jury composition , case initiation processes , diversity training , support officer recruitment and <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> efficiency in order to make the system more fair for minority students . 
In response , the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> created task force groups during that meeting to address each issue . 
After several heated <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> meetings , each attended by more than 70 <ORGANIZATION>BSA</ORGANIZATION> members , <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> members began to discuss and implement bylaw changes by <DATE>March 1</DATE> . 
One bylaw aimed to ensure that jury pools were proportional to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's racial demographics . 
Another bylaw targeted over-long trial processes by requiring the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> to drop a pending case after 40 days of investigation , unless deemed " extraordinary " by the <ORGANIZATION>Executive Committee</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> also organized the <ORGANIZATION>Athletic Honor Liaison Association</ORGANIZATION> to provide better communication between athletes , faculty and Honor officials . 
In the semester 's final weeks , newly elected <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> members continued to investigate new bylaws and procedural reforms . 
Members also planned to reinstitute meeting protocol outlined in <LOCATION>Robert</LOCATION> 's Rules of Order to streamline next year 's <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> meetings . 
While the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> worked on bylaw reforms , the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> reevaluated its own system with a proposal to revise the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Standards of Conduct</ORGANIZATION> , which outline impermissible behavior for <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students . 
Members drafted the proposal to clarify language and jurisdiction . 
The newly-elected <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> officially presented the revisions to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>General Council</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> and hopes to have <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> approval within the next year . 
The <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> also prided itself for receiving <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> approval on sexual assault procedures , taking in the <ORGANIZATION>University Mediation Service</ORGANIZATION> as an affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> and for re-implementing the <ORGANIZATION>Student Legal Defense Fund</ORGANIZATION> as a bail payment service . 
The <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> also made official an expedited trial process for violations concerning alcohol possession at <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> sporting events .
