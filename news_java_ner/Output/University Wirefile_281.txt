THROUGH all the political intrigues and partisan wrangling that have occurred in the gubernatorial election , it 's easy to forget that the lives of real people are going to be deeply affected by the outcome of the election on <DATE>Nov. 8</DATE> . 
People who care about the status of gay rights and a woman 's right to choose will be the Virginians most touched by the outcome of this election . 
It is crucial that anyone who is serious about these issues makes their voices heard at the ballot box tomorrow . 
Over the course of the campaign it has become clear the two candidates have staked out clear ground on the future of gay rights . 
Under the moniker of protecting " <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Values " <PERSON>Jerry Kilgore</PERSON> has made his opposition to the expansion of gay rights an issue in this campaign . 
On his Web site <PERSON>Kilgore</PERSON> proudly claims that he " opposes gay marriage and civil unions for same-sex couples . " 
Additionally , <PERSON>Kilgore</PERSON> has been quoted by the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Blade as saying that he opposed the <ORGANIZATION>monumental Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> decision in <LOCATION>Lawrence v. Texas</LOCATION> that forbade laws that would allow states to imprison citizens who participated in same-sex relations . 
While these policies may be a good vote winner in some sections of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> it clearly represents <PERSON>Kilgore</PERSON> 's opposition to the equal right for members of the LGBT community . 
With this in mind it is clear that <PERSON>Kilgore</PERSON> victory would guarantee that the rights of LGBT citizens of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> would not be protected . 
While no Democratic candidate could have a radically progressive platform in a conservative state like <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Tim Kaine</PERSON> promises to take concrete steps to ensure that the rights of members of the LGBT community will be protected in the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> . 
An article in the <DATE>June 24</DATE> issue of the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Blade stated that , " <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> spokesperson <PERSON>Jeff Kraus</PERSON> said in an e-mail that <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> supports equal treatment of gays and lesbians , has publicly supported including sexual orientation in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's employment anti-discrimination legislation , and opposed <ORGANIZATION>House Bill 751</ORGANIZATION> , the Marriage Affirmation Act , a measure that he says unconstitutionally limits the rights of gay Virginians to enter into private contracts . " 
In this way , <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> 's opposition to discrimination and a constitutional ban on gay marriage will act as a check on the worst of the anti-gay demagogues in the state legislature . 
While the gubernatorial election offers a clear choice on gay rights , it also provides the voters with two distinct positions on a woman 's right to choose . 
Although <PERSON>Kilgore</PERSON> has refused to take a stand on the legality of abortion , he has promised to take initiatives that would gravely impact women 's reproductive freedoms . 
Most importantly , a <DATE>Sept. 23</DATE> article in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post pointed out that <PERSON>Kilgore</PERSON> 's aides have confirmed that he stands behind a <DATE>2001</DATE> statement saying that he " supports exceptions for rape and incest if the woman reports the crime to police within a week . " 
With <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's legislature still threatening to introduce Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers ( T.R.A.P. ) legislation it is crucial that Virginian 's not have an anti-choice governor like <PERSON>Kilgore</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> . 
If the legislature were able to pass T.R.A.P legislation it would introduce regulations on abortion providers that would effectively shut down all but two of the state 's providers . 
If these measures were put into place , the majority of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's four million women would have virtually no access to abortion practitioners , and would effectively be denied their right to choose . 
Although <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> has expressed his own moral concerns about abortion , he has promised to adopt a policy that would seek to limit the number of abortions while still preserving women 's reproductive rights . 
He has articulated this vision in a four point plan that included promises to expand access to contraception and promote adoption as an alternative to abortion . 
In the end , the election on <DATE>Nov. 8</DATE> will have a tremendous impact on the future of gay rights and reproductive freedoms . 
Anyone who cares about these issues has the chance to take action for these issues , by making their voice heard at the ballot box tomorrow .
