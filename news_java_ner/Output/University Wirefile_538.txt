President <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> addressed the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> on how the administration plans to respond to rape , alcohol abuse , danger at fraternity parties and other key issues brought to light in a recent Rolling Stone article . 
The conference was closed to media , but live-streamed on the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> website . 
In her address , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> emphasized that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's new policies will concern the investigations of rape allegations rather than the reputation of the school and its administration . 
" How we answer these questions is not about protecting the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's reputation - it is about doing the right thing , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" We will not be doing business as usual in <DATE>Spring 2015</DATE> . " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said she was heartened by the passionate response of the community " to condemn the evil acts that have been reported . " 
She also highlighted the faculty-wide sexual assault training the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will incorporate into its policies , citing the Green Dot program at the <ORGANIZATION>University Women 's Center</ORGANIZATION> and the " Victim 's Bill of Rights " authored by department of psychology faculty <PERSON>Joseph Allen</PERSON> . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said she has discussed with <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON>Timothy Longo</PERSON> how the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> can better engage with law enforcement . 
" One thing we know for sure is that survivors need support , and we need to provide it to them , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" But we also a need a culture in which reporting is valued and supported by everyone who has contact with a survivor . 
Every faculty member and every staff member is going to learn how to do this . " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> condemned the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's binge drinking culture and discussed collaboration with Greek organizations , ADAPT , the <PERSON>Gordie Center</PERSON> , and other groups in developing alcohol use policies . 
" Women and men should know what they are drinking and who is serving it to them , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" Alcohol does not cause rape , but alcohol is often the tool of a predator . " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> also addressed the outcry among community members for an end to Greek life on Grounds . 
" In any crisis it can be far too easy to paint with a broad brush , and blindly attack entire groups of individuals . 
This is not a responsible reaction . 
It is not fair to fraternity men here who are good and decent people and are just as horrified as we all are about these disgusting allegations and revelations , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" Moreover , rapes and other sexual assaults occur in apartments , in public venues , and more rarely , in residence halls . " 
Social activities have been suspended at all fraternities until next semester while <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> leaders work with " leaders of Greek life to craft new contracts that provide greater safety for all of their guests during their activities , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> also plans to include unarmed security personnel around the Corner and Wertland Street areas on weekend nights and provided funding for the Women 's Center to hire another trauma counselor . 
" It is time for an open discussion about whom we will and will not tolerate among members of this community , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> cited the importance of student self-governance at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , but said student involvement in sexual assault trials was " controversial . " 
" It is important that students consider carefully whether this is still the correct approach , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> noted that rape is a national problem , but the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> must drive institutional changes in college sexual assault . 
" Our university has been placed at the center of this crisis , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" We will not shrink from it ; we will lead . " 
She concluded her address by advocating for student safety in order to improve the educational environment of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Our mission is to deliver a great educational experience , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
It " can not succeed if students are not safe . "
