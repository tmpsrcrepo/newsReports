<PERSON>John Pappas</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily Students learned more about the Green Dot program tailored for the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
The Green Dot Program held its launch event at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's Amphitheatre <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in an effort to familiarize the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community attendees with the program and to gather information on sexual assault bystander intervention . 
The program aims not only to train students to become better bystanders but also to encourage community engagement and mobilization against sexual assault and violence . 
<PERSON>Nicole Thomas</PERSON> , prevention coordinator for the Office of the Dean of Students , said the program was specially tailored for <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> in order to allow more student involvement and build upon faculty and staff participation . 
" It 's really about meeting people where they are , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said . 
" A lot of bystander intervention programs ask for people to step in no matter what and to kind of be this super hero or a vigilante . 
What 's great about <ORGANIZATION>Green Dot</ORGANIZATION> is that it says that you 're going to have barriers to intervening - everybody does - and instead of just trying to ignore or figure out how to solve them , it really teaches people ways to know what they are and then to choose other avenues of intervention . " 
The launch included different stations where attendees could share personal experiences , discuss barriers to intervention and talk about measures that could be taken in order to be a more proactive bystander . 
" It 's this mentality that nobody has to do everything but everyone has to do something , so people are getting involved and deciding to give some of their time , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> , project coordinator in the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs , said the launch was intended to let people within the community really understand what <ORGANIZATION>Green Dot</ORGANIZATION> is . 
" It 's community interventions , relational interventions and individual interventions , " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said . 
" To put that in context , a lot of other prevention programs that come through try to do those things , but they try to do them in either 45 minutes or they focus on one of the areas of the model ... which is a lot of talk and not a lot of action . " 
<PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said faculty and staff will also be involved with the program , a factor which will hopefully expose students to issues of sexual violence on a smaller , less intimidating scale . 
" Not everybody is going to take intro to gender studies , " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said . 
" So how do you expose them to issues of gender equality , social inequality , issues of violence without having to hijack a whole curriculum ? " 
Over a hundred students , faculty and staff were trained through Green Dot in <DATE>January</DATE> , and 63 students have been trained since then . 
<PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said project coordinators are also organizing an abbreviated version of the training program to be completed by additional faculty and staff over the <DATE>summer</DATE> . 
" I think that the [ faculty members ] who have been really engaged really appreciate that the invitation was extended , so that this was something much larger than just a student initiative or something that the Office of the Dean of Students was doing , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Green Dot</ORGANIZATION> was chosen over other bystander intervention programs because of research demonstrating its positive effects . 
" It is one of the most well-researched programs , " <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> said . 
" We 're seeing researchers looking at communities where <ORGANIZATION>Green Dot</ORGANIZATION> is and they 're seeing a 40 or <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> reduction in violent instances . 
We liked it because it 's not just something at the college level - we can eventually get community folks involved and eventually get middle and high school folks involved to really span more of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> . " 
Assistant Dean of Students <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> said she has been working with <ORGANIZATION>Green Dot</ORGANIZATION> for a few years , and oversees <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> ' coordination . 
" My excitement for this program in particular is that it 's not just about training people to be better bystanders and it 's not just about training students , " <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> said . 
" It 's about a community mobilization effort from faculty , staff and students from across the board to really change the culture of the institution . 
My hope is that we actually do change our culture . "
