<PERSON>Joseph D. Morrissey</PERSON> , I-Henrico , was indicted <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> on four felony counts just weeks after surrendering his seat following a misdemeanor conviction for taking " indecent liberties " with his 17-year old receptionist . 
<PERSON>Morrissey</PERSON> , who is also known for a <DATE>1993</DATE> courthouse fistfight with another lawyer , was reelected in a special election earlier this month as an Independent . 
He resigned his seat in the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> as a Democrat when details of the alleged sexual misconduct first emerged . 
Morrissey 's lawyers circumvented the prosecution 's efforts to find him guilty of much graver crimes - child pornography and soliciting a minor - during his first trial . 
Producing a child support agreement penned for the woman , who is pregnant , <PERSON>Morrissey</PERSON> claimed he was providing legal advice , not sex , to the minor . 
Last week , however , a grand jury indicted the state politician on four felony counts , saying <PERSON>Morrissey</PERSON> forged those documents , lied under oath , and persuaded the girl 's mother to lie in court . 
The mother has been indicted with three felony counts , with similar charges of forgery and perjury . 
Morrissey can reduce his six-month sentence of contributing to the delinquency of a minor by earning " good time " credit every day he serves in the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> . 
He spends his nights in jail . 
House Speaker <PERSON>William J. Howell</PERSON> , R-Stafford , has stripped <PERSON>Morrissey</PERSON> of his committee assignments . 
<PERSON>Howell</PERSON> said in a statement the new charges may lead <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>House of Delegates</ORGANIZATION> to pursue more sanctioning options for <PERSON>Morrissey</PERSON> . 
" This is a truly painful and embarrassing chapter for the oldest continuously operating legislative body in the new world , " <PERSON>Howell</PERSON> said . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> will evaluate these new indictments as it pertains to disciplinary action . 
As I have said before , we are considering all options as we determine the appropriate path forward for the <ORGANIZATION>House of Delegates</ORGANIZATION> as an institution and the Commonwealth of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . "
