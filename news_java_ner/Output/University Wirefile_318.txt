WITH THIS year 's election just around the corner , Democratic leaders are already claiming a victory and , according to <ORGANIZATION>Fox News</ORGANIZATION> , are supposedly choosing which offices to occupy in the Capitol building . 
But a closer look at the last few years shows why the Democratic party will ultimately fail this <DATE>November</DATE> . 
After all , Democrats would not be elected if they said the Republican party did everything right . 
Democrats have focused extensively on character attacks such as the " macaca " incident here in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . 
Let 's be very clear : Should <PERSON>George Allen</PERSON> have used the term " macaca " in reference to a minority student ? 
No . 
Would <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> have said it if he knew it was a racial slur ? 
Of course not . 
Yet has this been a focus of the Democratic campaign ? 
Naturally , since they know <PERSON>Jim Webb</PERSON> is wholly unqualified to be a senator . 
Playing up <PERSON>Webb</PERSON> 's military service and calling his 11-month stint as secretary of the navy a critical leadership position may sound nice , but it 's really just a cover for lack of experience . 
At the same time , <PERSON>Webb</PERSON> 's campaign ironically lambastes <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> for bringing up disturbing passages in some of <PERSON>Webb</PERSON> 's novels , despite the fact that <PERSON>Webb</PERSON> himself first characterize himself as a novelist . 
In the <ORGANIZATION>Richmond Times-Dispatch</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> notes that " <PERSON>Webb</PERSON> 's writings demean women , " and as The Cavalier Daily reported last <DATE>Monday</DATE> the novels content allegedly " includes descriptions of pedophilia and incest . " 
<PERSON>Webb</PERSON> 's response to this ? 
Again to ridicule <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> 's lack of military service rather than address real issues . 
This situation is similar to the other ace in the Democratic hand : foreign policy . 
Democrats have attacked the war in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> , for example , yet clearly their description of failure biases their judgment . 
After all , did we not remove a brutal dictator who killed tens of thousands of his own citizens ? 
Anyone who has opened a history book knows war is not a simple thing and that rebuilding a country is a long and difficult process . 
The bottom line here is an easy one : Would the Iraqi people be better off under <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> ? 
Moreover , voters must ask themselves : Do the Democrats have a better plan , or are they just looking for something to yell about ? 
Democrats across the board have also criticized the Republican handling of <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> -- ironically this time getting upset that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is trying to act multilaterally . 
Yet take a closer look and you will note that <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> has been and is backed by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , which despite relaxing its hardliner communist stance in the past decade or two , is by no means a democracy . 
It is only with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> in mind that the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> can have a real impact on <LOCATION>North Korea</LOCATION> . 
Finally , what should be the most important issue in this election campaign and what has been the biggest Republican success in recent years is a success which Democratic candidates threaten to undo . 
Despite wars in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> , the threat of terrorism and instability in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> , the Republican controlled <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> have done the impossible and provided strong economic growth . 
Unemployment , for instance , recently hit a historic low . 
As <PERSON>Edward Lazear</PERSON> , chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Council of Economic Advisors</ORGANIZATION> , reported to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Budget Committee</ORGANIZATION> , " the economy has been producing roughly 1.5 to <MONEY>2 million</MONEY> jobs per year for a total of 5.7 million additional payroll jobs since <DATE>August 2003</DATE> . " 
Gross Domestic Product has also grown considerably , primarily due to the <DATE>2003</DATE> cuts on capital gains and investment taxes . 
As <PERSON>Lazear</PERSON> notes , " Lower tax rates enable workers to keep more of their earnings , stimulating work effort and labor force participation . " 
In addition , the cuts promote further expansion of the economy . 
According to the report , private investment decreased " at an average rate of <PERCENT>6.7 percent</PERCENT> " in the two years prior to the tax cut , yet in the three years since has increased " at an average rate of <PERCENT>6.1 percent</PERCENT> . " 
Finally , and perhaps most importantly to consumers , the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> productivity rate is at a historic high of three percent . 
This is important because productivity is closely linked to real wages and thus standard of living " and is a key measure of our international competitiveness . " 
These factors have " made our economy the strongest and most robust in the world . " 
Take a look at the real issues affecting Americans , and it is clear that the past several years of Republican control have been a success . 
Americans are better off all around and can be confident in a strong economic future if current policies are continued . 
Though Democratic opponents blindly attack <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's foreign policy , we nonetheless accomplished what we set out to do in removing a brutal madman . 
Finally , as the election in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> will no doubt show , shadow games and character attacks do not hide a lack of experience and will ultimately alienate voters . 
Perhaps the Democrats should not be picking their offices just yet . 
As President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> pointed out in regards to <DATE>2004</DATE> election , Democrats then were doing the same thing , yet " the movers never got the call . "
