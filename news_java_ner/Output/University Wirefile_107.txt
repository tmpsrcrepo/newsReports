In <DATE>1997</DATE> , blacks made up about <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's population but about <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of arrests for major felonies such as rape and murder . 
These statistics , confirmed by a report scheduled for release later this week , show blacks are disproportionately represented in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's criminal justice system . 
The report , commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Advisory Committee</ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Commission on Civil Rights</ORGANIZATION> , will not be issued officially until <DATE>later this week</DATE> , but it was obtained <DATE>Monday</DATE> by <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> . 
As a proportion of arrests for all crimes , the disparity is slightly smaller , but at <PERCENT>42 percent</PERCENT> , blacks still are significantly over-represented . 
Beyond simply assessing the inequities that have been found in arrests and sentencing , the report extends its scope to a critique of police practices such as racial profiling . 
" It is obviously a national concern , " said <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Law School</ORGANIZATION> Prof. <PERSON>Robert O'Neil</PERSON> , a former <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> president . 
<PERSON>O'Neil</PERSON> said he hopes that the report will help law enforcement officials and policy makers to " go beyond pointing fingers " and have a candid discussion of controversial issues like racial profiling . 
Difficulties in the relationship between race and the criminal justice system is " old news , " said African-American Affairs <PERSON>Dean M. Rick Turner</PERSON> . 
" I hope [ the report ] will serve notice that this is a major problem , " <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said , adding that the real impact of the report would depend on how law enforcement officials react to it . 
He said he also believes while the issue of race in law enforcement is a large societal problem , he also feels that " we 're fortunate to have one of the more professional police chiefs " at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
He particularly cited the diversity of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> police department as one of its strengths . 
But " I have n't been as pleased " with the city and county police , he said , adding that he hopes to see more city and county cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> police . 
While the report clearly has given Virginians something to discuss , <ORGANIZATION>University Law</ORGANIZATION> Prof. <PERSON>Bill Stuntz</PERSON> said , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's arrest statistics for blacks are actually less disproportionate than the national average . 
This data is actually " favorable to the state , " <PERSON>Stuntz</PERSON> said . 
He also said the disparity can not all be blamed on the law enforcement community . 
Statistically , blacks have lower incomes and one might expect less affluent sections of the population to commit more crimes , he added . 
Whatever the cause , however , <PERSON>Stuntz</PERSON> said the disproportion remains " a large social problem . "
