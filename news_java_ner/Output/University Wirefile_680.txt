Akash Khungar | The Cavalier Daily " The <ORGANIZATION>Black Flag Advocacy Campaign</ORGANIZATION> is a way to break the stigma , " <PERSON>Trickey</PERSON> said . 
" Suicide is not something that anyone wants to talk about , even though the ripple effect of a suicide affects everyone . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter of To Write Love on Her Arms placed 1,100 black flags on the <LOCATION>South Lawn</LOCATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> to represent the 1,100 college students who die by suicide every year . 
TWLOHA is a nonprofit organization seeking to fight the stigma surrounding mental health , create a " better and safer " conversation about mental health and educate and inform people about the importance of receiving treatment . 
With the help of the Z Society , TWLOHA placed the black flags , both to respect student lives lost to suicide and to raise awareness . 
TWLOHA Vice President <PERSON>Arianna Trickey</PERSON> , a Curry graduate student , said the campaign is a way to bring attention to the conversation surrounding mental health . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>Black Flag Advocacy Campaign</ORGANIZATION> is a way to break the stigma , " <PERSON>Trickey</PERSON> said . 
" Suicide is not something that anyone wants to talk about , even though the ripple effect of a suicide affects everyone . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>Black Flag Campaign</ORGANIZATION> 's goal is to encourage students struggling with their mental health to seek the medical attention they need . 
" That being said , it 's not meant to be a bandwagon , " <PERSON>Trickey</PERSON> said . 
" It 's part visibility , but we 've also made sure that resources are available . 
We want to stress that suicide is not the answer - there are other avenues to get help here at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . " 
Trickey also explained the purpose of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter of the organization . 
" As an organization we try to do a lot of advocacy work to end the stigma and discuss what being a college student in a culture that stigmatizes mental health is , " <PERSON>Trickey</PERSON> said . 
" We 're trying to show that U.Va . 
is not alone in this problem , and that there are so many people who have faced these issues . " 
The main goal of <ORGANIZATION>TWLOHA</ORGANIZATION> is to educate and advocate for people struggling with mental health . 
Ten percent of students have depression , and an estimated two-thirds of those students are untreated , <PERSON>Trickey</PERSON> said . 
TWLOHA aims to connect people to the resources they need to combat mental health problems . 
" One of the things we have to stress is that we are not a support group , " <PERSON>Trickey</PERSON> said . 
" We are a group of individuals dedicated to helping students at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> getting the help that they need ... at the beginning of the semester , we created a document of every resource that we could possibly think of that a student could use , covering depression to eating disorders to anxiety to sexual assault . " 
Last semester , TWLOHA hosted <ORGANIZATION>National Suicide Prevention Week</ORGANIZATION> on grounds , and the Z Society commended the chapter 's hard work by sending the organization a letter . 
" We had to dig through the stacks to find it , and the letter was discussing that they really appreciated the efforts we had made to bring hope to the students at the university , " <PERSON>Trickey</PERSON> said . 
" They offered us resources to continue this . "
