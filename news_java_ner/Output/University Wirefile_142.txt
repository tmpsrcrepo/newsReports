Responding to concerns about a possible backlash against students with <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern</ORGANIZATION> backgrounds , many groups around <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> have discussed over the two days since the terrorist attacks ways to combat such reactions . 
Between 9 and 9:30 <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night a message went out to several organizations ' e-mail lists announcing a gathering in <ORGANIZATION>Newcomb Hall</ORGANIZATION> , beginning as soon as they could arrive , for students fearful about such a backlash . 
By <TIME>10 p.m.</TIME> , a large circle of people had convened in the <LOCATION>Commonwealth Room</LOCATION> , including <PERSON>Deans</PERSON> of Students <PERSON>Pablo Davis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ajay Nair</PERSON> , Counseling and <ORGANIZATION>Psychological Services</ORGANIZATION> representatives <PERSON>Russ Federman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Julia Routbort</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Terri Moore of University Career Services</ORGANIZATION> , and a cross-section of student organizations ' members . 
Some <DATE>two hours later</DATE> , weary from the nightmarish day , students and administrators filed out of <ORGANIZATION>Newcomb</ORGANIZATION> having voiced early concerns and decided on protective steps they would take . 
One of the first plans to develop was a large-scale meeting <TIME>last night</TIME> among members of the <ORGANIZATION>Arab Students Organization</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Muslim Students Association</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Persian Cultural Society</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Afghani Students Association</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Indian Students Association</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Pakistani Students League</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>South Asian Leadership Society</ORGANIZATION> . 
At <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> 's meeting , <ORGANIZATION>MSA</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Sana Khalid</PERSON> and ASO President <PERSON>Yahya Fouz</PERSON> promoted support outlets for students who believe people may somehow associate them with the terrorists behind <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> 's violence . 
" We 're not trying to scare anyone at all , but the point is to make everyone aware " of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's resources , <PERSON>Khalid</PERSON> said . 
" What we 're trying to do here is just keep a network going . " 
Though no serious incidents of harassment had been reported to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> officials yesterday , <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern</ORGANIZATION> immigrants and visitors -- and American citizens with similar ethnicities -- around the country have faced incidents of verbal harassment , vandalism and physical violence . 
Some common threads in student comments at both meetings included the objection to being lumped together as one people with the same views as the unidentified perpetrators of <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> 's attacks , and the two-fold burden many feel in responding to these events both as grieving Americans and apprehensive minorities . 
Routbort sent attendees of <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> 's meeting information about a variety of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> resources through an e-mail that detailed the minutes of that meeting . 
Attendees of <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> 's meeting received a flyer with contact information for these resources . 
Concerned or threatened students can call 911 to reach <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> or <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> police ; e-mail abuse@virginia.edu to report threatening e-mails , call the CAPS hotline , or contact the leaders of all the represented student organizations and the Office of the <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Students</ORGANIZATION> . 
Several professors will also lead an educational " teach-in " forum tonight , open to all students , consisting of speakers from the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> Studies program . 
The forum will take place in room 402 of <ORGANIZATION>Wilson Hall</ORGANIZATION> at <TIME>7 p.m.</TIME> Professors <PERSON>Abdulaziz Sachedina</PERSON> , <PERSON>Elizabeth Thompson</PERSON> and <PERSON>William Quandt</PERSON> are expected to speak . 
One aspect of the crisis that some students consider unfortunate is what they see as prevalent bias in the American media . 
At the <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> meeting , <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> cautioned that everyone should be critical of the media 's framing of these events , such as the immediate assumption that <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> was " at war " and " under attack . " 
<PERSON>Nebil Hussen</PERSON> , a first-year College student and <ORGANIZATION>ROTC</ORGANIZATION> cadet , pointed out that it was difficult to ask a community to separate the killers from the citizens of the countries they may be from after President <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> 's <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> night speech . 
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said " we will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbored them , " which , to many , implies military action against students ' home states . 
Young women who wear their hejab , or head scarves , as a part of their faith said they automatically receive attention . 
Others said they have heard " ignorant comments " made in social situations and had to decide whether to speak up . 
Students who live in <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> housing can expect opportunities for discussions about ongoing events , facilitated by resident staff members . 
Fouz said that as a Resident Coordinator in <ORGANIZATION>Hereford College</ORGANIZATION> he has been facilitating such discussions . 
" I think it 's been very productive , " he said . 
Federman also pointed out <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> that personal relationships are a strong combatant of prejudice , stereotypes , and fear , saying that when people know someone who is affiliated with a targeted group , they are not as likely to react with ignorance or prejudice .
