We have survived the month since what pundits call the defining moment of the <ORGANIZATION>MTV</ORGANIZATION> generation/Bush administration by hanging flags , donating blood , giving to the rescue efforts and moving on with our daily routines . 
I suggest a little remembrance . 
Not just of what we lost on <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> , because that has been burned into our memories . 
No one can forget the TV images , lists of names , frantic calls to friends and family in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> Nonetheless , we must not forget what was important The Day Before . 
At the personal level , people fell in love and broke up and found out they were pregnant . 
They made resumes and studied for tests . 
We continue to do these things because our emotions and bodies keep going and because we are pretty sure that next year still matters . 
We 're not living on the edge , really . 
We do need jobs , because Visa probably wo n't accept shock over the tragedy as an excuse for missing payment on credit card bills . 
Moving out to the next circle of our mental orbit , the one occupied by events that do not touch us directly , attention has narrowed and focused on issues relating to the attacks . 
In some respects , this is a good thing : The sooner we hear " Gary who ? " 
the better . 
And it 's too cold to worry about going swimming and getting attacked by a shark , anyway . 
The significant problems always have existed , of course , but now they 're on our front doorstep . 
We have to talk about terrorism ; we can no longer ignore it as we did when it was in <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> . 
Some items , however , should not slip off the agenda . 
They are too important to the values and way of life that we claim to defend . 
As vital as justice against terrorists and charity benefiting <LOCATION>New Yorkers</LOCATION> and Afghans are , we can not forget the importance of justice and charity for other people . 
Take the Sudanese . 
In the daily news reports of the <DATE>last month</DATE> , <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> has most often been mentioned as <LOCATION>Osama</LOCATION> bin <ORGANIZATION>Laden</ORGANIZATION> 's pre-Afghanistan hangout . 
What has been less often noted is the human rights situation in <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> . 
During a war that has killed more than 2 million people , the government of <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> has permitted , even encouraged , enslaving people from the southern part of <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> . 
Despite receiving little attention in the popular media , several members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> have made <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> 's troubles the subject of legislation -- seven bills during this session alone . 
Citing the need for information on bin Laden , however , the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration has moved toward lifting sanctions . 
Perhaps dealing with the devil -- or at least devilishly bad governments -- is indispensable at the moment . 
Yet our moral responsibility to the millions of Sudanese who have suffered murder , rape , enslavement and displacement remains . 
An unwillingness to ignore that prevented the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration from making a deal to take bin Laden out of <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> . 
Bin Laden has shot to the top of our priority list , but we need to recognize limits to what we can sacrifice even to capture a terrorist . 
After bin <ORGANIZATION>Laden</ORGANIZATION> is safely neutralized , we will regret any long-term agreement to support <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> 's present government . 
As the federal government concentrates on building alliances and striking against the Taliban , states may have to assume more responsibility . 
Thankfully , state legislatures appear to be carrying on with business as usual . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Virginia General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> , for example , did not cancel its <DATE>Sept. 12</DATE> meeting on health care policy , recognizing the need to evaluate the services provided to our most vulnerable citizens . 
Reviewing policy , though , is not the same as following the best course of action on it , and state legislators should be receiving guidance from their constituents . 
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> still have to choose governors on <DATE>Nov. 6</DATE> . 
Unlike the federal executive , governors seldom are called upon to make military decisions . 
Voters should be making choices based on a candidate 's ability to address the concerns specific to their state , not on his ability to wave flags and talk vaguely about past military experience . 
Although the attacks have changed <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , they can not set the course for all areas of our public life . 
After all , the original " defining moment " of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's presidency was supposed to be his decision on stem cell research , and the facts of that remain unchanged . 
There are still less than half as many cell lines as <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said there were ; the genetic diversity of the chosen cell lines has not increased in the last couple of months . 
As we look for a way to retain the sense of our nation as a community that was inspired by <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> , remember what was in our thoughts <DATE>Sept. 10</DATE> . 
Acting to help people in other nations and our fellow citizens , questioning and correcting our own errors -- these qualities , and not just our commercial or military might , define who we are . 
We can put our patriotism , generosity and intelligence to work in more ways than one .
