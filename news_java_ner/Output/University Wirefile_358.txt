<PERSON>Jack Ford</PERSON> , a former trial lawyer and award-winning anchor of CourtTV , addressed <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Law School</ORGANIZATION> students and faculty <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> regarding the impact of the <DATE>2006</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Duke University</ORGANIZATION> lacrosse case on the institutions of law and media . 
In his speech , <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> described the case as a " defining moment " for both law and media , comparing it to Watergate and the <ORGANIZATION>O.J. Simpson</ORGANIZATION> trial , which he covered in <DATE>1994</DATE> . 
The Duke lacrosse case exploded onto the media scene in <DATE>March 2006</DATE> , after a stripper accused three members of <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> 's men 's lacrosse team of raping her at a party held by the team captains . 
All charges were dropped , and the players were declared innocent in <DATE>April 2007</DATE> by <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON>Roy Cooper</PERSON> after chief prosecutor <PERSON>Michael Nifong</PERSON> falsely presented DNA information and failed to consider conclusive evidence from the defense . 
He was subsequently disbarred and found guilty of criminal contempt . 
Although <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> acknowledged that <PERSON>Nifong</PERSON> became a scapegoat for misplaced blame , he condemned <PERSON>Nifong</PERSON> 's unwillingness to consider other sides and his handling of the media . 
Ford described a permanent mistrust of prosecutors as an important consequence of media coverage and its depiction of the defense as heroes . 
He also advocated reevaluating the election process that judges experience , suggesting that the natural desire to preserve one 's career drives the decision-making process . 
" How do you make a tough call knowing it 'll be unpopular and that when it 's reelection time , your opponent will blow it out of proportion ? " 
he asked . 
Ford maintained that the resurgence of the notion of presumption of innocence and the reinforcement of opinion-based news were the two most significant consequences of the case . 
Presumption of innocence , which previously did n't exist among the general public , according to <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> , states that just because a defendant is charged does not mean he is guilty . 
With regard to the media , <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> described the lacrosse case as having cemented two trends : the intellectual frailty and lack of integrity of the media , as well as the reinforcement of opinion-driven news . 
" The ratings went through the roof , and opinion - and entertainment-based journalism drives ratings , " he said . 
" Ill-informed opinion is dangerously powerful , and early on , without any evidence or facts , many people jumped on the Duke lacrosse team and condemned the three young men , <ORGANIZATION>Duke University</ORGANIZATION> , lacrosse culture , everybody . " 
Third-year Law student <PERSON>David Mordkoff</PERSON> applauded what he described as <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> 's fair and interesting view of the case . 
" He brought a fresh approach to a case that 's been rehashed a lot over the years , " he said . 
Despite what <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> describes as the public view that the case highlighted everything that was wrong with the justice system , " it reassured me that the system has checks and balances to help protect people who are innocent , " <PERSON>Mordkoff</PERSON> said . 
" There 's a great majesty in what lawyers do . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> has served as a prosecutor , has taught at <ORGANIZATION>Fordham University</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Yale University</ORGANIZATION> , and has spent more than two decades as host of numerous TV shows , specializing in legal commentary . 
He has received two Emmy Awards and a <ORGANIZATION>Peabody Award</ORGANIZATION> among others . 
" He provides a variety of perspectives from his time as a lawyer and in the media , " <PERSON>Mordkoff</PERSON> said . 
" He 's a fantastic speaker . "
