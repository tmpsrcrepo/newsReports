Over the last four years , issues such as greater autonomy for higher education , sexual assault and diversity on Grounds have been the top issues facing <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> students . 
Higher Education Restructuring After two years of debating issues surrounding the restructuring of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> public institutions of higher education , the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> passed legislation <DATE>April 6</DATE> which officially outlines the path toward more autonomy for schools in the <LOCATION>Commonwealth</LOCATION> , including the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The recently passed legislation marks a move toward more independence for <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , which has maintained its status as a public institution since its founding . 
" We always intended to remain a public university true to <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> 's initial mission for this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , " <ORGANIZATION>University Spokesperson Carol Wood</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" We would have never walked away from our core mission as a public institution . " 
The push for autonomy in recent years has come in response to dwindling funding from the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> public colleges and universities . 
" If you look at the more recent history and the relationship between the state and higher education , the state has been faced with numerous budget priorities and higher education began to take a back seat to some other initiatives in the state , " Wood said . 
" There has been a steady decline in funding to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's budget and it became clear that this was not a trend that was going to turn around . " 
According to Wood , the major push for higher education restructuring in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> started <DATE>two years ago</DATE> . 
" This was n't on the radar screen <DATE>four years ago</DATE> , " Wood said . 
However , since the push for autonomy began , the legislation itself has changed . 
" The name did n't reflect what we were trying to achieve , " Wood said of the legislation , originally known as the Charter . 
" People were confusing it with other charter schools around the state and nation . " 
Other changes to the legislation include the creation of three levels autonomy available to <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> public colleges and universities . 
" During the process last year , the scope of what we were trying to do was broadened to include all of the public institutions of higher education in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , including the community college system , " Wood said . 
" The three levels of autonomy benefit all <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> public schools . " 
Changes in the legislation have also changed the role of the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> as well , said <PERSON>Alex Stolar</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Student Council Legislative Affairs</ORGANIZATION> chair . 
" The new version of the legislation increases the authority , " he said . 
" More importantly , that goes hand in hand with an increase in their accountability , which is ultimately good for students . " 
The support which the higher education restructuring legislation received from members of both parties in the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> and from the governor has encouraged students to support the legislation , too , <PERSON>Stolar</PERSON> said . 
" I think that students have come to realize that this is going to be very positive for higher education in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , " <PERSON>Stolar</PERSON> said . 
Sexual Assault While a " community of trust " lies at the foundation of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's identity , the issue of sexual assault at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has begun to challenge the reality of that trust . 
In the <DATE>Fall of 2004</DATE> , former <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Annie Hylton</PERSON> told her story of being sexually assaulted by a fellow <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student in the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> weekly newspaper , The Hook , and earlier this <DATE>spring</DATE> former <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Kathryn Russell</PERSON> shared her story with The Cavalier Daily . 
According to the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Sexual Assault</ORGANIZATION> Coordinator <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , student willingness to step forward marks a positive change in the issue of sexual assault and is indicative of a high level of student activism . 
" The biggest change [ concerning sexual assault at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> in recent years ] has been the level and degree of involvement on the part of students and activism on these issues , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
" To me that has been very exciting . " 
Additionally , student activism surrounding sexual assault played a role in the revision of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual assault policies and procedures this year , a process which occurs every three to five years , according to <PERSON>Shamim Sisson</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> chair . 
In <DATE>1999</DATE> , revisions to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual assault procedures included a split of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Judicial Review Board</ORGANIZATION> . 
Another revision to procedures in <DATE>2002</DATE> added structured meetings to sexual assault hearings , the informal resolution option and support to students who are declined prosecution by the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Attorney</ORGANIZATION> . 
The most recent revision , adopted this <DATE>spring</DATE> , included the addition of sexual misconduct and affirmative consent within the language of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual assault procedures and allows for a professionally conducted investigation in order to allow more strategic questioning by the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> . 
" 2004 and <DATE>2005</DATE> saw an unprecedented level of student interest and involvement in procedural revisions , " <PERSON>Sisson</PERSON> said . 
" The exciting aspect of that is the resulting procedures are markedly influenced by student input . " 
<PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> 's and <PERSON>Russell</PERSON> 's stories played an important role in calling an exceptional amount of attention to the issue of sexual assault at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" It takes a public event of some nature to get students angry and excited and educated about an issue , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
" That 's just how things are . 
This was the year for activism on this issue . " 
While <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has experienced a positive change in recent years in terms of raised awareness , sexual assault itself remains a problem within the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
According to <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> , the number of sexual assaults committed within the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community has not changed in recent years . 
Diversity <ORGANIZATION>The University</ORGANIZATION> has come a long way from its days of an all white male student body . 
The past recent years in particular have marked a time during which the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has made a concerted effort to increase diversity on Grounds and create conditions in which diversity can prosper . 
Despite University efforts , however , several racially motivated incidents that have occurred in the past four years indicate that there is much left to be done in terms of establishing and maintaining diversity on Grounds . 
" I 'm really disturbed about the climate , " said African-American Affairs <PERSON>Dean M. Rick Turner</PERSON> . 
" I 'm concerned because of the rash of racial harassment and abuse issues . " 
Among the racial incidents that have occurred at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> recently are the assault of former <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate <PERSON>Daisy Lundy</PERSON> on <DATE>Feb. 26 , 2003</DATE> and the vandalism -- which included the use of a racial epithet -- of fourth-year College student <PERSON>Amey Adkin</PERSON> 's car <DATE>Sept. 8 , 2004</DATE> . 
In part these incidents have helped to motivate further change and diversity efforts at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , including the President <PERSON>John T. Casteen</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>III 's Commission on Diversity and Equity</ORGANIZATION> formed in <DATE>Spring 2003</DATE> . 
" These incidents are primary reasons for the President 's <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said . 
" The climate stemming from what happened to <PERSON>Daisy Lundy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Amey Adkins</PERSON> was a primary reason to convene a task force . " 
Despite the unfortunate events of racial harassment , the incidents have brought a great deal of attention to diversity issues at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I think the change that has been of most importance is more awareness and acknowledgement , " <PERSON>Amey Adkins</PERSON> said . 
" U.Va . 
is a great and wonderful place , but we have issues . " 
One of the major changes resulting from the awareness surrounding the racial incidents and the President 's <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> have been efforts to create an incident report system , <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said . 
" Students will know where to go if they are the victims of racial harassment , " <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said . 
While <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> is making progress in terms of its response to incidents of racial harassment and bias , the fact remains that the incidents are occurring in the first place . " 
[ Incidents ] have become more common , " <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said . 
" There are a lot of unreported incidents , too . 
Students do n't want to report something that has happened to them because they do n't want their name in The Cavalier Daily and they do n't want their parents to know . 
They shrug it off . " 
The major change surrounding issues of diversity at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will require continued cooperation between the student body and the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's administration , <PERSON>Adkins</PERSON> said . 
" I think that we have come along way in the past four years and the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and the students have responded to these issues , " she said . 
" Especially with student self-governance , it 's important for students to take a stand , but we also need our leaders -- the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administration -- to be clear about these issues . "
