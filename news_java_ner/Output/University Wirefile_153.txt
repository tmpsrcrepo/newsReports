Ever since the marching suffragettes secured the vote for women , Aretha Franklin demanded some R-E-S-P-E-C-T , and <PERSON>Betty Friedan</PERSON> spurred the radical feminism of the <DATE>1970s</DATE> , the movement for women 's rights has seen a steady climb in all sectors -- especially in that of the workplace . 
Unfortunately , the rose-colored glasses of the past few decades just hit the floor and shattered . 
According to a recently released study commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION>General Accounting Office</ORGANIZATION> , women in top managerial positions continue to fall behind in earnings compared to their male counterparts . 
The current salary disparity proves that while women persist in slowly closing the gender gap , much more work is needed to put pressure on the nation to end discrimination fully against women . 
The idea of women 's rights has percolated throughout <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> since nearly the founding of the country . 
In over two centuries of existence , <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has passed a variety of laws to protect and advance opportunities for the female gender . 
The 19th Amendment provided the right to vote for women . 
Title IX of <DATE>1972</DATE> prohibited discrimination by sex in any education program or activity funded by the federal government . 
Relevant to the <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> 's study , <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> passed the Equal Pay Act in <DATE>1963</DATE> to bring the wages of women up to the level of men 's . 
Over the past several years and as recently as last year , the Fair Pay Act has been introduced several times to extend the work of the <DATE>1963</DATE> law . 
With the recently released data , though , it is obvious that these acts are not enough . 
The <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> 's study entitled " A New Look Through the Glass Ceiling : Where are the Women ? " 
reveals disturbing facts . 
Despite the economic explosion of the latter half of the <DATE>last decade</DATE> , women 's pay has failed to increase . 
In fact , in relation to that of men , their wages decreased . 
The study examined 10 major industries that employ women . 
In seven of those , women ended up receiving lower wages in <DATE>2000</DATE> than they did in <DATE>1995</DATE> . 
Additionally , half of the industries lacked a proportional relationship between the number of female managers and total women employees ( " Wage Gap Widens , " The Washington Post , <DATE>Jan. 23</DATE> ) . 
Almost all men and women in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> will stand up and say that they are in favor of women 's rights . 
The idea currently does not possess the negative connotation that existed during the bra-burning era of the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and <DATE>1970s</DATE> . 
In fact , the women 's movement has been tamed down to a level of common complacency -- everyone readily will claim to support it in principle , but few besides the <ORGANIZATION>National Organization for Women</ORGANIZATION> and a core group of passionate others now pursue hard action . 
Without a doubt , " A New Look Through the Glass Ceiling " will raise concerns and rightly so . 
The sponsors of the study , Rep. <PERSON>John D. Dingell</PERSON> ( D ) and Rep. <PERSON>Carolyn B. Maloney</PERSON> ( D ) , already have expressed their shock at the wide salary discrepancies that have worsened over the past several years . 
For example , a female communications manager in <DATE>1995</DATE> made about <PERCENT>86 percent</PERCENT> of the wages of that of a man in the same sector . 
But by <DATE>2000</DATE> , that number was hovering around the <PERCENT>73 percent</PERCENT> level . 
Other hotly debated women 's issues include abortion , maternal leave and sexual harassment . 
Wage increases also will be thrown into the fray soon . 
To address these topics sufficiently will require decided social and legislative action , which should include a revived push for the controversial Equal Rights Amendment . 
The ERA has been introduced in every session of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> since <DATE>1923</DATE> ; it was passed by the body in <DATE>1972</DATE> but failed to gain enough state support for its ratification . 
Such a powerful law would serve as an all-encompassing blanket for many women 's issues . 
Both the nation 's legislators and citizens must consider the ERA and other bills on the women 's agenda . 
The wage gap highlighted by the <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> must serve as a catalyst to once again bring women 's rights to the forefront of the nation 's political agenda . 
Over the past decade or so , <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has become used to the image of the " high-powered businesswoman , " and while such well-paid women executives do exist in what used to be the world of the " good ol' boys , " the path to full equality has yet to end . 
This nation 's women have come too far in breaking the shackles of discrimination to stop at any time before absolute victory .
