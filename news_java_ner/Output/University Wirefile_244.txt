TO : MR. <LOCATION>SANTA</LOCATION> Claus From : <PERSON>Jim Prosser</PERSON> , Student , <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> Mr. <PERSON>Claus</PERSON> , As millions of children petition you for the latest hot item of the holiday season , I 'd like to take this time to ask for some gifts myself . 
While I 'm sure that things like iPods and digital cameras top the list of many of my collegiate colleagues , I 'd like to be selfless this season and ask for a few things , both tangible and intangible , for the broader University community rather than just for myself . 
With that said , here 's my wish list of things I 'd like for the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community this holiday and for the ensuing semester ahead , in no particular order : * The removal of all ugly red walls surrounding construction projects . 
Especially those in front of <ORGANIZATION>Gilmer Hall</ORGANIZATION> . 
Come to think of it , <PERSON>Gilmer</PERSON> is uglier than the walls that surround it . 
Remove the building instead . 
* A new system for dealing with sexual assault and rape on Grounds . 
The stories that have emerged this semester of the inadequacies of the current apparatus are shocking . 
These matters are too grave for a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> kangaroo court to bungle . 
Instead , let law enforcement and courts settle the matters . 
Rapists belong in jail , not at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
* A pre-Christmas gift : a snowy lighting of the Lawn , as last year 's pre-lighting dusting was the most beautiful setting for the event yet . 
And free cider would be a nice touch as well . 
* A semester without a hate crime that fans the flames of racial strife at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Hopefully then we can make forward progress on issues of race , rather than having to react to the abhorrent events of the moment . 
* More professors and fewer deans and administrators living in the Pavilions on the <LOCATION>Lawn</LOCATION> . 
Mr. <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> wanted the Lawn to be a community of scholars , not of bureaucrats , no matter how hospitable they may be . 
In fact , let 's have it up to students to nominate and select new pavilion residents . 
* A men 's basketball team that will finally make the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> tournament for once in my four years at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>NIT</ORGANIZATION> will not be considered a sufficient substitute gift . 
* Speakers forums at the <ORGANIZATION>Miller Center</ORGANIZATION> that are actually scheduled at convenient times for students , rather than for the retirees that live adjacent to the center . 
Eleven in the morning just does n't cut it . 
Sure , we do n't donate money to the center , but it 's our school , and we should be taken into consideration . 
* New Student Council representatives who will agree to make public their votes on legislation before the body . 
Concealing such records erodes accountability to constituencies and is undemocratic . 
How about considering WWJD ( What Would Jefferson Do ) ? 
* A quality football bowl game for our hard-playing team , preferably one named after something other than <ORGANIZATION>Continental Tire</ORGANIZATION> . 
* Perhaps giving money as a present is crass , but a bigger wad from the state government this year would not be turned down . 
The amount we currently receive would make <LOCATION>Ebenezer Scrooge</LOCATION> cry of cold-heartedness . 
Perhaps the <ORGANIZATION>Ghost of University Future</ORGANIZATION> can pay a visit to the good governor . 
* The announcement of a commencement speaker who comes from outside the sphere of government . 
After having a governor , a former chair of the regional <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> bank and a <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> senator as speakers over the past three years , it 's time to go a different path this <DATE>spring</DATE> . 
I realize that most of these things ca n't be wrapped or dropped down a chimney . 
Many are gifts that require our work more than yours . 
Nevertheless , I hope that you can help us bring a spirit of giving and sacrifice to the community this year . 
We could sure use more of it these days . 
Always a believer , <PERSON>Jim Prosser</PERSON> ( C ) <DATE>2003</DATE> Cavalier Daily via U-WIRE
