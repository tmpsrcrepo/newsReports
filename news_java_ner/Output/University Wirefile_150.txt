Drugs , when used properly , can advance the field of science and medicine beyond what humans ever dreamed possible . 
There have been many drugs that , when manufactured and made available to the public , have saved and improved lives . 
On the other hand , when drugs are placed in the wrong hands , they can be a potent and deadly force . 
Those who abuse drugs often give the drug that they are using a bad reputation , and by doing so , they can cause the drug to become so taboo that it eventually is made illegal . 
This is exactly what happened to ecstasy , and it was wrong that the abusers of a controlled substance ruined the opportunity of access for those who actually needed the drug . 
Now that the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> has allowed scientists to continue in their research on ecstasy 's positive elements , the American public must not fight the legalization of it . 
Ecstasy is known in the medical field as <LOCATION>Methylenedioxymethamphetamine</LOCATION> , or MDMA . 
It is synthetic and it is considered a stimulant . 
If it is taken in strong enough doses , MDMA can cause hallucinations . 
Created in <DATE>1912</DATE> , it usually is taken orally and lasts for approximately four to six hours . 
While it is not extremely addictive , it still can be potent when taken abusively . 
Symptoms of an overdose on this drug are high blood pressure , tremors , seizures and heart attacks . 
In certain cases , an overdose can be fatal . 
In the <DATE>1970s</DATE> , ecstasy was not widely used as a recreational drug . 
Instead , psychiatrists had been legally using the drug for quite some time to help those with post-traumatic stress disorder . 
Rape victims , incest victims and veterans of war were able to uncover their repressed feelings through supervised use of the drug . 
Reportedly , those who had taken the drug experienced an expulsive moment , in which the inner stress was released in a burst . 
Thus , while these people would otherwise suffer from post traumatic stress disorder for their whole lives , the therapy coupled with this drug allowed them to get a fresh start . 
By the late '80s and early '90s , patients began distributing their prescriptions to others . 
This led to the eventual use of MDMA for recreational purposes , and it became the drug of choice for ravers , denizens of the late night techno club scene . 
As a result , the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> immediately banned the drug , and no further testing was done on its positive capabilities . 
This may soon change . 
Last <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> made the decision to allow people to test the drug as an aid in curing post-traumatic stress disorder . 
If approved by <ORGANIZATION>the Medical University of South Carolina</ORGANIZATION> , the tests conducted will subject 12 people to MDMA . 
The medical field ought to be commended , and the American public should support such efforts to legitimize MDMA . 
The bans on MDMA should be lifted in this country . 
Banning the drug only furthers its illegal transport across our nation 's borders . 
The mere fact that MDMA is an illegal and taboo drug adds to its appeal . 
Just as the end of Prohibition decreased organized crime by making alcohol legal in this country , ecstasy-related crime would decrease if the drug were legalized . 
If <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> acknowledges the drug 's capabilities to do positive things , a great deal of the mystique surrounding it would disappear . 
The more prominent reason why MDMA should be legalized is that permitting abusers of drugs to render them unusable for good is terrible precedent . 
At one time , this drug was used widely by many psychiatrists in therapy , and it was only banned from the market because of the drug abuse that occurred . 
There is no reason why a drug or any other human convenience ought to be taken off of the market due to the stupidity and irresponsibility of others . 
This is not fair to the traumatized victims who see this drug as an answer to their problems but are deprived of it because of a law that protects the weak and self-serving addicts among us . 
<PERSON>Lester Grinspoon</PERSON> , a professor of psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Medical School</ORGANIZATION> , speaks praise of MDMA , and says , " It enhances one 's capacity for insight and empathy , and melts away the layers of defensiveness and anxiety that impedes treatment . 
In one session , people can get past hang-ups that take six months of therapy to untangle " ( www.spiritplants.com ) . 
Nevertheless , the mere mention of the word " ecstasy " conjures negative images , and for the American public to continue thinking of MDMA as a bad thing is promoting a stereotype . 
There is a correct way and a wrong way to handle substances such as these . 
A line of distinction needs to be drawn between proper and improper uses of the drug , and only by doing this can the benefits of using MDMA for medicinal purposes be readily and widely accepted .
