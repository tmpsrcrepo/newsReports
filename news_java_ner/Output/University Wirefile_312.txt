A GENUINE open debate on sexual assault is a rare occurrence . 
After all , no one wants to appear apathetic about the crime or unsympathetic towards the victim . 
So when a person proposes harsher measures against sexual assault , many people who have reservations are reluctant to speak against the idea . 
Such is the case when a person proposes lowering the standard of evidence required to convict someone of sexual assault . 
On and off over the last several years , people have proposed that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> lower the standard of evidence to require only a " preponderance of evidence " for conviction . 
This proposal can look appealing at first glance , but a deeper examination of the proposal shows that it represents a serious threat to the rights of the accused . 
The progression of the argument goes something like the following : Sexual assault is a crime that hurts women . 
Many women report being sexually assaulted . 
Lately , few men have been tried and convicted for sexual assault . 
Therefore , the current system makes it too easy to for rapists to get away with sexual assault unpunished . 
Currently the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> , which is in charge of trying sexual assault cases at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , sets its standard for conviction as " clear and convincing evidence . " 
According to their Web site , this means that " the claim is highly probable and has produced a firm belief or conviction that the allegations in question are true . " 
Changing the standard to a " preponderance of evidence , " as some support , would require only that a bare majority of evidence points to the defendant 's guilt for a conviction . 
In some types of crimes , a preponderance standard could work . 
Sexual assault , though , is not a black and white issue . 
The reason for all the shades of gray is simple : drugs and alcohol . 
A study by <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> alumna <PERSON>Jacqueline Chevalier</PERSON> and <PERSON>Christopher Einolf</PERSON> , a member of the Sociology department at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , found a clear link between alcohol and sexual assault reports . 
According to this study , <PERCENT>92.6 percent</PERCENT> of the perpetrators and <PERCENT>83.2 percent</PERCENT> of the victims were using drugs or alcohol . 
It is fairly well known that drugs and alcohol impair both the memory and the judgment of their users . 
<PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> , chair of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> , said in an interview that in most of the cases " the sex act is acknowledged , and what 's debated is the consent . " 
Understandably , this factor can be difficult to determine when one or both of the parties was intoxicated . 
After waking up sober , a woman might not remember having consensual sexual intercourse that night after drinking . 
Since she does not remember giving consent to sexual activity , she could easily imagine she was raped.Virginia state law defines as rape any sexual intercourse " through the use of the complaining witness 's mental incapacity or physical helplessness . " 
Physical helplessness is fairly easy to determine , but it is much more difficult to know if the victim was mentally incapacitated . 
If she charges her partner with rape and it becomes a " he said , she said " situation with no other witnesses , how would the jury decide ? 
Discussing this sort of hypothetical situation , <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily</ORGANIZATION> writer <PERSON>Colin Clark</PERSON> ( " Looking for a safe stance on sexual assault ? 
Me Neither. , " <DATE>Oct 23</DATE> ) concluded that under the preponderance of evidence standard , " the man would probably be found guilty . " 
Are some rapists able to get away with their crime under the current policy ? 
Certainly . 
This is inevitable in any system of justice that follows the constitutional principle that suspects are innocent until proven guilty . 
There is an inherent trade-off between punishing more guilty offenders and protecting the rights of the innocent . 
Thus , lowering the standard of evidence in rape trials might lead to the conviction of more guilty defendants , but it will also punish more innocent defendants . 
As long as lenient attitudes towards premarital sexual activity coexist with alcohol consumption , there will be instances where the line between rape and consensual intercourse is unclear . 
This is not an attempt to blame the victim . 
The safety and welfare of women should always be protected , no matter how much alcohol or drugs they have consumed . 
However , concern for women 's safety does not give anyone an excuse to undermine the rights of the accused , and that is exactly what lowering the standard of evidence would do .
