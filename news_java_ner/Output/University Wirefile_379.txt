Democrats this year have embraced scare tactics designed to paint Republican <PERSON>Ken Cuccinelli</PERSON> as such a terrible candidate that Democrat <PERSON>Terry McAuliffe</PERSON> wins the race by default . 
The Cuccinelli that the Democrats have crafted is heartless , extreme , unacceptable and unelectable . 
The real <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> , however , is none of these things . 
He is passionate about policy and about people , he is experienced and he is by far <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's best candidate . 
<PERSON>Terry McAuliffe</PERSON> and his supporters have been trumpeting the narrative that <PERSON>Ken</PERSON> is " anti-women . " 
Ken has fought for the safety of women throughout his career in public service and since before he ever contemplated a career in politics . 
When he was a student at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> , a close friend was sexually assaulted . 
This painful incident motivated <PERSON>Ken</PERSON> to take action and demand that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> take steps to address the persistent problem of sexual assault . 
The massive protest which he helped organize on the steps of the <LOCATION>Rotunda</LOCATION> resulted in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> hiring its first ever sexual assault resource officer . 
He also helped establish Sexual Assault Facts and Education ( SAFE ) , a student group that continues to raise awareness about sexual assault , help prevent it , and provide resources for victims . 
As state senator and attorney general , <PERSON>Ken</PERSON> has pursued sex offenders , domestic assailants and human traffickers with as much vim and vigor as he fought sexual assault as a student here at Mr. <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> 's <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Ken has been a fighter for <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's most vulnerable , for the people that countless others in office would , and often have , overlooked . 
When it was brought to his attention as attorney general that new evidence could clear a man imprisoned for three decades , <PERSON>Ken</PERSON> immediately took action , investigated the case and fought for justice . 
<PERSON>Thomas Haynesworth</PERSON> is now a free man because of <PERSON>Ken</PERSON> 's actions . 
He has been compensated for the decades of life robbed from him by the state and at <PERSON>Ken</PERSON> 's urging he is now employed by the Office of the Attorney General . 
As attorney general , <PERSON>Ken</PERSON> has fought to secure <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> detainees the right to appeal their convictions in light of newly discovered evidence in their cases . 
In <DATE>2009</DATE> , <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> was the only Republican member of the <ORGANIZATION>State Senate</ORGANIZATION> to vote against an expansion of the death penalty . 
Ken has always had the courage to lead from principle , even when it defies party . 
Although <PERSON>Terry McAuliffe</PERSON> 's campaign slogan is " putting jobs first , " the Democratic nominee 's pathetic entrepreneurial record tells a very different story . 
When running for governor in <DATE>2009</DATE> , <PERSON>McAuliffe</PERSON> promised voters in <LOCATION>Martinsville</LOCATION> , among the hardest hit by the last recession , that he would bring jobs to their community . 
While he was n't elected governor , he had a more direct opportunity to do this as CEO of <ORGANIZATION>GreenTech Automotive</ORGANIZATION> . 
In fact , <LOCATION>Martinsville</LOCATION> was high on the list for potential plant locations . 
But <PERSON>McAuliffe</PERSON> instead chose to locate in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> , because that state offered him a " better deal , " in other words , a corporate handout . 
In <DATE>April</DATE> , <PERSON>McAuliffe</PERSON> 's former business partner <PERSON>Charles Wang</PERSON> revealed in the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Times that the aspiring gubernatorial candidate was no entrepreneur , but always a politician , seeking to build his business off of donations from Democratic millionaires . 
Wang even called people like <PERSON>McAuliffe</PERSON> " destructive for business . " 
This all goes back to the fact that <ORGANIZATION>Tricky Terry</ORGANIZATION> 's only background is as a Democratic party fundraiser . 
He has never been accountable to voters and he has never worked for <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's record . 
Why should voters trust him to start now ? 
Cuccinelli , in addition to having a strong record to run on , has a bold , comprehensive vision to move <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> forward . 
He will reduce the individual income tax rate from <PERCENT>5.75 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> and the corporate income tax rate from <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> to <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> , so that middle-class Virginians have more money in their pockets and small businesses will have the ability to create more jobs in our commonwealth . 
He 'll pay for these tax cuts by getting rid of tax deductions that only benefit powerful and well-connected millionaires - the kind of deductions that <PERSON>McAuliffe</PERSON> wo n't have the backbone to touch , lest he insult his wealthy donor base . 
Unlike <PERSON>Terry</PERSON> , <PERSON>Ken</PERSON> actually puts jobs , and Virginians , first . 
When he was running for president in <DATE>2008</DATE> , then-Senator <PERSON>Barack Obama</PERSON> said of negative scare tactics , " If you do n't have a record to run on , then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from . " 
McAuliffe does not have a record to run on . 
He has never held elected office and actually been accountable to voters . 
He has no leadership in service to the commonwealth . 
<PERSON>Ken</PERSON> has spent his lifetime as a leader . 
He has served the commonwealth admirably for more than a decade and has a clear vision on how to move <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> forward . 
Voters have a clear choice on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> . 
<PERSON>Peter A. Finocchio</PERSON> is a fourth-year College student . 
He is the vice chair of campaigns for the College Republicans and parliamentarian for the <ORGANIZATION>College Republican Federation of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> .
