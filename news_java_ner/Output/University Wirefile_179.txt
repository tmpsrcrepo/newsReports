According to national crime victimization statistics , a woman in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is 10 times more likely to be raped than to die in a car crash . 
Women between the ages of 16 and 24 are by far the most likely age group to be raped . 
<PERCENT>Twenty-eight percent</PERCENT> of women in college have experienced rape or attempted rape by the time they graduate . 
With sexual assault awareness week quickly approaching , many <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> groups hope to bring these statistics , and the availability of women 's health and sexual assault response resources on Grounds , to the forefront of student consciousness . 
The <ORGANIZATION>2002 Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations</ORGANIZATION> evaluation of the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Department of Student Health</ORGANIZATION> ranked the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> as one of the best student health care providers nationally . 
Student Health received a 99 out of 100 score . 
The <ORGANIZATION>JCAHO</ORGANIZATION> score includes all aspects of Student Health , and women 's health availability is one factor considered in the score . 
Student Health Gynecology currently staffs only one OB/GYN , <PERSON>Christine Pederson</PERSON> . 
<PERSON>Pederson</PERSON> , the clinic director and consulting physician , does not see students on an everyday basis . 
Five nurse practitioners , one triage nurse and medical students in rotation deal with regular student concerns . 
The student health insurance offered through the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Chickering Group</ORGANIZATION> , provides a generic and nongeneric copayment plan for medications , including emergency contraception such as Plan B . 
It covers <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> of the cost of any laboratory or diagnostic tests ordered through <ORGANIZATION>Student Health</ORGANIZATION> . 
As such , it does not fully cover medical treatment for sexual assault victims , such as forensic evidence collection , emergency contraception and prophylactic treatment for sexually transmitted infections . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> does not provide forensic evidence collection . 
This is not peculiar to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , but is rather indicative of a larger trend in women 's health resources at four-year public universities in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> . 
Of four national public universities compared by The Cavalier Daily -- the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>the University of Nebraska-Omaha</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>the University of Oregon</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>the University of Alabama-Tuscaloosa</ORGANIZATION> -- all provide some form of specialized medical care for women . 
Yet none staffs a full-time OB/GYN who sees patients on an everyday basis . 
No university health system considered has a <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner</ORGANIZATION> program to provide immediate medical response to sexual assault , such as forensic evidence collection , prophylactic treatment for STIs including HIV and emergency contraception . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , like many other institutions , sends students who seek these services to local emergency rooms in order to give them access to specialized nurses in the SANE program . 
" There 's no margin of error , they need to be handled right the first time . 
The nurses who do that need to be trained for that step-by-step , and we 're not trained to do that , " said <PERSON>Marcia Adler</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>the University of Nebraska-Omaha Student Health</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Most women who are raped do not seek medical attention in that initial 72-hour time period , " when evidence collection is possible , said <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , Coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Education Office of the University of Virginia Women 's Center</ORGANIZATION> . 
For whatever reason , medical sexual assault response is by protocol not handled within university health systems . 
What then are the financial implications for students seeking outside medical care ? 
" If you have the resources , you 're generally in good shape . 
For students who have limited resources , there 's a problem , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
Noting the current scarcity of financial resources in the midst of the statewide budget cuts , she added " it 's not likely that there are going to be more added on . " 
While " it 's certainly worth raising the question , ' Why is there only one M.D. over in GYN ? ' " 
the nurse practitioners usually can take care of routine women 's health concerns , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
" The people who are there are very good , but they are definitely short of nurses . " 
Still , <ORGANIZATION>JCAHO</ORGANIZATION> emphasized the stringent standards to which <ORGANIZATION>Student Health</ORGANIZATION> had to adhere in order to receive its high score . 
" A 99 demonstrates almost perfect compliance with all standards and a commitment to quality and safety , " said <ORGANIZATION>JCAHO Spokesman Mark Forstueger</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Comprehensive work with regard to emergency management and community collaborative activities is excellent . " 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> noted that future change in women 's health services remains possible , citing a student-led initiative in <DATE>2001</DATE> that led the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's health insurance plan to cover contraceptives . 
She added that if students organized for the development of women 's health resources , " it would be attended to in one way or another . "
