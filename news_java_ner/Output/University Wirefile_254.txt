While we students were on <ORGANIZATION>Spring Break</ORGANIZATION> , many of us found ourselves drawn in on <DATE>Friday</DATE> , <DATE>March 11</DATE> , to the story of <PERSON>Brian Nichols</PERSON> . 
<PERSON>Nichols</PERSON> , who was on trial for rape , had escaped from custody allegedly by grabbing a policeman 's gun , shooting and killing the judge , court reporter and another guard , then hijacking several cars and fleeing . 
As the case unfolded , the entire city of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> ( where the incident had taken place ) seemed to shut down as <PERSON>Nichols</PERSON> fled with nothing to lose . 
After all , he assuredly faced the death penalty if caught . 
Once again , the death penalty had failed to serve the people it was supposed to protect . 
The time is long overdue for Americans to reconsider the death penalty , recognize that this punishment fails in all its purposes and begin the movement towards the total abolition of the death penalty in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
While <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> remains one of the last remaining industrialized countries to still have the death penalty at all , its place here seems very firm . 
While parts of the death penalty are eroding ( we may no longer execute the mentally retarded , and , as of just a month ago , we may no longer execute juveniles ) , the death penalty itself unfortunately remains just as much a part of the American judicial system today as it was 200 years ago . 
The most frequent argument in support of the death penalty , for example , is that it deters criminals from committing crimes . 
This is simply untrue . 
In fact , according to the Uniform Crime Reports , the annual reports released that show crime rates across the country , death penalty states in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> actually have a higher murder rate than states without the death penalty . 
In fact , when <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> reintroduced the death penalty in <DATE>1990</DATE> , studies reported in Criminology magazine showed that there was a jump of an average of one additional stranger-homicide ( a person murdering someone they did not know ) per month . 
The death penalty had failed to serve as a deterrent , and it can even be argued that the death penalty served merely to re-introduce the acceptability of violence in society in <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> . 
Another argument in favor of the death penalty is the idea that a murderer should face the worst penalty possible . 
While this is certainly a reasonable argument to make , the flaw is the idea that the death penalty is the worst penalty possible . 
Spending the rest of one 's natural life in jail , contrary to what many will argue , is no picnic . 
Inmates have nothing to do with their lives but eat , exercise an hour a day and sit there and think about the mistakes they made . 
This is far more haunting and unpleasant than having it all come to an end in 10 to 15 years . 
Many argue that someone still in prison gets family visits , TV and still gets to live some semblance of a life . 
This kind of argument is not only mostly untrue , but also an argument for prison reform and not relevant to the death penalty . 
Finally , beyond the flaws in the logic supporting the death penalty , the death penalty itself has major drawbacks . 
The biggest one is that it is irreversible . 
If someone innocent has been wrongly convicted , this person no longer has any avenue of appeal if they are dead . 
Over the course of the past 30 years , for example , 119 death row inmates have been determined to be innocent and released . 
Some argue that these cases show the appeals system works , and we do n't actually execute those who have been wrongfully convicted . 
This also is untrue . 
A case discussed in the <PERSON>Thomas M. Cooley</PERSON> Law Review of <DATE>1997</DATE> was the <DATE>1990</DATE> execution of <PERSON>Jesse Tafero</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> for murdering a state trooper . 
Just <DATE>two years later</DATE> , it was discovered that the primary prosecution witness had perjured himself in the case , and <PERSON>Tafero</PERSON> 's wife ( who was convicted with all the same evidence of the same crime ) was determined to be not guilty of the murder . 
Had <PERSON>Tafero</PERSON> been alive in <DATE>1992</DATE> , he also would likely have been found not guilty . 
Instead , the state of <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> had already murdered <PERSON>Tafero</PERSON> . 
Murder is always wrong , and it is better to let hundreds of guilty criminals live in jail than to murder one innocent person . 
While the death penalty still holds an entrenched place in American society , it is time for the death penalty to be brought to an end . 
The sanction fails as a deterrent , fails as an effective punishment and risks the murder of innocent people . 
The death penalty has no place in the <DATE>21st century</DATE> . 
It is time for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to catch up with the rest of the world and abolish the death penalty .
