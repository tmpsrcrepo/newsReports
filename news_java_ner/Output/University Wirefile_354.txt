A remarkable thing happened last week in the great City of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> . 
The police arrested an individual suspected in two armed robberies that occurred last <DATE>Monday</DATE> . 
The suspect , an 18-year-old boy , approached university students on 14th and 15th streets , pulled out a gun , ordered them to the ground , and left with their wallets and cell phones . 
What makes this case remarkable is , sadly , not the taking of property or use of a handgun , but that the individual actually got caught . 
I find it ironic that the arrest received front page attention in The Cavalier Daily , while many of these types of crimes only get short blurbs within the paper . 
Maybe the reason for this cursory treatment of robberies is because the arrest is far rarer than the crime . 
We all get the e-mails from the <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> when crimes occur , and I know I am not alone in skimming for the location and then hitting the delete button . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police</ORGANIZATION> departments do not seem to understand their safety tips defy the realities of going to college . 
Whether we should walk alone or in dark areas , the reality is that we often have to . 
College towns need better surveillance , and the police departments should fill that role . 
In reading the article about the recent arrest , I was struck by <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> spokesperson <PERSON>Carol Wood</PERSON> 's comments about how students should stay safe : " There are a whole host of things that students can do to protect themselves . 
Let your roommate or your friend know that you 're going to be out late or walking in a certain area . 
Charlottesville really is a generally safe community , but you ca n't throw caution to the wind , so to speak , so you have to use good judgment . " 
What stuck me about this comment was the lack of understanding of college life . 
Informing my roommates that I will be walking home around <TIME>12:30 a.m.</TIME> on 14th Street will not prevent me from being robbed , murdered or raped . 
If they are not with me to either discourage the perpetrator or to fight him or her off , then informing them of my location will do only that . 
Also , <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> is not the haven we would all like it to be . 
According to Area Connect , an online directory of information for different localities , <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> had 826.8 violent crimes per 100,000 people in <DATE>2005</DATE> . 
The national average was 554.4 violent crimes per 100,000 people . 
And <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> looks even worse when the crimes are broken down into categories , with 94.3 rapes ( compared to the national average of 34.6 ) , and 533.2 aggravated assaults ( compared to the national average of 340.1 ) per 100,000 people . 
Clearly , <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> is not the safest of communities . 
Wood also suggested in the article that students should utilize <ORGANIZATION>UTS</ORGANIZATION> buses and Safe Ride to further protect themselves from becoming victims of crime . 
But buses stop running at <TIME>12:20 a.m.</TIME> on weeknights , and most importantly , they do not drop you off at your doorstep . 
Last year , there was a rash of robberies in <LOCATION>Lambeth Field</LOCATION> , and some of these occurred in the colonnade that students must walk through to get home from the bus stop . 
The locations of the most recent crimes , 15th Street , Wertland and <LOCATION>Jefferson Park Avenue</LOCATION> , are more susceptible to robberies because they are a bit of a walk from the closest bus stop . 
SafeRide is equally unreliable . 
According to <ORGANIZATION>SafeRide</ORGANIZATION> 's Web site , its objective is to transport individuals near the <PERSON>Alderman</PERSON> and <PERSON>Clemons</PERSON> libraries to locations within a one-mile radius of <ORGANIZATION>Newcomb Hall</ORGANIZATION> , and it will not provide transportation for drunken students , the students who need it the most . 
SafeRide has proven worthless to me countless times in the past . 
There have been times when I called , and no one even picked up . 
So , SafeRide is not the solution for increasing student safety either . 
Students are not inherently careless ; we do not intentionally " throw caution to the wind . " 
But when I get e-mails about crimes and never hear anything about arrests , it numbs me . 
Instead of continuously suggesting the obvious , police should increase surveillance of off-Grounds areas to prevent these crimes from occurring . 
<PERSON>Matt Schrimper</PERSON> , a College representative to <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> , agrees , adding that the university , " must work with the city to build well-lit pedestrian crosswalks and bridges over the railroads , develop a blue phone system in off-Grounds housing areas , and noticeably increase joint-department police presence , particularly on weekday nights . " 
All of these steps , none of which is drastic , could significantly deter crime and improve student safety in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> . 
The key to increasing safety is prevention . 
Though the tips provided by the university are reasonable , they are not a solution .
