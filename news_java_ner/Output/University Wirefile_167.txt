Both conservatives and liberals have been trying to politicize the molestation scandal surrounding the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> . 
Many in the former category accuse the church 's hard-line policies on sexuality and celibacy in the priesthood as being at fault . 
On the other hand , many conservatives have pointed out that because the majority of boys molested have been pubescent , and not pre-pubescent , that this is a case of homosexual rape and not pedophilia . 
Both sides have valid points -- however , very few on either side have come close to grasping the reality behind the situation . 
The popular solutions offered -- eliminate celibacy for the clergy , or prevent homosexuals from entering the priesthood -- are shortsighted and , at best , band-aids . 
The real problem lies in the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> 's schizophrenic treatment of homosexuality -- both its condemnation of homosexual acts , and its widespread recruitment of gays . 
Church doctrine teaches that before marriage , Catholics must lead a chaste life . 
Additionally , the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> teaches that homosexual orientation is not in itself wrong -- sidestepping the ridiculous " homosexuality is a choice " argument offered up by many other Christian denominations . 
But because homosexual marriage is not allowed , gays must therefore lead a life of celibacy . 
This is where the priesthood becomes an option . 
Because the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> recognizes that homosexuality is innate , but demands a chaste lifestyle , many see it as a call to the priesthood . 
Not only does the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> refuse to combat this perception , but many seminarians use it to their own advantage . 
As Catholic Dossier columnist <PERSON>James Hitchcock</PERSON> observed in the <DATE>March-April</DATE> issue , the testimonials of many priests " confirmed the suspicion that in some religious orders vocation directors vigorously , even exclusively , recruit homosexuals . " 
But the idea of the priesthood and celibacy as a safe haven for gay Catholics is dangerous . 
The motivation behind living this celibate life is not one of spiritual fulfillment , but rather that of repression . 
And celibacy , contrary to popular belief , is not solely about repression of sexual desire . 
According to Faithlinks.com , celibacy is " understood to require sexual continence in order to direct all energies toward the single-minded love and service of God . " 
In other words , celibacy is not about repression , it 's about finding bodily and spiritual satisfaction through a relationship with God . 
By entering the priesthood with these motivations , many priests are later faced with the psychological consequences of repressing their sexuality . 
Thus , due to the sexual repression , many of these homosexual priests stay sexually immature , with a sexual development comparable to that of a teen-ager . 
Or , as Rev. <PERSON>Edward Kaminski</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Monterey</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> , says in the <DATE>April 14</DATE> issue of the <PERSON>Santa Cruz Sentinel</PERSON> , " Lack of psychosexual development is what [ the abuse ] is all about . " 
This also explains the age of most of the victims of sexual abuse . 
Like conservatives have rightfully pointed out , most of the boys molested have been adolescent -- meaning that this scandal is more about homosexual rape than it is about pedophilia . 
But despite what some conservatives claim , the problem does n't lie with the insatiable sexual appetites of gay priests for young boys . 
Rather , the repressive attitude these homosexual priests take toward celibacy results in the absence of any sexual development . 
What the church is left with is an abundance of middle-aged priests with the sexual maturity of a teen-ager , suffering from sexual repression . 
Unfortunately , these priests are in a position that is naturally corruptible . 
Many priests work with adolescent boys , with whom they share a level of sexual maturity . 
However , because they are in a position of power over these boys , what these priests see as sexual experimentation is actually exploitation and molestation . 
The problem ultimately lies with the church 's teachings on homosexuality , celibacy and the priesthood . 
These teachings need not be changed , but the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> can not sit by and watch people enter the priesthood for the wrong reasons . 
Solutions such as prohibiting gays from serving in the priesthood or eliminating the requirement of celibacy from the clergy could reduce the molestation problem . 
These ideas , however , are shortsighted and only address the widespread sexual abuse on a superficial level . 
This is not to free the guilty priests from any responsibility for their actions . 
There are problems inherent in the Catholic doctrine and practice , and this scandal will continue until these are addressed .
