When <PERSON>Trent Reznor</PERSON> landed a Grammy for his work on the EP " Broken , " it was the beginning of a rise in popularity for industrial music artists . 
Nine <ORGANIZATION>Inch Nail</ORGANIZATION> 's <DATE>1994</DATE> follow-up to " Broken , " " The Downward Spiral " punctuated the belief by going triple platinum . 
Throw in <PERSON>Marilyn Manson</PERSON> 's success <DATE>two years later</DATE> , and the industrial movement was rolling . 
Apparently , it was rolling over a cliff . 
Since <DATE>1995</DATE> , <PERSON>Manson</PERSON> headed for the glossier side of rock and <PERSON>Reznor</PERSON> disappeared from sight . 
The Nothing Records label was n't the only place where industrial took a hit . 
Pioneers Skinny Puppy hung up their shoes following the death of band member <PERSON>D.R. Goettel</PERSON> . 
With the marquee industrial acts bowing out right and left , only one group was left to carry the standard . 
Industrial flag bearers Ministry alone could fill several books with their history . 
The duo progressed from heavily synthesized tracks in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> to thundering bass lines and sarcastic lyrics of the mid - <DATE>'90s</DATE> . 
Over the band 's career it has displayed little consistency , overhauling its sound on each successive CD . 
Its latest release , " Dark Side of the Spoon " is <ORGANIZATION>Ministry</ORGANIZATION> 's seventh studio album in 16 years , and the fifth under the lineup of frontman <PERSON>Alain Jourgensen</PERSON> and bassist <PERSON>Paul Barker</PERSON> . 
" Dark Side " reflects a blend of <ORGANIZATION>Ministry</ORGANIZATION> 's last five discs with a dash of new influences thrown in . 
The opening track , " Supermanic Soul , " uses a drum beat reminiscent of the band 's <DATE>1989</DATE> release , " The Land of Rape and Honey , " with vocal distortion from " Just One Fix " from the <DATE>1992</DATE> album " Psalm 69 . " 
The rest of the disc can be picked apart similarly , but the overall picture is amazing . 
Ministry incorporates influences long past , with its tendency to toughen its sound every three years . 
The current single from the disc " Bad Blood " is a fine example of the " Dark Side " 's offerings . 
The driving guitar rhythms woven seamlessly with basic drum loops and <PERSON>Barker</PERSON> 's hammering bass line serve as a backdrop for <ORGANIZATION>Jourgensen</ORGANIZATION> 's not-quite-screaming vocals . 
On " Step , " a jazz drum motif creates a humorous atmosphere for sarcastic lyrics about a rock star battling alcoholism . 
The line , " I 'd like to thank all my wonderful fans ... I wish I could take you all to the <ORGANIZATION>Betty Ford Clinic</ORGANIZATION> , " is a wonderful example of <ORGANIZATION>Ministry</ORGANIZATION> 's usual social commentary . 
The biggest surprise on the CD is a trio of tracks that compliment each other in a strange cycle . 
" Eureka Pile " is a slower song , but nonetheless heavy handed . 
Jourgensen sings halfway between narration and preaching accompanied by mysterious background singing . 
Its spooky sound sets an overtone for the entire disc . 
" Whip and Chain " is the second track , but likewise shows Ministry using slower paces and low frequency noise to increase the depth of its work . 
The chorus - " Do n't wan na feel okay , baby " - would have been uncharacteristic for the band in the past , but it fits in without a hitch here . 
Near the end of the CD , " Kaif " comes across as an emotional song for the anger-driven duo . 
The track 's bass resembles rolling thunder and is coupled with the rare sound of Jourgensen singing undistorted . 
" Kaif " sounds much like Skinny Puppy 's last songs , and with a chorus of " Where does the time go ? " 
the song may very well be addressed to the defunct industrial group , with whom <PERSON>Jourgensen</PERSON> had occasionally performed . 
Ministry has not made the usual progression between albums , opting to explore the realms it uncovered in previous works . 
The result is a refined sound that overshadows anything the band has done to this point . 
Ministry fans will enjoy the disc , because the band is both forging ahead by looking back . 
Some fans may claim that the deviation is commercial sounding , but a band ca n't sell out by copying their own work . 
With " Dark Side of the Spoon , " Ministry has ascended to the level of precious few hard rock bands , groups whose immense amount of creativity and thought can be heard in the music , rather than staying in the studio .
