The <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> state budget , student safety and a look at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> 's accomplishments and plans for improvement were main topics in University President <PERSON>John T. Casteen</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>III</ORGANIZATION> 's annual State of the <ORGANIZATION>University Address</ORGANIZATION> yesterday . 
The speech included topics proposed by various university groups and was followed by a student response organized by the Living Wage Campaign . 
Casteen opened by thanking those in attendance . 
He commended Chief Human Resources Officer <PERSON>Susan Carkeek</PERSON> for her efforts in creating the <ORGANIZATION>Workforce Development Program</ORGANIZATION> , which <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> said he hopes will help the university remain the " employer of choice in the region . " 
<PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> also spoke about <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's state budget , which is expected to give <MONEY>$ 225 million</MONEY> to public colleges and universities , primarily to support capital campaigns and financial aid programs . 
" Both nationally and statewide , people are recognizing the failure of the current financial aid system , " <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> said . 
He discussed the university 's growing dependence on endowments because of the decreased availability of state funds . 
Private gifts received in the first half of this fiscal year have totaled nearly <MONEY>$ 109 million</MONEY> . 
<PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> announced that the university has maintained its ranking as the No. 2 public school , as ranked by <ORGANIZATION>U.S. News & World Report</ORGANIZATION> . 
The university is also the leading four-year public research institution for its six-year graduation rate , and has the highest graduation rate of black students , according to <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> . 
Despite the university 's accomplishments , <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> noted several areas in need of improvement . 
Student safety remains a top concern for the university , especially in light of recent sexual assault cases , <PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> said while the number of racially-motivated incidents has decreased this year , according to the Bias Incident Reporting system , the number of incidents against lesbian , gay , transgender , bisexual and queer students and students of Asian-Pacific backgrounds have increased . 
<PERSON>Casteen</PERSON> also discussed university athletics , faculty and student accomplishments , the importance of the 10-year plan in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION>Capital Campaign</ORGANIZATION> and efforts to replace Provost Gene Block and <PERSON>Ed Ayers</PERSON> , dean of the <ORGANIZATION>College of Arts & Sciences</ORGANIZATION> . 
Although a question-and-answer session was not held following the address , a group of students gathered on the steps of <ORGANIZATION>Old Cabell Hall</ORGANIZATION> afterward , asking the university to take action in implementing a living wage , a topic not discussed at the address . 
" We agree that amazing things are going on here , but we think that the fundamental inability of the university 's low wage workers to adequately support themselves and their families on the wages they make here is grossly overlooked , " said <PERSON>Hannah Pocock</PERSON> , a first-year student and Living Wage Campaign member .
