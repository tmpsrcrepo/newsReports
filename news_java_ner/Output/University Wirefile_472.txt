The woman reported her assailant grabbed her from behind and " carried [ her ] to a grassy area behind a maintenance shed , where he sexually assaulted her , " according to an <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> report . 
DNA evidence from the <DATE>2005</DATE> case has been linked to the <DATE>2009</DATE> disappearance and death of <PERSON>Morgan Harrington</PERSON> , a <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Tech student who went missing after attending a Metallica concert at <ORGANIZATION>John Paul Jones Arena</ORGANIZATION> . 
Harrington 's body was found in <DATE>January 2010</DATE> .

Matthew is currently awaiting a <DATE>Dec. 4</DATE> court date in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> on charges of abduction with intent to defile in the <LOCATION>Graham</LOCATION> investigation . 
The case was recently updated to a death investigation after a search crew found human remains on an abandoned property off Old <LOCATION>Lynchburg Road</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Walnut Creek Park</LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION>Albemarle County</LOCATION> . 
No charges have been filed in the <LOCATION>Harrington</LOCATION> investigation . 
Morrogh said a bench warrant will be issued for <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and he expects <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> to appear in a <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> court shortly afterward . 
Fairfax officials will work with <PERSON>Albemarle</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> police officials to coordinate <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> 's transportation . 
Fairfax Police Chief <PERSON>Carl Pardiny</PERSON> said he could not disclose what evidence led to the charges against <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> . 
" I realize that everybody wants answers to questions , ... but we simply can not comment on the investigation and the evidence in this case , " <PERSON>Pardiny</PERSON> said . 
" The facts and details in this case will be revealed as the case proceeds through the judicial system . " 
Police are not identifying the woman involved in the <DATE>2005</DATE> case , but <PERSON>Morrogh</PERSON> said she has been made aware of the charges brought against <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> . 
" The victim is grateful to the lead detective who stayed in touch with her regularly over the course of nine years and promised her he 'd never gave up , and he never did , " <PERSON>Morrogh</PERSON> said . 
" I think it 's fair to say that she 's grateful that the case will go forward to whatever resolution it comes to . " 
Morrogh said law enforcement officials engaged in a thorough evidence-gathering process before the charges were brought against <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> and he said he is confident the case is " ready to go forward . " 
" I 've learned the hard way over the past 30 years that this is just the first step , " <PERSON>Morrogh</PERSON> said . 
" The criminal justice system can be a long , hard row to hoe , but I have confidence ... that we will be able to go forward and bring justice in this case . " 
Morrogh said he did not know whether <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> would retain the same lawyer for these charges as he has for the charges in the <LOCATION>Graham</LOCATION> investigation . 
" Indirectly [ the <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> ] case was of value to this department in conducting its investigation , " <PERSON>Morrogh</PERSON> said , though he too declined to elaborate on the specific evidence linking <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> to the assault . 
Morrogh said the charges will be handled separately from those <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> faces in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Albemarle County</LOCATION> . 
" This case stands alone , " he said .
