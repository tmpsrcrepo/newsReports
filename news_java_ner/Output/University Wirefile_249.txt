On <DATE>Saturday</DATE> a friend and I set out for the primetime performance of The " Vagina Monologues " in Old <PERSON>Cabel Hall</PERSON> . 
The chocolate vagina pops being sold at the door were the first indication that we were n't in for the subtlest of innuendo . 
The skill and passion of the performers exceeded my every expectation . 
The message of the play , however , did not . 
There certainly have been more objectionable things performed on stage , and at least the money goes to a worthy cause . 
In addition , some parts of the play are genuinely poignant . 
These moments are overshadowed , however , by a tirade of crude and disparaging themes and stories . 
For instance , there is the monologue where a child is interviewed about her vagina , and one where the entire audience joins in chanting the word " cunt . " 
One of the more ridiculous monologues is about a woman who gave up her successful law career to become a " sex worker " because the law job did n't involve " wetness " or " moaning . " 
Then consider one monologue from a teenage girl who had been sexually abused as a child . 
Who is the hero of this story ? 
It 's an older woman who plies her with vodka , undresses her , and has sex with her . 
The young girl says the woman " makes me play with myself in front of her . " 
The audience erupted into laughter when the girl assures her concerned mother in a phone call that there are " no boys " around . 
Perhaps I 'm still using an antiquated definition of " empowerment " but it does n't include drunken child molestation . 
Something tells me that if it were a man taking advantage of a young boy or girl , or a man asking a young child about his or her sexual organs , the situation would n't have been so funny . 
But aside from being an all-out assault on common decency , the play also unravels much of the positive work done on the feminist front in the past century . 
For decades feminist fought so that women would n't be judged by their bodies . 
" The Vagina Monologues , " however , declares that women are their bodies . 
One poorly written poem declares at the end " my vagina , my vagina , me . " 
One women says that her clitoris " was the very essence of me , " while another says " I love vaginas , I love women ; I do n't see them as separate things . " 
It 's one thing to make women comfortable with their sexuality . 
It 's quite another to paint them as desperate slaves to it , which is what " The Vagina Monologues " does . 
Luckily , not every feminist subscribes to the dour philosophy embodied by " The Vagina Monologues . " 
One such person is author and professor <PERSON>Christina Hoff Sommers</PERSON> who gave a lecture at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last Thursday</DATE> . 
As <PERSON>Sommers</PERSON> said in her address on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , " Feminist pioneers like <PERSON>Susan B. Anthony</PERSON> and Sojourner Truth fought long and hard so women would be respected -- not for their sexual anatomy -- but for their minds . " 
Sommers also noted that " empowerment is not staring at your vagina in the mirror and weeping or exulting . 
It 's writing a great essay , running a marathon , starting a successful business , or being a great mother . " 
Somehow <PERSON>Sommers</PERSON> ' sensible message was construed as being " pro-violence " by women who are unable to consider possible objections to their philosophy . 
Sommers also pointed out how many Women Studies departments are a " one-party state , " where dissenting opinion is not included . 
Indeed , <PERSON>Sommers</PERSON> ' critics proved her point when <PERSON>Sommers</PERSON> was subjected to ad-hominum attacks and was rudely interrupted multiple times by <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> professors . 
As N.E.W president <PERSON>Karin Agness</PERSON> commented , " many students are unable or unwilling to truly participate in the intellectual debate that should be occurring on college campuses . " 
Undoubtedly this is a genuine problem . 
Without critique from the outside , the feminist philosophy becomes starved of oxygen , plummeting into a delusional reality where " empowerment " is defined in a tragic story where women give up their successful careers to follow lustful desires and girls find true meaning in their lives after being molested . 
A truly empowering story would show a woman fully engaged in a rewarding and productive career , or an abused child finding a mentor who teaches her a new skill that 's not " playing with myself . " 
Feminists , however , seem to have forgotten the meaning of true empowerment ever since they achieved it .
