Last <DATE>Sunday</DATE> , during <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University</ORGANIZATION> 's " Days on Campus " event for prospective students , the anti-sexual assault student group No Red Tape projected phrases like " Rape happens here " and " Columbia protects rapists " on <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> 's Low Library in central campus . 
According to <ORGANIZATION>The Columbia Daily Spectator</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Graduate Hall Director Rainikka Corprew</ORGANIZATION> and public safety officers obstructed the projection of the phrases , telling activists to wait until prospective students left <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> 's campus before projecting onto the library again . 
Aside from the sloppy handling of the event - <PERSON>Corprew</PERSON> said to the activists , some of whom were sexual assault survivors , that they were " becoming the oppressors " - the inconsistency of allowing No Red Tape to project phrases at some times and not others is problematic . 
If the school is going to allow protest in that form ( as it should ) , it should not limit when that protest can take place for the sake of the university 's reputation . 
Unnecessarily regulating protest prevents it from being its most effective : according to activists who spoke to The Spectator , No Red Tape organized this display specifically to coincide with Days on Campus in order to educate incoming first-years on the issue of sexual assault on campuses and because protesting during that time " was the most likely time that administration would feel obligated to react to activists ' demands . " 
What is the point of protesting if students ca n't do it at times when they can garner the most attention and response ? 
Curbing these protests also misrepresents <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> to prospective students . 
If , on a random day , a <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> student may see a demonstration such as the one No Red Tape organized , preventing that demonstration just for the sake of a prospective student actually does that student a disservice by inaccurately portraying how a given day at that school may be . 
Here at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , after tremendous scandal surrounding our administration 's handling of sexual assault , administrators did not remove signs of student protest . 
When students placed post-it notes detailing their concerns on the doors of <ORGANIZATION>Peabody Hall</ORGANIZATION> , and when the <ORGANIZATION>Seven Society</ORGANIZATION> placed a banner over that same building - a building where many admissions tours start and end - administrators did not take those messages down . 
At that time , the presence of those various protests was the true experience of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students . 
To hide that from prospective students would have been to lie . 
There is a difference here between what public and private schools may regulate , but there is no difference between our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> in terms of what is right and wrong when it comes to the voicing of student concerns . 
In this case , <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> students should not see their protests restricted .
