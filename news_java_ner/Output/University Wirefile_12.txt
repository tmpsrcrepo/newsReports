With sexual assault issues having covered the front page during the past few weeks , it seems almost cosmic coincidence that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is preparing to consider a bill that would increase and facilitate the reporting of those crimes , among others . 
This month , the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> will examine in committee <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Resolution 715 , the Accuracy in Campus Crime Reporting Act . 
It is refreshing that the government finally is addressing a major problem in today 's society . 
Should ACCRA pass , students at universities nationwide would have access to statistics that more accurately reflect campus crime . 
Now , universities can hide behind amendments to the Higher Education Act of <DATE>1965</DATE> , which allow the withholding of crime statistics and information concerning campus judicial and disciplinary proceedings as part of a student 's academic record . 
ACCRA closes those loopholes , forcing institutions of higher education to report campus crime statistics in their entirety . 
On first glance , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> is not part of the conspiracy to block out such information . 
Any criminal incident recorded by any branch of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> in any fashion ( including third-person rape incident reports ) gets forwarded to the <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> . 
Although the police pamphlet entitled " How do you keep yourself safe ? " 
does not contain third-person report statistics this year , they will be included next year . 
The major loophole for accurate information at the <ORGANIZATION>Univeristy</ORGANIZATION> does exist , however : A student can pursue a sexual assault case through the <ORGANIZATION>Univerity Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> without ever notifying the police . 
<LOCATION>ACCRA</LOCATION> , if passed , has the potential to rectify that problem , yet reporting numbers and changing behavior are two different questions . 
The United States government 's actions will be futile if society does not change itself at the same time . 
ACCRA will be useless if no one reports the incidents of crime , and people will not come forward if the environment in which the crimes take place is unfriendly towards them . 
The largest problem in rape reporting at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is not that the administration or the police artificially deflates the numbers . 
It is not that it is hard to report such a crime . 
Rather , it is that the victims do not feel comfortable coming forward to report such crimes . 
The bill is all well and good , but its impact here at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> would be minimal compared to a concerted program to foster a more informed , supportive community . 
The administration needs to work together with student organizations to coordinate a program that will increase awareness about the numerous on-Grounds resources for sexual assault victims . 
Such education would be critical not only for decreasing fear and increasing the number of perpetrators put behind bars , but also for making sure students know enough to avoid becoming victims in the first place . 
If <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> passes <LOCATION>ACCRA</LOCATION> , the accuracy of crime reports on Grounds certainly will increase . 
But bringing crime numbers down to the levels we wish for can not be brought about by legislation in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , regardless of how positive the law may be . 
Instead , the administration and the students must work together to create those changes . 
The rhetoric is old , but the message still needs to stand center stage .
