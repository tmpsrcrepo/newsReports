After almost a week of increased security and heightened student awareness , students have mixed reactions following yesterday 's announcement by the <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> that the alleged assault in the first-floor bathroom of <ORGANIZATION>Cauthen House</ORGANIZATION> never occured . 
Although the police department and the <PERSON>Cauthen</PERSON> resident staff refuse to comment on the details of the incident , any concern about police covering up evidence in the case can be dispelled with the victim 's apparent confession . 
" The alleged victim admitted the incident did not occur , " <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Spokeswoman <PERSON>Kirsten Curtis</PERSON> said . 
Police continue to protect the identity of the student who filed the false report . 
" There is a tough line between protection of the victim and raising community awareness , " <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON> said . 
She said police and <ORGANIZATION>University Community Service Officers</ORGANIZATION> , unarmed security officials who patrol academic buildings , worked side by side to ensure security in the <ORGANIZATION>Cauthen House</ORGANIZATION> area since <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> 's alleged assault . 
She said police stationed at least three officers at the dorm around the clock and manned a sign-in desk for students at the building 's entrance . 
She added that police took the complaint seriously and used every possible measure to protect students while investigating the incident . 
But <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Mike Sheffield</PERSON> said " There were some obvious things right away that a trained investigator could see inconsistencies in . " 
These incongruities did not deter their investigation , however . 
<PERSON>Curtis</PERSON> said the alleged victim could not describe the perpetrator , which hampered their search for the presumed attacker . 
Although resident staff have asked <PERSON>Cauthen</PERSON> residents not to discuss the incident , some students have formed their own ideas about the assault . 
" We think the girl had issues with her mentality , but we do not think she had evil intentions . 
We are more worried about her safety than about blaming her , " an anonymous <PERSON>Cauthen</PERSON> resident said . 
Although several <PERSON>Cauthen</PERSON> residents said they have not received an official explanation for what actually occurred , a second anonymous source said , " The impression we 've gotten is that she staged the entire thing . " 
According to sources , the details of the alleged victim 's story involve a series of e-mail messages . 
" The victim apparently sent threatening e-mails to herself and to two other <PERSON>Cauthen</PERSON> residents to make it look like they were being stalked . 
When [ officials ] discovered the e-mails were coming from her , she blamed the ' stalker ' for tampering with the e-mail system , " the second anonymous source said . 
The <PERSON>Cauthen</PERSON> resident said she feels sorry for " the other two girls who got dragged into it . " 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> officials said all suspicions about the invalidity of the assault were confirmed when the alleged victim confessed the incident did not occur . 
Although police discovered the assault never happened , mass student e-mails about the event have stressed the importance of safety awareness . 
" I do n't think people should put their guards down . 
Just as it did n't happen , it very well could have , " one <PERSON>Cauthen</PERSON> resident said . 
Even with this alleged incident and <DATE>last Thursday</DATE> 's sexual assault near the Small Building in the Engineering School , <LOCATION>Sgt. Buddy Durham</LOCATION> , a <ORGANIZATION>University CSO</ORGANIZATION> , has not noticed an increase in the use of the <ORGANIZATION>Student Escort System</ORGANIZATION> , a nightly transportation system intended to protect student safety . 
Students " have the ' it 's not going to happen to me ' attitude , " <PERSON>Durham</PERSON> said . 
The prosecution of the alleged <PERSON>Cauthen</PERSON> assault victim for filing a false report will go before the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth Attorney</ORGANIZATION> for consideration , <PERSON>Curtis</PERSON> said . 
But she said the issue has not yet been discussed . 
Honor Committee member-elect <PERSON>Rene Theriault</PERSON> said because the case involves lying , somebody could file honor charges against the student . 
" It could be considered an honor offense , " <PERSON>Theriault</PERSON> said . 
The alleged victim could not be reached for comment .
