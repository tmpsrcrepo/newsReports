Will Brumas | The Cavalier Daily <PERSON>Keith Martin</PERSON> , above , is the current rector of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , taking the position when <PERSON>Helen Dragas</PERSON> ' term ended . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> convened in a special meeting <DATE>Friday</DATE> to discuss the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's ongoing efforts to combat sexual assault . 
Rector <PERSON>George Martin</PERSON> set the meeting 's tone early , acknowledging the tumultuous semester the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community has experienced . 
" Few student bodies in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> or anywhere in the world have had to endure a semester like the one our students have endured this <DATE>fall</DATE> , " he said , noting the deaths of four <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students along with the recent allegations of sexual assault which came to light in a Rolling Stone article published last month . 
He said the Rolling Stone allegations , whose accuracy has been hotly refuted in the weeks since the article 's publication , were damaging to many individuals , to the community 's reputation , and to the greater cause of reducing sexual violence on Grounds . 
" We are tempted to respond to these injustices with anger , " he said . 
" But a great <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> does not respond in anger . 
Its very mission is to teach the power of truth and reason over prejudice and passion . 
And we need to practice what we preach . " 
Because students involved in the article have not waived their privacy rights , he said , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has been prevented from " calling attention to the false portrayal of its actions in the Rolling Stone article , " and from answering questions about what information <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> personnel were aware of before the article 's publication . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> quickly went into a closed executive session , which <ORGANIZATION>Martin</ORGANIZATION> said would offer members the opportunity to hear from legal counsel about what specific to the allegations could be disclosed publicly - though he noted members and administrators would refrain from discussing the findings of any investigations until they are completed . 
After a 90-minute executive session , the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> heard from <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> about several long-term and short-term policies and proposals the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> intends to put forward to help foster a safer environment for students on Grounds . 
Among a host of initiatives , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will be installing upgraded lighting systems on Grounds , installing surveillance cameras across Grounds , collaborating with local merchants who wish to have cameras installed on their properties and developing a new " ambassador program , " which will bring 10-12 unarmed personnel to patrol the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> area and provide students a " visible sign of security . " 
Many of these efforts , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> emphasized , were an ongoing part of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's plan to increase safety on and around Grounds , even before the Rolling Stone article was published . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> also approved the hiring of four new counselors - two at the Women 's Center , as part of an effort to offer long-term support groups for sexual assault survivors , and two who will work with <ORGANIZATION>Counseling and Psychological Services</ORGANIZATION> . 
These counselors come in addition to two recently hired Title IX investigators . 
In the long term , she said the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community must work to change its culture , creating an environment with more consistent reporting of sexual assaults and better bystander intervention . 
" I believe U.Va . 
can be a leader in this effort , " she said . 
" We are in the spotlight , so we have the opportunity to lead . " 
The Ad <ORGANIZATION>Hoc Group on University Climate and Culture</ORGANIZATION> , chaired by <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> , will meet again <DATE>Monday</DATE> to further develop and advance strategies for improving culture as well as <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> prevention and response efforts . 
" I want to emphasize that we want our university to be a safe place for all of our students , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" Not because we want to be compliant with the law , but because that 's the way [ students ] will learn best . " 
Chief Operating Officer <PERSON>Pat Hogan</PERSON> offered a brief summary of the financial impact of the proposals <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> put forward . 
Improved lighting - a project already underway , he said , but now with an accelerated timeline - will cost <MONEY>$ 2 million</MONEY> , with an additional <MONEY>$ 430,000</MONEY> for improving crosswalk safety . 
Upgrading the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's camera system will top <MONEY>$ 1 million</MONEY> , while the ambassador program is expected to reach <MONEY>$ 800,000</MONEY> and the four new counselors will cost <MONEY>$ 190,000</MONEY> annually . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> then heard a presentation from <PERSON>Apalla Chopra</PERSON> , a legal representative from <ORGANIZATION>O'Melveny</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> , the firm tasked by <ORGANIZATION>Attorney General Mark Herring</ORGANIZATION> to examine the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's handling of sexual assault cases . 
Chopra offered a detailed overview of the various obligations and requirements set forth by the Clery Act , Title IX and the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Michael Gibson</PERSON> rounded out the open session of the meeting , offering a brief introduction to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's Clery Act report - released this year on <DATE>Sept. 30</DATE> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> is next scheduled to meet <DATE>Feb. 19</DATE> and 20 .
