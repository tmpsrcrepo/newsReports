The <ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> passed a revised version of the <ORGANIZATION>Standards of Conduct</ORGANIZATION> , the 12 guidelines governing the behavior of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students , at their meeting <TIME>last night</TIME> . 
In <DATE>February</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> members began discussions and revisions concerning the Standards after a re-examination in the <DATE>spring</DATE> semester found that several actions were not included in the rules . 
The Standards last were revised in <DATE>1988</DATE> . 
Under current Standards a student committing a sexual assault on the Corner would not be violating a Standard because the incident did not take place on Grounds , said <PERSON>Brian Hudack</PERSON> , vice chairman for first years . 
The new Standards include the stipulation " within the city of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Albemarle County</LOCATION> " -- adding new jurisdiction for the Standards . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> also removed the word " intent " from both Standard 4 -- which prohibits disruption in classrooms -- and Standard 11 -- which prevents breaching confidentiality in " Judiciary Committee , the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> or any other <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> agency or special status organizations . " 
UJC Judge <PERSON>Marshall Sheifman</PERSON> said taking the word intent out of those rules allowed students to initiate cases in which premeditation is not present . 
Committee Chairwoman <PERSON>Amanda Morrow</PERSON> endorsed the revision , noting that a section in judiciary trials is dedicated to determining whether a student intended to commit the violation . 
" Only two of the rules mentioned intent . 
Either they all should or none of them should mention intent , " <PERSON>Hudack</PERSON> said . 
The revised Standards passed by a majority vote of 11 to 5 . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> hopes to present the revised <ORGANIZATION>Standards to University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>John T. Casteen III</PERSON> and to <PERSON>William W. Harmon</PERSON> , vice president for student affairs , for feedback by <DATE>December</DATE> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> must approve the revised Standards before they can go into effect . 
Hudack said he hopes the revised Standards will be in place by the <DATE>spring</DATE> semester .
