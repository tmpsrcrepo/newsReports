Nearly two-thirds of undergraduate college students around the nation report they have experienced some sort of sexual harassment during their collegiate careers , according to a study titled " Drawing the Line : Sexual Harassment on Campus , " conducted by the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of University Women</ORGANIZATION> . 
Additionally , nearly one-third of students reported that the harassment was of a physical nature , such as being grabbed or touched in a sexual way , the survey states . 
The <ORGANIZATION>AAUW</ORGANIZATION> held a press conference on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at which the <ORGANIZATION>AAUW</ORGANIZATION> leadership addressed the survey 's findings . 
The transcripts of the press conference were made available on the <ORGANIZATION>AAUW</ORGANIZATION> 's Web site . 
" Sexual harassment is common among today 's undergraduate students -- so common that it seems normal , as one student put it , " said <PERSON>Elena Silva</PERSON> , director of research for the <ORGANIZATION>AAUW Educational Foundation</ORGANIZATION> , at the press conference . 
According to the survey , although both male and female undergraduates report experiencing sexual harassment , female students are more strongly affected by it . 
While <PERCENT>35 percent</PERCENT> of male students who reported being sexually harassed said that the experience made them feel somewhat or very upset , <PERCENT>68 percent</PERCENT> of female students who reported experiencing sexual harassment said they felt very or somewhat upset . " 
[ Sexual harassment ] prevents college students , both male and female , from achieving the social and academic benefits that colleges and universities aim to provide , " said <PERSON>Barbara O'Connor</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>AAUW Educational Foundation</ORGANIZATION> , at the press conference . 
The survey also found that most students who sexually harass other students say they did so because they thought it was a funny thing to do , and that the majority of students who experienced sexual harassment do not go to school employees for help . 
<PERSON>Virginia Frischkorn</PERSON> , leadership chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Council</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , said that the survey did an excellent job of getting a higher response rate than usual from students around the nation who had experienced sexual harassment . 
Frischkorn added that there are still large numbers of students who have experienced sexual harassment and have not come forward . 
" The findings are still vastly under-reported , " she said . 
According to <PERSON>Frischkorn</PERSON> , the findings in the survey apply fairly well to the situation at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> , where a continuing effort should be made to educate people about sexual harassment and sexual assault . 
" We need to bring more awareness as to what is appropriate and what is not , " she said . 
Students at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> who do not feel comfortable talking to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employees about sexual harassment experiences can make use of other resources , such as peer counseling and the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Resource Agency</ORGANIZATION> hotline or the office of equal opportunity programs .
