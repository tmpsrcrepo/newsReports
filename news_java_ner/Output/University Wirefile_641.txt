While " 50 Shades of Grey " opened to soaring box office sales a little over a week ago , evidence suggests the movie may showcase several of the signs of abusive relationships set out by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION> lists 18 signs of abusive relationships on its website - eight of which appear in the relationship between <PERSON>Ana Steele</PERSON> and <PERSON>Christian Grey</PERSON> , the two main characters in " 50 Shades of <LOCATION>Grey</LOCATION> . " 
Four are depicted more than once . 
Over the course of the movie , Christian monitors Ana 's movements without her consent and discourages her from seeing other male friends . 
Grey also contractually requires her to take oral contraceptives , and limits her to a diet of prescribed foods and limited alcohol intake on five separate occasions . 
He verbally threatens her with physical punishment twice . 
In one scene , he beats her six times while she cries in pain and humiliation . 
All of these meet the <ORGANIZATION>DHHS</ORGANIZATION> standards of an abusive relationship . 
While relationships involving bondage , dominance , submission and masochism are supposed to occur with mutual consent , the movie depicts elements of unhealthy levels of domination in all aspects of the relationship - not just in the BDSM scenes . 
" I exercise control in all things , " <PERSON>Grey</PERSON> said in one scene . 
Grey fulfills the <ORGANIZATION>DHHS</ORGANIZATION> abusive relationship criterion of " [ monitoring ] what [ one 's partner is ] doing all the time " on four occasions . 
For example , in one scene , he follows Ana to her mother 's house in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> without her knowledge or consent . 
In another , he illegally tracks her phone to a nightclub , from which he then physically removes her , carrying her unconscious body back to his hotel room without telling anyone . 
These elements of control are psychological as well as physical . 
By juxtaposing statements such as " I am incapable of leaving you alone " with " you can leave at any time , " <PERSON>Grey</PERSON> engages in emotionally manipulative - and questionably abusive - behavior . 
For example , <ORGANIZATION>Grey</ORGANIZATION> garners <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> 's sympathy by opening up about his abusive past - even telling her that she should not love him because he is psychologically damaged . 
This actually entices her to remain in the relationship to help him , causing her to feel she has a duty to please and care for him . " 
[ <PERSON>Grey</PERSON> 's ] confessions of early physical and sexual abuse , along with an almost child-like willingness to open up his painful past to her and her alone , keep [ Ana ] hooked , " <PERSON>Leslie Morgan Steiner</PERSON> wrote in a recent piece for the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post . 
<PERSON>Steele</PERSON> clearly shows the effects of this emotional manipulation . 
On one occasion , she cries on the phone to her mother , while in another scene she jerks her knee away as Christian touches her under the dinner table . 
" Why do you want to punish me ? 
Why do you want to hurt me ? " 
<PERSON>Steele</PERSON> asks <PERSON>Grey</PERSON> towards the end of the movie . 
While <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> does not explicitly revoke her consent until the end of the film , she expresses dissatisfaction with the dominant-submissive relationship dynamic throughout . 
" You will never do that to me again , " <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> said following one of the final scenes in which <ORGANIZATION>Grey</ORGANIZATION> beats her with a belt . 
<PERSON>Steele</PERSON> 's unhappy compliance with <PERSON>Grey</PERSON> 's physical violence foregrounds a relationship in which abuse occurs with the victim 's consent - as confirmed by <ORGANIZATION>DHHS</ORGANIZATION> reference materials .
