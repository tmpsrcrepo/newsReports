The Zs referenced this week 's events , as well as the " serious conversation about sexual misconduct on college campuses , " in their letter .

<PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said protests against the administrations do not occur at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> because of administrators like <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> . 
The Zs also acknowledged the difficulty of the situation administrators face when pursuing , or sometimes not pursuing , cases of sexual violence .

" For somebody who gets a lot of criticism and does such hard work , I ca n't think of anybody ... who is so underappreciated and who deserves this more , " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said .
