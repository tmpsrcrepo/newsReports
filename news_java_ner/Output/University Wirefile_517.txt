<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily As students work through a particularly trying semester - riddled with multiple student deaths and graphic allegations of rape which have shaken individuals throughout the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community - some students are working to find ways to support their peers through the turmoil . 
Student efforts such as " Support Our Survivors " and " What Can We Do ? " 
aim to provide peers constructive and supportive environments to stand against rape culture and sexual assault at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Several student groups - One Less , One in Four , <ORGANIZATION>Peer Health Educators</ORGANIZATION> , Feminism is for Everyone , Sustained Dialogue and the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition</ORGANIZATION> - will host a discussion <DATE>Monday</DATE> at <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> called " What Can We Do ? " 
The involved organizations hope to mediate dialogue among students about the Rolling Stone article released <DATE>last week</DATE> detailing several allegations of rape at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , and discuss how the community can best offer support to survivors . 
SVPC 's Major Events Chair <PERSON>Erica Robertson</PERSON> , a fourth-year College student , said " What Can We Do ? " 
will also allow students to discuss the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's proposed changes to the current sexual misconduct policy . " 
[ It is a ] facilitated discussion where people can come together to talk about how we can move forward from this and how policy is being changed , " she said . " 
[ It is a ] safe space for anyone to get involved in the extent that they want to . " 
Event organizers hope to promote less radical , angry responses to the Rolling Stone article . 
Third-year College student <PERSON>Isabelle Merritt</PERSON> , the treasurer of One Less , said coming together in constructive manner is vital to fighting rape culture at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I think a concern we have about some of the negative reactions is that it could scare [ survivors ] away from reporting or using any of the resources that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> can offer , " <PERSON>Merritt</PERSON> said . 
One in Four President <PERSON>Brian Head</PERSON> , a fourth-year <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> student , stressed the importance of not targeting all men as the problem . 
" Men are often approached as being the problem , with the message being , ' Stop raping people , ' " Head said . 
" However , this message is not a realistic one , because the majority of men will never commit rape . 
Instead our message is one about empowerment : we [ all ] need to change our behaviors and attitudes ... together . " 
Third-year College student <PERSON>Alex Pinkleton</PERSON> launched " Support Our Survivors " to share important resources for students as well as shift the focus of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> dialogue from the negative aspects of the article to its ability to propel change in a positive manner . 
" The point of [ <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> ] doing the story ... was to create an environment where survivors could share their stories as well , and to kind of spark the change , " <PERSON>Pinkleton</PERSON> said . 
Counseling and <ORGANIZATION>Psychological Services</ORGANIZATION> , one of the primary counseling resources available to students , allows students to seek professional help when needed . 
CAPS Director <PERSON>Tim Davis</PERSON> alerted students in an email CAPS would have extended hour during the weekend . 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said students must support their peers to foster a familiar and comfortable environment . 
" Do n't stop asking , ' How are you doing ? ' 
, " he said . 
" That 's probably the most helpful thing you can do . " 
<PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> said listening is very important when communicating with a survivor . 
" Tell them that you believe them , and ask them what you can in that moment do to help them , " she said . 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said students should not become engulfed in reactions and events on Grounds , but should make some attempt to remove themselves from stress caused by recent incidents . 
" Do n't make a hobby of studying what 's going on on Grounds , " he said . 
" Step away from it , talk with your friends about something else , put on some of your favorite music that takes you away from it . "
