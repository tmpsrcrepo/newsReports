<ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity became the first to sign a new Fraternal Organization Agreement <DATE>Jan. 8</DATE> , after the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> police department concluded there was no substantive evidence to corroborate the allegations of a gang rape at the fraternity <DATE>two years ago</DATE> . 
Though the police department has yet to close its investigation , it seems as though this latest development is one of multiple indications that the story surrounding the Rolling Stone report is coming to a conclusion of sorts . 
Greek social activities are no longer banned , on the condition that Greek organizations abide by new safety regulations . 
For a police department even to investigate a rape case without a complainant is uncommon , but the high profile nature of this case encouraged the investigation to proceed anyway . 
Multiple media outlets had already suggested the allegations against <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> were false , so their reinstatement does not come as a surprise . 
But despite many conclusions that <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's story was completely fabricated , many in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community are open to the possibility that some elements of her story are genuine , even if she was mistaken about the fraternity house she was taken to the night it occurred . 
Though this seems to be somewhat of a conclusion in this saga , the unconcluded story of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's trauma , as well as the sexual assault reports of 28 other <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students which never resulted in complaints last year , are reason to worry there is still a threat somewhere in this community . 
The uncertainty is all the more reason to continue improving the infrastructure of our community , to increase safety and support survivors . 
We may or may not get more answers in the coming weeks . 
What we can be certain of is this : there is no justice in a case which accuses a party that did not commit the crime in question . 
<ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> was undeservingly condemned and threatened by a community which did not wait until the facts of the case were investigated to issue judgment . 
But due process must work for both parties - accused and complainant . 
The community is only made safer if the correct offender is apprehended . 
But there have been cases where the justice system has failed rape victims in unacceptable ways . 
The fundamental importance of due process and the growing support for sexual assault survivors are not mutually exclusive , as many suggest . 
Improvement on both fronts is possible . 
Cooperation with an investigation is an important part of due process , and <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> 's cooperation provides an example of how all parties in a case can facilitate the search for the truth , and for justice . 
Phi <ORGANIZATION>Psi</ORGANIZATION> 's name has now been cleared in the national spotlight , but only time will tell whether the reputation of the entire Greek system will change . 
Going forward , we hope that all fraternity men , as vital members of this community , will participate in the movement against sexual violence . 
President of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Stephen Scipione</PERSON> acknowledged in a press release that this incident has " opened our eyes to the problem women like <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> face . " 
This story is far from over ; this event marks only the close of a single chapter .
