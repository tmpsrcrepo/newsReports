While many <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> students thoroughly enjoyed the Rolling Stones concert a few weeks ago , some were caught in an unfortunate bind -- <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> classes . 
This dilemma is more complicated than it seems , and <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> did a poor job of alleviating a major headache . 
The lack of coordination and transportation provisions left some students up a creek without a paddle . 
Some professors and TAs elected to cancel <DATE>Thursday</DATE> evening lectures and discussion sections , saving themselves and their students the logistical nightmare of getting to and from class . 
However , others chose to maintain their normal schedules , leaving students with few options . 
While most discussion sections and even some classes have an allowance of one unexcused absence , some TAs and professors sent out e-mails specifically stating that an absence that <DATE>Thursday</DATE> would not be sanctioned and that switching sections was n't permissible . 
So , with students forced to go to class or face academic penalization , there was little room for discussion , pardon the pun . 
For students who typically walk to class , this was n't a big deal , but for others who live in places like Copeley , U-Heights or other off-Grounds locations , there was no easy solution . 
All of the bus routes , except the <ORGANIZATION>Green</ORGANIZATION> route , shut down in the afternoon . 
According to <PERSON>Rebecca White</PERSON> , director of the <ORGANIZATION>University Department of Parking and Transportation</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>UTS</ORGANIZATION> buses stopped running at <TIME>3:30</TIME> for Blue and Orange routes , 4:30 for the Stadium route and 5:30 for the <ORGANIZATION>Central Grounds</ORGANIZATION> route . 
Another option -- driving to Grounds and parking ( assuming students have cars ) -- was also not feasible . 
Parking at the Emmett/Ivy garage , the <ORGANIZATION>Central Grounds</ORGANIZATION> garage or the <ORGANIZATION>Health System South</ORGANIZATION> garage came at a hefty price for a 50-minute class -- <MONEY>$ 10</MONEY> . 
The parking attendant on duty did give refunds to some students who parked there for class , but actually acquiring a parking space was not easy . 
Information released to the public prior to the concert stated that these parking spaces would be sold starting at <TIME>5:30</TIME> , but the <ORGANIZATION>Central Grounds</ORGANIZATION> garage was almost filled to capacity with occupants paying the <MONEY>$ 10</MONEY> event rate a little after <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> and was completely closed by <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> Parking at <ORGANIZATION>University Hall</ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION>Fontaine Research Park</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>North Grounds</ORGANIZATION> lot was free , but nonetheless crowded with concertgoers and a long walk to class . 
In a phone interview , White mentioned that the Culbreth Theatre lot was available for students to park in , but getting there with the high volume of traffic was hopeless for a six , seven , or eight o'clock class . 
Granted , students who chose to go to the concert did have to walk a long distance if they lived far away , but this was a choice ; students who had classes were n't able to opt out of a long walk after nightfall back to their apartments or houses . 
With police forces concentrated in highly trafficked areas , safety became an issue , especially in light of recent incidents of rape and sexual assault , for those with a journey back to areas not immediately surrounding the stadium or near any major roads . 
Students could have easily avoided this predicament if <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> cancelled classes after 3 or <TIME>4 p.m.</TIME> White acknowledged that it was " hard to transition from an academic day " and " really difficult to deliver in those conditions , " so why make it even more complicated ? 
I 'm not advocating for a reason to skip class , but due to the circumstances , it would have been legitimate . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , as well as professors , should keep this in mind when events such as these arise . 
White compared the situation with a <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> football game , which does occur once in a blue moon . 
Even though it would only affect a small minority of the student body , it would alleviate a problem that should n't go unnoticed . 
Vice President and Provost Gene Block stated in an interview , " I have not personally received complaints that this was a serious problem . 
I will try to understand how widespread it was and look into strategies to remedy this for the future . " 
Other than canceling classes , one possible strategy would be to coordinate with professors and arrange alternate class times for that particular week . 
Executive Staff Assistant to the Vice President and Provost and Office Manager <PERSON>Patricia Hartsook</PERSON> indicated that there was no communication to professors regarding the Rolling Stones concert . 
This does shed light onto a larger issue of placing academics over non-academic endeavors , such as hosting rock and roll bands for entertainment purposes , which is a much more encompassing debate for another column . 
While some would argue that officially canceling classes would essentially be a self-fulfilling prophecy of this criticism , compelling students to attend class when it is logistically impractical sends the exact same message of where priorities lie .
