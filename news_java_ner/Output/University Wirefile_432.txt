<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily The <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> met <DATE>Sunday</DATE> to discuss the coming semester and review outreach and recruitment initiatives . 
Fourth year <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> student and Honor Chair <PERSON>Nick Hine</PERSON> spoke about upcoming changes in the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> interview process , saying the group hopes to include non-members in the interview process . 
" It 's going to help us recruit a more diverse group of support officers , " <PERSON>Hine</PERSON> said . 
" We are suffering from a diversity issue , not just racial diversity but diversity of opinion and experience . " 
<PERSON>Hine</PERSON> emphasized that Honor belongs to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , not any subset group . 
<PERSON>Martese Johnson</PERSON> , third year College student and Vice Chair for <ORGANIZATION>Community Relations</ORGANIZATION> , discussed a potential " Honor is Everywhere " campaign , which would seek to highlight untraditional , honorable acts occurring in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
The committee is also looking to update their bylaws and faculty advising booklets , which have n't seen changes for years . 
Both Honor and <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> have reached out to first year students in particular as the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> begins a new year . 
The two groups are hoping to generate understanding among new students about what the committees do and to generate interest for new membership . 
<PERSON>Caroline Eckert</PERSON> , a fourth year Nursing student and <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> Vice Chair for first years , said joint dorm talks by Honor and <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> members were held in all first year areas over the past week , in which the bodies discussed the different ways they each functioned and in what ways they were available to students . 
UJC Chair <PERSON>Timothy Kimble</PERSON> , a fourth year College student , had the opportunity to speak to first years before Dean Groves ' address regarding sexual assault . 
" Although [ sexual assault is ] not something we deal with explicitly , it is in the standards of conduct and <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> has been mentioned in some of these discussions , " <PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> said . 
" I really want to play a more active role . " 
Honor and <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> also participated in " <PERSON>Newcomb Crawl</PERSON> , " hosting an ice cream social for students interested in participating with either committee . 
Honor committee members have hosted first years at Lawn talks over the past few days , giving every first year hall the opportunity to ask questions about Honor and discuss what they hope to see with the system . 
Committee members said they were pleased with the effort so far . 
Both Honor and <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> have trials already set for this semester - <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> has 14 cases currently pending , and Honor has 11 . 
Honor has trials planned for <DATE>Sept. 14</DATE> , <DATE>Sept. 28</DATE> , <DATE>Oct. 5</DATE> and one tentatively scheduled for <DATE>Sept. 21</DATE> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> will launch mandatory student training for first years at the end of <DATE>September</DATE> . 
The training will educate first years about Honor at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , and if students do not complete the process they will lose access to their <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> email addresses .
