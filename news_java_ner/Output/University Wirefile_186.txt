POP QUIZ : When does life begin ? 
A . 
At conception B . 
At the fusing of the spinal cord ( about 10 days after conception ) C . 
At birth D. 2 years after birth . 
Without a doubt , it 's one of the most loaded questions in American politics . 
Any answer eventually leads to debate over religious beliefs , abortions , past laws , gender , medicine and the sanctity of life . 
As of <DATE>today</DATE> , 30 years have gone by since <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> handed down their decision in <LOCATION>Roe v. Wade</LOCATION> . 
Yet still the debate wages on and on . 
Now , however , with two branches of government controlled by conservatives , the first chance to make a big impact on undoing the wrongs of <PERSON>Roe v. Wade</PERSON> has appeared . 
If Republicans are going to make any headway , they must begin with the middle ground of banning partial-birth abortions . 
Abortion is usually seen as a black and white issue . 
Either you believe in it or you do n't . 
You are pro-life or you are pro-choice . 
Both sides have their lobbies and political supporters . 
Both sides have won victories and faced losses in the past 30 years . 
Both sides hold annual marches and protests , vigils and rallies . 
It may appear that legislatures face the same polarization of decisions . 
Conservative congressmen can neither outright ban abortion nor can they simply allow the " Holocaust of the unborn " to continue . 
They do have a choice , though . 
Legislatures in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> flexed their political power when they required underage girls to undergo a hearing before being allowed to have an abortion . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Bush White House</ORGANIZATION> showed its muscle when it moved to allow fetuses to be classified as an " unborn child " in order for low-income women to receive prenatal care . 
More importantly than these small steps , legislatures have the middle ground of partial-birth abortion , a procedure in which the baby is partially delivered and then its skull punctured . 
Partial-birth abortion is seen as a possible ground for compromise because it lacks all medial benefits . 
<ORGANIZATION>The American Medical Association</ORGANIZATION> has backed this up . 
In the case of a late-term pregnancy where the mother 's life is at stake , it is much safer to fully deliver the baby by cesarean section than to perform the late-term abortion . 
So , those who advocate abortion only in cases of rape , incest or danger to the mother should be less likely to support partial-birth abortion . 
Lawmakers ' ability to sway some of the members of the rigid pro-choice collection will be setting the groundwork for even further legislation , which in such an important battle is a good thing . 
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> tested the middle ground both in <DATE>1996</DATE> and <DATE>1997</DATE> by passing a ban on all partial-birth abortions . 
Both times , however , it was vetoed by President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> . 
Another law was passed last year in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> , but the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> ignored the law and never took a vote . 
Now -- with neither a liberal president nor a branch divided -- is the time to act . 
More importantly than just laying the foundations for the ban on all abortions , the new law will save thousands of lives every year . 
Although the number of partial-birth abortions is miniscule compared to the number of regular abortions performed a year , lives is still being lost . 
Roughly only <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of abortions performed every year are done after the first 21 weeks ( www.prolifeaction.org ) . 
That means still that thousands of pregnancies are terminated with the use of partial-birth abortion . 
Thousands . 
That may not seem like a lot on the large scale of world population or other devastation . 
But think of it this way : Eliminate the entire third year class at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
That 's roughly 3,000 people . 
Imagine they never existed , their lives never impacted yours and the world would never benefit from their contributions . 
Too many children are lost each year . 
Now imagine the third-year class is back . 
Their lives intact , their place in history firm . 
That is what will happen to all the children lost to partial-birth abortion if the ban is passed . 
In the end , the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> most likely wo n't be able to overturn <PERSON>Roe v. Wade</PERSON> in its next two years of power . 
It probably wo n't even be able to sway the hearts of the most staunch die-hard pro-choice advocate . 
It is not a measure to condone abortion , nor to say that regular early abortions are acceptable . 
Rather , it is simply a first step . 
But by taking the first small steps , such as passing the ban on partial birth abortions , countless lives will be saved and the country will be set back on the right track towards the eventual end of abortion . 
Thankfully , the outlook is good . 
" We will pass a partial birth abortion ban , " said Sen. <PERSON>Sam Brownback</PERSON> , ( R-Kansas ) . 
" That 's going to hearten people . 
It 's been a long fight . 
We 're finally turning some of the battle . " 
One law , lots of saved lives -- that 's a good turning point .
