The product of a month-and-a-half long ban on Greek social activities is a host of new safety regulations for every Greek organization . 
Of particular focus are the requirements for fraternities under the purview of the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> , which have borne the brunt of the criticism in the aftermath of Rolling Stone 's story about the gang rape of a first-year student . 
Though the facts of Rolling Stone 's report were later called into question , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> continued the suspension of fraternity social activities , reiterating the importance of staying focused on addressing sexual violence in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
The focus on fraternity safety is not only derived from <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> 's report . 
Research has shown fraternity men are more likely to commit sexual assault than non-fraternity men . 
The new safety regulations - which include guest lists , mandatory sober brothers , and restrictions on the types of alcohol served - have the potential to make fraternity parties safer , if enforced . 
And the regulations developed by all Greek organizations , not just in the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> , are designed to improve overall safety . 
It will be difficult to immediately discern what impact these regulations have , particularly on the issue of sexual assault . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's climate survey is not yet complete , so the actual rate of sexual assault in this community is unknown . 
Implementing these regulations in the <DATE>spring</DATE> semester might also be easier than in the <DATE>fall</DATE> , when first-year students have not yet made any upper-class connections and may not be able to get on a guest list for a fraternity party . 
Time will tell what , if any impact the <ORGANIZATION>FOA</ORGANIZATION> addendum will have . 
Whether the regulations will be enforced remains to be seen . 
IFC President <PERSON>Tommy Reid</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>IFC Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> will investigate and adjudicate any reported violations of the new regulations , but " fraternities are accountable to themselves . " 
We believe the rules were developed with good intentions , and a full recognition of the role the Greek community plays in helping to combat sexual assault . 
But when rules are only enforced internally , fraternities ' adherence to them can be fairly questioned . 
Without an effective system of enforcement , these regulations will only be a fa Ã §ade to improve the image of the Greek system and <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> as a whole , without improving the safety of the community . 
Even if these stipulations are obeyed and enforced , they can not safeguard against every potential sexual assault at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>FOA</ORGANIZATION> addendum only applies to certain types of fraternity functions , leaving much unregulated ground . 
And to regulate every single aspect of fraternity life would be an overreach of power , as fraternities are both social hubs and private households . 
This is not to say the safety measures are inadequate ; they may very well increase the safety at fraternity parties . 
But requiring changes in behavior does not necessarily produce changes in attitudes , and if some aspects of fraternity culture contribute to the prevalence of sexual violence , as some evidence suggests , then larger cultural changes are necessary beyond reforming how parties are thrown . 
It is also important to remember that not all sexual assaults are committed by fraternity members . 
Apartment parties and bars can be unsafe spaces as well , but it is likely impossible to regulate parties which are not accountable to any particular organization . 
So in addition to any reasonable regulations it is possible for the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to implement , constant education programs are necessary to change attitudes as well as behavior . 
Ideally , education about sexual autonomy and effective consent should begin before college , in high school sex education programs , to lay a foundation for good behavior when students are beginning to explore their sexualities . 
An effective disciplinary system within the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and the police department is also necessary to encourage survivors to come forward and report their assaults . 
Prosecuting and punishing rapists will contribute to a necessary change in culture - sending a message that rape is a crime that will not be tolerated in the community . 
We have discussed these cultural reforms before , but it does n't hurt to reiterate them as we think about how to move forward . 
Just as this drive toward change began before Rolling Stone 's story , it must continue after the dust of the media storm settles . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community has made progress , but there is still much work to be done .
