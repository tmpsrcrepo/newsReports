A 22-year-old incident of alleged sexual assault has resurfaced after <PERSON>William Beebe</PERSON> was arrested <DATE>Jan. 4 , 2006</DATE> on a charge of the <DATE>1984</DATE> rape of <PERSON>Liz Seccuro</PERSON> , which occurred during a rush event at the Univeristy of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> Fraternity house . 
A judge in the <LOCATION>Charlottesville Juvenile</LOCATION> and Domestic Relations Court set <PERSON>Beebe</PERSON> 's bond at <MONEY>$ 30,000</MONEY> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> , according to <ORGANIZATION>The Daily Progress</ORGANIZATION> . 
Beebe recently contacted <PERSON>Seccuro</PERSON> as part of an Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step program as an effort to make amends , . 
Seccuro shared her story in the <DATE>Nov. 10 , 1984</DATE> issue of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION>University Journal</ORGANIZATION> . 
In the story , she said she lost control of her limbs after drinking an alcoholic beverage and then was alledgedly raped by <PERSON>William Beebe</PERSON> . 
Wood said there are records in the Dean 's office that indicate <PERSON>Seccuro</PERSON> met with several deans but decided not to press charges at the time . 
" This unfortunate response is typical of the time " back then , <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Education</ORGANIZATION> Coordinator <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
At that time nurses were not allowed to deal with victims of sexual assault , which meant that response was delayed because victims had to wait for an available doctor or resident , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
Doctors who performed the post-rape examination would face a subpoena if the issue went to court . 
" My suspicion is that many doctors refused to perform these examinations because of the potential of having to appear in court , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
According to <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> , many of the problems Seccuro faced were because of ignorance about the nature of sexual assault to the lives of victims . 
Research about sexual assault was in its infancy in <DATE>1984</DATE> , she added . 
At the time most people believed rapists were primarily anonymous strangers , but now it is known that the majority of sexual assaults occur between acquaintances , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
Prevalent myths also hindered rape victims ' recovery . 
There used to be a notion that if sex occurred between people who were drinking or people who knew one another that such instances did not constitute rape , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
Had Seccuro been a student today , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said , she would not have received the same kind of treatment . 
Now police and nurses receive specialized sexual assault training , and many well-trained staff members and students have organized to aid in emotional recovery and to spread awareness about sexual assault , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has renewed its support of Seccuro in her recovery efforts , <ORGANIZATION>Wood</ORGANIZATION> said . 
University President <PERSON>John T. Casteen</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>III</ORGANIZATION> and several administrators as well as <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> have expressed sympathy and have offered to meet with Seccuro to demonstrate the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's sensitivity to the gravity of sexual assault and the its responsibility in aiding victims within the community , <ORGANIZATION>Wood</ORGANIZATION> said . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> also is complying in every way with the <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Department</ORGANIZATION> 's investigation by releasing the records from the <DATE>1984</DATE> incident , she said .
