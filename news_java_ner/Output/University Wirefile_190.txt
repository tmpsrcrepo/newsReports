President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is now trying to put a U-turn on the sexual revolution by planning to increase spending on abstinence-only programs by <MONEY>$ 60 million</MONEY> this year . 
This increased spending should not be spent on restrictive abstinence-only programs , because they are ineffective and do not match popular conceptions about sexuality . 
Instead , a comprehensive sexual education that accurately and scientifically explains the risks of sexual activity should be encouraged . 
More than one-third of high school students who had sex before graduation regret their decision to become sexually active . 
Twenty-five percent of sexually active teens will contract a STD , and a quarter of all HIV cases occur in people under the age of 21 ( " Risky Business , " <DATE>May 27 , 2002</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>U.S. News & World Report</ORGANIZATION> ) . 
Sex is clearly a dangerous activity , both physically and psychologically , especially for teenagers . 
Statistics like these should encourage abstinence . 
However , making abstinence seem like the only choice for teenagers creates more problems than it solves . 
A study by <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Universities</ORGANIZATION> analyzed the effects of abstinence-only pledges that are similar to the type of education <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is encouraging . 
Indeed , abstinence-only training did delay sexual activity by 18 months . 
However , when a pupil of the abstinence-only program did decide to engage in sexual activity , he or she was less likely to use contraception . 
Granted , having sex too early can leave an emotional scar on a developing teen-ager , but the scar created by a teen pregnancy or STD will cut much deeper . 
Abstinence is the only sure-fire way to prevent disease and pregnancy , but alternatives must be presented so teenagers know what to do if their sexuality overpowers them . 
The dangers of sex must be emphasized , as well as the failure rates of various contraceptives . 
Nevertheless , two-thirds of high school graduates have had sex , and eighty percent of all Americans have premarital sex . 
To send teenagers out into a sexual world without the knowledge of how to protect themselves will eventually lead to more unwanted pregnancies and more STDs . 
According to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. News & World Report</ORGANIZATION> article , abstinence-only programs encourage teenagers to find less healthy ways to release their sexual urges . 
Many teenagers resort to oral and anal sex as a way to retain their " technical virginity , " unaware of the consequences . 
Any sexual education program must include the dangers of these sexual activities , but abstinence-only programs are much more likely to drive kids to other forms of unprotected sexual behavior in order to remain abstinent . 
Also , abstinence-only programs hurt victims of sexual abuse , because they feel they can never truly be abstinent . 
This year , <ORGANIZATION>The Coalition for Adolescent Sexual Health</ORGANIZATION> -- a conservative , faith-based organization -- released a poll that claimed Americans oppose comprehensive sexual education by a 2.4 to 1 ratio . 
Meanwhile , Planned Parenthood contests that over <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of Americans support abstinence-first , comprehensive sexual education . 
Which poll is correct ? 
Neither . 
Both polls are incredibly biased and are just attempts to push their respective agendas . 
However , because most Americans have pre-marital sex , it is clear that sex before marriage does not go against the beliefs and values of many Americans . 
If most Americans are having sex before marriage , they send the message that premarital sex is okay . 
The media certainly reinforces this belief . 
The trend for Americans is to have sex before marriage , and abstinence-only programs can not stop such a force . 
If abstinence-only programs can not prevent people from having sex -- the baby-boom generation who had little sexual education started the sexual revolution -- then there is no point , and in fact , teaching children that abstinence is the only way is dangerous . 
What sexual education programs can attempt to discourage are random hook-ups and one-night stands . 
America might not be ready to return to the maxim of " no sex before marriage , " but the adults of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> have the responsibility to teach the youth that sex with many , less well-known partners is especially dangerous . 
Pre-marital sex with a significant other of two years is a lot different than drunken sex back in the dorm room after a frat party . 
The former can still be an expression of love and intimacy , while the latter is just lust and peril . 
In the sexual world we live in , a complete sexual education is essential . 
Thankfully , we live in a world where sex is a subject that can be discussed . 
However , abstinence-only programs pull back the benefits of increased awareness of one 's sexuality while creating a completely new set of problems .
