<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily Princeton University</ORGANIZATION> reached an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last Wednesday</DATE> to end an ongoing investigation of its sexual assault policy said to be in violation of Title IX , which bans discrimination on the basis of sex in educational institutions . 
The investigation , which began in <DATE>2011</DATE> , was prompted by three sexual misconduct cases that <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION> was found to have dealt with improperly . 
In two of the cases , accused students were not allowed to appeal their decision , and in the third , a student found guilty of sexual misconduct was allowed to remain on campus for a significant period of time after the decision . 
The violation occurred because <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION> was one of the last universities in the country to continue using the " clear and convincing " standard in matters of sexual assault , which stipulates there must be a <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> chance the accused is responsible for the assault . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Office of Civil Rights</ORGANIZATION> found this was in violation of the Title IX preponderance clause , which holds the accused is guilty if he or she is more likely than not responsible for the assault . 
The investigation also found the institution failed to provide equal appeal rights to both the accused and the plaintiff . 
Only the accused was permitted to appeal to the court once a decision was made . 
Under the new agreement , <ORGANIZATION>Princeton</ORGANIZATION> will grant both the accused student and the complainant equal appeal rights in front of the school 's committee on sexual misconduct . 
They must handle new cases within roughly 45 days and re-examine all complaints filed between the start of the 2011-12 academic year and <DATE>Sept. 1</DATE> of this year to determine whether cases were dealt with appropriately . 
" The agreement reaffirms our commitment to address all matters of sexual misconduct in ways that are fair , effective and transparent , and our determination to ensure a campus climate that places high priority on prevention and support , and on ensuring safety and freedom from discrimination for all members of our campus community , " Princeton President <PERSON>Christopher Eisgruber</PERSON> said in a statement . 
According to a statement released by the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Education 's Office of Civil Rights</ORGANIZATION> , the university will develop and promote educational campaigns on safety and " deter retaliation . " 
" I applaud <ORGANIZATION>Princeton University</ORGANIZATION> for its commitment to ensuring a community-wide culture of prevention , support , and safety for its students , staff , and community , " <PERSON>Catherine Lhamon</PERSON> , assistant secretary for civil rights , said in the statement . 
" We look forward to continuing to work cooperatively with <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION> to implement this agreement . " 
Princeton spokesperson <PERSON>Martin Mbugua</PERSON> said in a statement the findings of the investigation do not carry any penalties . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> is currently investigating 85 colleges and universities due to complaints filed by individuals regarding the adjudication of cases of sexual assault . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is also on this list , and has been under investigation for three years . 
Assoc. Dean of Students <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> entered into a five-year review of its sexual misconduct policies beginning in <DATE>spring 2011</DATE> . 
Soon after , a " Dear Colleague " letter released by the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> included further revisions to university policies on a national scale , including the preponderance standard . 
That same year , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> adopted the standard and has since been re-assessing past cases . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> continues to revise its policies on sexual assault to comply with the federal government , recently adopting the provisions of the " Campus Save Act , " which requires universities enact " primary prevention and awareness programs " regarding sexual misconduct and related offenses . 
The Hoos Got Your Back campaign , enacted this semester to promote bystander intervention , is intended to fill this role . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> handles cases in a timeframe of generally 60 days , save for extenuating circumstances or if the complainant decides to retract the accusation . 
Both parties are granted equal appeal rights .
