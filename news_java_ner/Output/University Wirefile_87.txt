The <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> 's student-run sexual assault education organizations are now collaborating their efforts through the newly-formed <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Leadership Council</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> is made up of student leaders from <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Facts and Education</ORGANIZATION> , One in Four and <ORGANIZATION>Peer Health Educators</ORGANIZATION> . 
These groups still will operate individually , but their leaders will meet with the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> to facilitate communication among the groups . 
On <DATE>Friday</DATE> , leaders from these organizations presented their programs for the other groups , faculty and administrators . 
This larger group will meet today to offer feedback about the presentations . 
There will be " discussions within the group about how the presentations can be more effective , " said <PERSON>Martha Rutkowski</PERSON> , SAFE 's representative to the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> . 
Offering constructive criticism about each other 's programming is the first step in the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> members ' long-term collaborative efforts , <PERSON>Rutkowski</PERSON> said . 
" Working together you cover more ground , " she said . 
The three sexual assault groups had become fairly competitive with one another , but the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> may alleviate this tension , she added . 
" Instead of being territorial , we can feel confident in the other groups ' [ presentations ] and that [ each presentation ] could build on " the others , <PERSON>Rutkowski</PERSON> said . 
Having the groups working together is especially important on an issue like sexual assault because of its seriousness and urgency , she said . 
Before the formation of the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> , each group was often uninformed about the other groups ' activities , she added . 
Since the groups are working on the same issue , " it 's like the right hand should know what the left hand is doing , " <PERSON>Rutkowski</PERSON> said . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> 's next project will be to use funds from the three assault education groups to make a card-sized resource flier to distribute around Grounds . 
The flier will include phone numbers for students to find safe rides home as well as helplines for sexual assault victims . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> developed after <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Students Penny Rue</ORGANIZATION> assembled a group of sexual assault education activists , faculty and administrators in <DATE>November</DATE> . 
" I felt an appropriate role as Dean of Students was to create an environment where collaboration is more likely , " <PERSON>Rue</PERSON> said . 
The students at the meeting then decided to form the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> , which held its first meeting in <DATE>December</DATE> . 
Because the <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> consists only of students who are leaders in sexual assault education groups , it should be an effective way of preventing overlapping in the groups ' programs , <PERSON>Rutkowski</PERSON> said .
