This past <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> did indeed mark the passage of the 55th anniversary of the Jewish-Arab battle at the village of <PERSON>Deir Yassin</PERSON> , but it was not , as some propagandists like to claim , a massacre . 
The conflict in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> has never been a pretty one , but to call the Jewish people " terrorists " and the Arabs " victims " is far from the truth . 
After World War II , the British decided that they could not deal with the rising conflict between the Arabs and the Jews , because both parties demanded their own nation . 
A compromise emerged to foster both an Arab and Israeli state . 
Unfortunately , it became evident that forces on both sides were unhappy with the proposed compromise ; the leading Jewish authorities eventually accepted it , while the Arab League Secretary <PERSON>Azzam Pasha</PERSON> on <DATE>Sept. 16 , 1947</DATE> , had this to say about the creation of a Jewish state : " Nations never concede ; they fight . 
You wo n't get anything by peaceful means or compromise . 
You can , perhaps , get something , but only by the force of your arms . " 
Despite the opposition , the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> passed <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> Resolution 181 , splitting the territory into a Jewish state and a planned Palestinian state , with <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> itself under international control . 
The Jews in <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> , now in the heart of the planned Palestinian state , found themselves facing a blockade . 
Arab irregulars prevented shipments of food and medicine to the Jews living there . 
The " terrorist groups " that the propagandists refer to defended the Jews in the city and brought them food and supplies . 
<PERSON>Deir Yassin</PERSON> was located on a strategic hill overlooking the primary road into the city , the highway to <LOCATION>Tel Aviv</LOCATION> . 
It commanded a broad view of the surrounding area , and was located less than a mile from the outskirts of the city . 
There were Arab soldiers living in and attacking from the village . 
It was thus decided to conquer the village . 
The villagers were warned by a truck with a loudspeaker , and many left before the fighting began . 
Due to deceptive tactics of fake surrender and fighters dressed as women , approximately 100 Arabs were killed . 
The number was eventually confirmed by Professor <PERSON>Sharif Kanaana</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Bir Zeit University</ORGANIZATION> ( located in current day Palestine ) in his study , " Reinterpreting Deir Yassin . " 
This number is significantly less than the number touted by many people . 
The battle at <PERSON>Deir Yassin</PERSON> was a very sad event , and civilians did die . 
However the circumstances of the event were greatly exaggerated to try to foster anti-Semitism . 
Neither the British nor the Red Cross witnessed the event , but the Jews called in the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> afterwards to inspect the battleground to dispel rumors of a massacre . 
<PERSON>Hussein Khalidi</PERSON> , the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Arab Higher Committee</ORGANIZATION> saw the event as an opportunity . 
According to the <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> Report on <DATE>April 2 , 1998</DATE> , he said , " We must make the most of this . " 
Khalidi proceeded to write a press release detailing many false atrocities . 
In response to criticism from the villagers themselves that " there was no rape " ( <PERSON>Abu Mahmud</PERSON> , resident of <PERSON>Deir Yassin</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> television series " <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> and the Arabs : the 50-year conflict . " ) 
, <PERSON>Khalidi</PERSON> responded , " We have to say this , so the Arab armies will come to liberate Palestine from the Jews . " 
In the four months following the partition , over 500 Jewish civilians were killed by terror attacks on non-military targets . 
To call this conflict one-sided would be simply wrong . 
In the present day , the fact remains that many Palestinians refuse to accept or acknowledge the existence of the state of <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> . 
To many civilians and leaders , the only acceptable " compromise " is the complete destruction of <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> . 
An Arab language textbook by the name of Our Arabic Language For Fifth Grade # 542 says , " Remember : the final and inevitable result will be the victory of the Muslims over the Jews . " 
( pp.67-69 ) Arab children are taught from the very beginning to hate <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> . 
This is why it is increasingly hard to sympathize with the plight of the Palestinians . 
Many are still waiting for the glorious Arab armies to rise up and destroy the Jews . 
On <DATE>January 30 , 1996</DATE> , <PERSON>Yasser Araft</PERSON> said , " we Palestinians will takeover everything , including all of <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> . " 
In <DATE>2000</DATE> , at the Camp <PERSON>David II</PERSON> peace talks , <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> offered <PERCENT>97 percent</PERCENT> of the land the Arabs lost in <DATE>1967</DATE> when they attacked <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> and an additional <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> of land in <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> proper . 
This land would be used for the creation of a Palestinian state . 
In return <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> asked for peace . 
The Arab leaders said " no " and instead chose to step up the terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians . 
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> has as much a right to exist in the region as the Palestinians . 
Despite what some propagandists will tell you , <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> was founded not on a basis of terrorism , but on most of the same Western values that the <ORGANIZATION>United States</ORGANIZATION> supports . 
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> has fought five wars in self defense against various invading Arab forces . 
While atrocities have been committed on both sides , no one can deny <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> 's moral right to exist and defend itself . 
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> offers a good deal of foreign aid to <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> because , quite frankly , they are in a very tough situation . 
The Palestinians have often showed that they are not willing to compromise , and <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> is daily subjected to terrorist attacks . 
We help <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> because it is the right thing to do . 
America has been subjected to terrorist attacks , and we must do our best to help with the removal of terrorists . 
The conflict in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> is a dirty and dangerous one . 
Neither side has the absolute moral high ground , nor can either side claim to have done nothing wrong , but labeling the Palestinians " victims " of Jewish oppression is a completely unfounded statement .
