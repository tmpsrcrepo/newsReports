Following the arrest of <LOCATION>Orange County</LOCATION> resident <PERSON>Garnett James Lloyd</PERSON> for breaking into the <ORGANIZATION>Delta Zeta</ORGANIZATION> sorority house <DATE>March 14</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police</ORGANIZATION> held a line-up yesterday to identify a possible suspect in related incidents . 
The police investigation of the break-in has expanded to examine possible connections to last fall 's string of break-ins and sexual assaults that occurred in the Rugby Road and Chancellor Street vicinities . 
Police said they were examining connections Lloyd could have to the break-ins and assaults , but that it was too early for any allegations . 
" We 're taking a hard look at it , but we 're not saying he 's a suspect in these cases , " <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Lt. Chip Harding</ORGANIZATION> said . 
Police arrested <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> in the sorority house after being alerted by the <ORGANIZATION>Delta Zeta</ORGANIZATION> housemother that there was an intruder inside . 
Lloyd subsequently was charged on a felony count of breaking and entering with the intent to commit larceny and released on <MONEY>$ 10,000</MONEY> bail . 
Police began to suspect that at least one person was targeting <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> females when Chancellor Street area sororities , including <ORGANIZATION>Delta Zeta</ORGANIZATION> , began reporting disturbances and break-ins in the <DATE>fall</DATE> . 
Concerns grew after one <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student was raped beneath Beta Bridge <DATE>Oct. 15</DATE> and another sexually assaulted <DATE>Nov. 14</DATE> on 17th Street . 
According to <ORGANIZATION>Harding</ORGANIZATION> , the police department has been running line-ups for witnesses involved in break-ins occurring in the area within the past year . 
" We were showing line-ups to witnesses in relation to this break-in and various break-ins in the area , " he said . 
He added police plan to release descriptions of <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> , his vehicle and past disturbances in the area after the department concludes the line-up process with all known witnesses . 
" We do n't want to taint our evidence by releasing information too soon , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
" Still , we might release his description later to see if it would joggle people 's memories , " he said . 
" Also , from a preventative standpoint , it would n't be a bad idea if residents knew what he looked like-he is out on bond . " 
The <DATE>March 14</DATE> disturbance marked the fourth time the <ORGANIZATION>Delta Zeta</ORGANIZATION> house was broken into in the past year . 
During previous break-ins , the perpetrator made 1-900 phone calls from the house and stole residents ' undergarments and personal photographs . 
Three city detectives served a search warrant on Lloyd 's residence last week looking for the sorority sisters ' missing items , <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
" The detectives went in looking for them , but did not turn up the undergarments , " he said . 
Though never convicted of a sex crime , <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON> was convicted on charges of simple assault after groping two saleswomen in <DATE>1996</DATE> . 
<ORGANIZATION>Delta Zeta</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Allison Snodgrass</PERSON> declined to comment on the arrest but said all her housemates " were doing just fine . " 
Breaking and entering with the intent to commit larceny is a Class 6 felony which is punishable by up to 20 years imprisonment and/or up to <MONEY>$ 2,500</MONEY> fine . 
Lloyd could not be reached for comment .
