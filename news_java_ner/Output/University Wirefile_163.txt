After news came out that <ORGANIZATION>Virginia House of Delegates Speaker S. Vance Wilkins Jr.</ORGANIZATION> , R-Amherst , settled a <MONEY>$ 100,000</MONEY> out-of-court sexual misconduct complaint , many House Republicans began calling for his resignation . 
<LOCATION>Amherst</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> resident <PERSON>Jennifer L. Thompson</PERSON> , 26 , accepted the settlement last year after claiming that <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> made repeated unwelcome advances on her while she was working in the complex where the speaker housed his office . 
Thompson signed an agreement at the time of the settlement binding her to confidentiality on the settlement 's details . 
Wilkins admitted to paying the settlement but adamantly denied the allegations of sexual misconduct in a closed caucus meeting of 57 Republican delegates <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> . 
" The speaker has categorically denied allegations of sexual harassment , " said <PERSON>John Hall</PERSON> , an intern in <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> ' office . 
According to <ORGANIZATION>House Appropriations Committee</ORGANIZATION> Chair <PERSON>Vincent F. Callahan Jr.</PERSON> , R-Fairfax , many legislators are unwilling to believe <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> ' denials . 
There have existed " rumors of his previous past indiscretion around the General Assembly for years , " <PERSON>Callahan</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> also flatly denied a second accusation from 45-year-old <LOCATION>Amherst</LOCATION> resident <PERSON>Elizabeth P. Massie</PERSON> , who claimed <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> made improper sexual advances at a <DATE>2001</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Christmas Party</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Amherst County</LOCATION> . 
Politics Professor <PERSON>Larry J. Sabato</PERSON> said other legislators ' reactions to the controversy are mixed . 
" There are many legislators who are very disappointed in the speaker , but others who support him , " <PERSON>Sabato</PERSON> said . 
Hall claimed <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> maintains the support of his friends and staff . 
" Everyone [ in the speaker 's office ] who has worked with the speaker supports him , " <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> said . 
He added that he has received several dozen phone calls voicing support for the speaker from both delegates and constituents . 
All 65 House Republican leaders have been invited to attend a <DATE>June 18</DATE> caucus meeting to discuss the next steps that will be taken . 
According to <PERSON>Sabato</PERSON> , this upcoming week may not only provide an opportunity for <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> to lobby , but also to potentially threaten fellow Republicans to stand behind him . 
" The speaker is a very powerful person , " <PERSON>Sabato</PERSON> said . 
He added that <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> could potentially injure a delegate 's political future with his influence . 
A <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> speaker has never been ousted from office , according to <PERSON>Callahan</PERSON> . 
He said a range of penalties could be implemented next week , ranging from forced removal to a formal act of censure or even no punishment at all . 
" That 's not going to happen , " <PERSON>Callahan</PERSON> said . 
" Some action will be taken . " 
Callahan speculated that the <ORGANIZATION>GOP Caucus</ORGANIZATION> would recommend that <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> resign from his position . 
At this point in time , though , <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> " seems very unwilling to resign , " <PERSON>Sabato</PERSON> said . 
This means that the other representatives , if they wish <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> to resign , will have to convince him that he will otherwise be ousted . 
For <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> to be ousted , a two-thirds vote in a special session would be required . 
This scenario could harbor political consequences for the party 's future , <PERSON>Sabato</PERSON> said . 
" If they oust him , the Republicans will come back quickly because the focus will be on the new speaker , " <PERSON>Sabato</PERSON> said . 
" If they keep him in office , they will suffer for it . "
