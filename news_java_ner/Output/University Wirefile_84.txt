The <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Parents Program</ORGANIZATION> may collaborate with <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> police and the Office of the Dean of Students in jump starting an off-Grounds housing safety evaluation program . 
Parents Program Director <PERSON>Molly Bass</PERSON> said planning still is in preliminary stages , but that the three parties probably will meet before the end of the semester . 
One potential approach to the project would involve compiling a comprehensive list of off-Grounds housing options and their safety features , <PERSON>Bass</PERSON> said . 
The listing would not label housing " good vs. bad or develop a rating system that would cause friction within the community , " she said . 
Instead , the program probably would note which safety features are " present vs. not present , " she added . 
But the <ORGANIZATION>Parents Program</ORGANIZATION> also must decide whether the housing safety project is feasible or practical , she added . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> would help the <ORGANIZATION>Parents Program</ORGANIZATION> in its efforts to promote student safety in off-Grounds housing , <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Michael Coleman</PERSON> said . 
" If they do decide to do this and make something like this , certainly ... we would work with them , " <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said . 
Police probably would contribute by evaluating the safety levels of the off-Grounds housing areas , <PERSON>Bass</PERSON> said . 
Members of the Parents Program " are not safety experts , " she said . 
But police effectively could " evaluate what is out there and what should be out there . " 
Many parents ' concerns about student safety have heightened this semester in light of several recent attacks that occurred on and around Grounds , she added . 
Two <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students were victims in an armed break-in and rape in the <LOCATION>Venable</LOCATION> neighborhood <DATE>Aug. 26</DATE> . 
An attempted sexual assault also occurred in <LOCATION>Azalea Park</LOCATION> <DATE>Aug. 30</DATE> . 
Then a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student was robbed at gunpoint outside <ORGANIZATION>Courtenay House</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Oct. 31</DATE> . 
By developing an off-Grounds housing evaluation program , the Parents Program hopes to alleviate some parents ' concerns , <PERSON>Bass</PERSON> said . 
" The intent ... is that parents and students better understand what is available to them in terms of safety , " she said .
