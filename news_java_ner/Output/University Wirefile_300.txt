Growing up with a father who has spent the past 25 years working for the <ORGANIZATION>Civil Rights Division</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Justice</ORGANIZATION> , I think it would be fair to say that I have developed a strong sense for the law and all that its implications entail in this country . 
Over the years , I have seen many legal cases that have violated my views on fair justice and equality . 
Never , however , has my sense of justice been as violated as it has been during the past few months as I have witnessed the unfolding of the " Duke Lacrosse Scandal " . 
As someone who has followed this case closely , it appears -- barring any unpublicized bombshell evidence -- undeniably evident that the three accused players are innocent of the charges against them . 
Moreover , it appears that they , along with the rest of the Duke men 's lacrosse team , are victims not only of the false accusations , but also of the hype built up by a media industry that is more beholden to what is deemed " politically correct " interpretation of events rather than the actual facts of the case . 
I do not , however , want to delve too deeply into the legal minutiae of this case . 
I am by no means a legal expert and I certainly do not know anything about the complexities of a rape case . 
As a sports writer , however , I do want to focus on the unfair tarnish that this case has put on the image of collegiate lacrosse . 
In recent months , college lacrosse has been castigated as a sport dominated by rich , white elitists who care for nothing except their own amusement and gratification . 
Countless social " experts " have paraded across our television screens painting images of boorish and irresponsible behavior that is supposedly rooted in the elite backgrounds of these athletes . 
Apparently , if one is white , male , athletic and rich , he is destined for life dominated by such reprehensible behavior . 
This charge itself , however , is patently unfair and is reprehensible in and of itself . 
Yes , there are rich white athletes who exhibit this type of loutish behavior . 
But over the years , I have seen athletes and non-athletes , whites and others , as well as both the rich and the poor exhibit this same type of behavior . 
It has become convenient in recent months to put the spotlight for such social ills on college lacrosse . 
It is morally lazy , however , to keep that spotlight solely focused on the sport . 
Let 's get real . 
Are underage drinking and the hiring of strippers activities enjoyed only by college lacrosse players ? 
Of course not . 
Also , should an entire sport be tarnished because one team happened to have a stripper party over <ORGANIZATION>Spring Break</ORGANIZATION> ? 
Once again , I would have to let out a resounding no . 
When the charges against the three players are once and for all proven untrue , who is going help the accused players rebuild their reputations ? 
Who is going to repair the damage done to the lives of the other , uncharged Duke lacrosse players ? 
Who is going to apologize to former <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> coach <PERSON>Mike Pressler</PERSON> whose professional livlihood has been destroyed by the charges ? 
I am sure that it wo n't be the media or <LOCATION>Durham</LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON>Mike Nifong</PERSON> . 
On a personal level , I am also disappointed that this scandal marred <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's perfect national championship season . 
Fair or unfair , people could always point to the fact that the Cavaliers did not have to face a talented <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> squad as a way to minimize <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's amazing achievement . 
As painful as this is for me to say as both a <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> native and a <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> student , I will be rooting for the Duke men 's lacrosse team next season -- except when they play the <ORGANIZATION>Cavaliers</ORGANIZATION> . 
After what the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Devils</ORGANIZATION> have unjustly suffered this year , it is the least that a sports fan can do .
