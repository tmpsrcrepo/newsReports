<PERSON>Porter Dickie</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily Junior forward <PERSON>Anthony Gill</PERSON> is averaging 13.9 points per game since junior guard <PERSON>Justin Anderson</PERSON> fractured his finger in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's last matchup with <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Gill</PERSON> also leads the <ORGANIZATION>Cavaliers</ORGANIZATION> in rebounding at 6.8 per game . 
As the game clock wound down at the <ORGANIZATION>Carrier Dome</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> , a much-anticipated sense of d Ã © j Ã   vu started to sink in for <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> fans , players and coaches alike . 
Despite being down 13-2 with seven minutes to go in the first half , the Cavaliers were able to comfortably defeat <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION> , 59-47 , clinching the ACC regular-season title for the second year in a row . 
" It 's a blessing to be in this position for all of us , " junior guard <PERSON>Malcolm Brogdon</PERSON> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE> , two days before putting up 10 points in the win against the Orange . 
A blessing indeed for a team that has managed to win all but one of its games while relying primarily on stellar defense in a sport often dominated by offense . 
The Cavaliers ( 28-1 , 16-1 ACC ) are currently holding opponents to just under 50 points per game ( 49.9 ) , a feat that has n't been accomplished over an entire season in Division I men 's basketball since <DATE>1992</DATE> , when the <ORGANIZATION>Princeton Tigers</ORGANIZATION> held opponents to 48.2 . 
But recently , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> has been far more than a defensive juggernaut . 
The real story has been <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's ability to overcome the loss of junior guard <PERSON>Justin Anderson</PERSON> , who , despite missing the <ORGANIZATION>Cavaliers</ORGANIZATION> ' last seven games with a fractured pinky , is leading the ACC in 3-point percentage at 48.4 . 
Brogdon is currently netting 13.6 points per game and making <PERCENT>43.5 percent</PERCENT> of his shots . 
Sophomore point guard <LOCATION>London Perrantes</LOCATION> has also gone above and beyond , averaging 4.7 assists per game ( fourth best in the ACC ) to go along with a conference-leading 3.32 assist-to-turnover ratio . 
He dished out a career-high 10 assists <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> . 
However , nobody on the team has done a better job of stepping up than junior forward <PERSON>Anthony Gill</PERSON> , who has averaged 13.9 points per game since the loss of <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> , and currently leads the team with 6.8 rebounds per game . 
He has proven himself to be one of the most consistent scorers on this <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> squad , as evidenced by his physical , down-low play night in and night out . 
And <PERSON>Gill</PERSON> is n't the only <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> forward to have recently elevated his level of play . 
This past Senior Day , as the Cavaliers hosted the <LOCATION>Virginia Tech Hokies</LOCATION> , senior forward <PERSON>Darion Atkins</PERSON> managed 16 points and six rebounds in his final game at <ORGANIZATION>John Paul Jones Arena</ORGANIZATION> . 
But <PERSON>Atkins</PERSON> ' role on this <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier</ORGANIZATION> team goes far beyond his game-day contributions . 
" We would n't be here without <PERSON>Darion</PERSON> today , " <PERSON>Gill</PERSON> said . 
" Just him pushing us in practice all the time - you know , he 's a great leader , and we just feed off of his energy , especially on the defensive end . 
He 's the anchor that we have , and we have to make sure that we 're up to par with <PERSON>Darion</PERSON> . " 
Atkins is one of just three seniors on this <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> team . 
Of those three , he is the only one who consistently sees the court , averaging 23.4 minutes per game this season . 
" He perseveres through so much , " <PERSON>Brogdon</PERSON> said . 
" He did n't play as much freshman year , and then as he 's gotten older and matured he 's started to play way more . 
He 's the key to a lot of our wins this season . " 
Now , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> heads to <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> ( 23-6 , 11-5 ACC ) <DATE>Saturday</DATE> with the sole blemish on its record a heart-breaking loss to No. 3 Duke . 
The Cavaliers are looking to finish the regular season with just one loss , which may seem unbelievable , but is still very feasible . 
Since narrowly losing to <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> in early <DATE>February</DATE> , <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> 's season has been nothing short of tumultuous . 
They suffered a home loss to <ORGANIZATION>NC State</ORGANIZATION> just one week after their strong effort against the <ORGANIZATION>Cavaliers</ORGANIZATION> , and then proceeded to lose again <DATE>four days later</DATE> in a tough matchup against <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> . 
To make matters worse , senior guard <PERSON>Chris Jones</PERSON> was recently dismissed from the team amid allegations of sexual assault . 
Jones was averaging 13.7 points per game and led the ACC with 2.04 steals per game . 
The biggest challenge for the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> defense will be shutting down junior forward and future first-round draft pick <PERSON>Montrezl Harrell</PERSON> , who is averaging 15.4 points and 9.3 rebounds per game this season . 
When asked about <PERSON>Harrell</PERSON> in early <DATE>February</DATE> , <PERSON>Bennett</PERSON> , who knows him from <ORGANIZATION>USA Basketball</ORGANIZATION> , said <PERSON>Harrell</PERSON> is one of the fiercest competitors he 's ever seen . 
" He is a warrior between the lines , " <PERSON>Bennett</PERSON> said . 
" The bigger the game , the bigger the setting , he seems to thrive on that . " 
But with the second-best team in the country vying for a nearly perfect season , <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> is going to have to leave everything on the court if it wants to stand a chance . 
Tipoff against <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> is set for <TIME>6:30 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>KFC</ORGANIZATION> Yum ! 
Center in <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> .
