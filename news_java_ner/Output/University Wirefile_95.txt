A recent <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> ruling stating that colleges can not release files from student judicial proceedings endorses the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> 's conviction that student records from disciplinary proceedings should remain confidential . 
The Court ruled that student disciplinary files qualify as " educational records " under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act , which prohibits disclosure of student records that include personally identifiable information or that the students or parents have not authorized for release by the college . 
The decision emphasized that colleges will be expected to publish annual statistics on the number of crimes on campus , including data on murder , rape , robbery , aggravated assault and hate crimes . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> currently compile such statistics annually . 
University policy now states that student disciplinary records , which could include records of student judicial proceedings , are confidential . 
These records may only become available to someone outside the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> at the student 's request . 
If a student is considered a dependent on his or her parents for tax purposes , parents may access the records but may not request their release to an outside party . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's Honor and <ORGANIZATION>Judiciary Committees</ORGANIZATION> ' constitutions and bylaws maintain that in a trial , the accused has the right to have all personally identifiable information kept confidential and all proceedings held against him to be either private or public . 
Honor Chairman-elect <PERSON>Thomas Hall</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> 's " primary responsibility is confidentiality " for the accused student . 
Law Prof. <PERSON>Robert O'Neil</PERSON> , a former <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> president , said he believes " U.Va . 
policy is partly driven by <LOCATION>FERPA</LOCATION> and partly by our own sensitivities on this issue . " 
<PERSON>O'Neil</PERSON> said the ruling confirms the existing policy at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , so he does not expect to see any alterations in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's judicial proceedings . 
Critics of the ruling argue that colleges will be inclined to hide illegal or potentially embarrassing incidents from the public and that the ruling impairs journalists ' ability to assess and publish reports concerning the fairness of university judicial systems . 
But <PERSON>O'Neil</PERSON> said other viable means of evaluating student judicial systems exist and the undisclosed files are not the sole source of relevant information . 
Honor Education School Rep. <PERSON>Jim Haley</PERSON> said he believes students are capable of maintaining a fair and effective system confidentially . 
Critics also allege the ruling may instigate an increase in crime because it eliminates embarrassment for students on trial . 
But <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> said he disagrees with this argument . 
" When someone is given the single sanction of dismissal , there is no need to publish their name or embarrass them . 
It is inappropriate , " he said . 
<PERSON>Haley</PERSON> said " the primary concern is the confidentiality of the student " and with respect to that principle , he gives the ruling " two thumbs up . " 
<ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman-elect <PERSON>Lissa Percopo</PERSON> said " confidentiality is an educational tool ... Sanctions are more punitive [ rather than educational ] if they are known . "
