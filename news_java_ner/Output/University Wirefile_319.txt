At this university views on sexual mores tend to be monolithic and it is no wonder these views on controversial and complex issues are imposed on students directly from the administration . 
Fraternities are required to attend three education events per semester that teach members about rape , drug use , hazing and the like as a part of their <ORGANIZATION>Fraternal Organization Agreement</ORGANIZATION> . 
Unlike previous semesters , one event was a rally against the Marshall-Newman Marriage Amendment with keynote speaker <PERSON>Julian Bond</PERSON> held <LOCATION>Halloween</LOCATION> . 
The classication of this political event as educational is indicative of the growing insensitivity of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> itself and its community to disagreement on lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender issues . 
Two weeks ago I shared a perspective on sexual assault traditionally overlooked at this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
This week I hope to do the same with the same-sex marriage debate . 
More than a few fraternity men agree that a marriage should be between a man and a woman . 
The community seemed to respond that this belief is not tolerable . 
Some members of the unsympathetic majority of students and faculty at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> have intimidated students who believe that homosexuality is immoral . 
Fourth-year Engineering student <PERSON>Mark Hopke</PERSON> was bullied for his " Gay , not fine by me " sign only last <DATE>spring</DATE> . 
There was such a strong popular vocal uprising against him that <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Students Penny Rue</ORGANIZATION> asked Residence Life to contact him about his well-being . 
Needless to say , two students reported anti-gay bias through the " Just Report It " Web site . 
Some might say that the majority of the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> population as a whole is against homosexuality and that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is a " safe space " for LGBT issues . 
Does that mean we can not also create a " safe space " for the majority of Virginians ? 
Why is it a problem to find homosexuality immoral ? 
A full <PERCENT>59 percent</PERCENT> of Americans oppose same-sex marriage , according to the Pew Forum . 
Freedom of speech is a beautiful thing . 
The best way to appreciate that freedom is to let the people you disagree with the most get up on their respective soapboxes and say whatever they want . 
I am not the only one who believes this . 
In <ORGANIZATION>Smith v. Collins</ORGANIZATION> ( <DATE>1978</DATE> ) , <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> upheld the right of <ORGANIZATION>American Nazis</ORGANIZATION> to march in the predominantly Jewish town of <LOCATION>Skokie</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION> . 
As someone who supports same-sex marriage , I am disgusted at the tactics used on Grounds to coerce people who disagree into silence . 
As a community , we not only need to respect people who feel this way , but we should give them a public forum to express their beliefs without harassment , should they decide to do so . 
Since the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> provided a forum in the <LOCATION>Newcomb Ballroom</LOCATION> for people to speak out against the marriage amendment , we should be willing to allow any group to speak out against same-sex marriage in the same spacious conditions . 
Since same-sex marriage is a touchy issue within the community and support of LGBT issues is the majority opinion , proponents feel safe exerting their opinions as strongly as possible against a much smaller and weaker group of people who think homosexuality is wrong . 
Supporters say this sentiment may be feuled by perceived outside intimidation . 
Like concentric circles , however , those not in favor of homosexuality at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> are at the bottom of the pile .
