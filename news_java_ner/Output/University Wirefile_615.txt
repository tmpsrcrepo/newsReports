This week <ORGANIZATION>the Counseling and Psychological Services</ORGANIZATION> sponsored a series of <ORGANIZATION>Suicide Prevention Training</ORGANIZATION> sessions for staff and faculty at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The training sessions , in response to last semester 's unfortunate student suicides , are one of the first steps the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has taken this semester toward suicide prevention and awareness . 
These steps , however , pale in comparison to the steps that have been taken thus far to prevent sexual assault and promote student safety on Grounds . 
Although these are very different causes , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> needs to devote more time and effort to a cause that was responsible for taking the lives of three <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students last semester . 
Two major developments are taking place at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> right now . 
The first , though not directly caused by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , involves the banning of sororities from attending Boy 's Bid Night . 
This contested decision is a direct response to the Rolling Stone article , and the end goal , presumably , is to prevent sexual assault . 
Although the specific merits of this policy - implemented by the international presidents of <ORGANIZATION>National Panhellenic Conference</ORGANIZATION> sororities - are being disputed , it is a significant measure to combat sexual assault and safety concerns . 
Another major initiative funded by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is the opening of a new police substation across from the Corner , as well as plans to establish a permanent substation this <DATE>summer</DATE> , located in the building once occupied by Freeman-Victorius frame shop . 
Moreover , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> will implement an " ambassadors " program to provide escorts to members of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community at <TIME>night</TIME> and increase the security presence in the area . 
Once again , this is a significant measure that was implemented in response to both the <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> case and the Rolling Stone article . 
Though these suicide prevention training sessions are also in response to the tragedies of last semester , they are not as comprehensive nor as serious as the developments I have outlined above . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Department of Student Health</ORGANIZATION> website emphasizes " research shows that when any community experiences suicide , a likelihood of additional suicides exists in that community in the future . " 
This means that now , more than ever , significant measures must be taken toward spreading awareness . 
<PERSON>Andrea Iglesias</PERSON> , assistant director of outreach and liaison programming for CAPS , said in a Cavalier Daily article that the training is open to everyone in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , yet the department of student health website only mentions that it is for faculty and staff . 
In order to effectively combat suicide and mental illness , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> as well as CAPS must reach out to the whole <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , not just faculty and staff . 
This could be in the form of suicide prevention sessions for students or other awareness events and dialogue . 
Either way , it is crucial that the entirety of our community understand the warning signs of suicide and know possible ways to find help either for themselves or others . 
I am not implying CAPS is not an effective outlet for student help ; in fact , there is a multitude of resources available on the CAPS website . 
The training sessions are a step in the right direction for the cause of suicide prevention . 
Additionally , CAPS is hosting free mental wellness screenings <DATE>February 19th</DATE> . 
Rather , I wish to contrast the actions the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has taken towards combatting sexual assault with those it has taken towards combating suicide and depression . 
The urgency for action , especially after the events of last semester , does not appear to be present . 
Such action may not have to be as large-scale as a police substation or a ban on sorority activities , but there should be a push for awareness nevertheless . 
Last <DATE>October</DATE> , my fellow columnist <PERSON>Lauren Horne</PERSON> brought up a similar argument . 
She focused on the disparity between <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> 's response to a student suicide and a disappearance . 
Yet , her article centered more on the public attention that each case was receiving rather than awareness and prevention efforts themselves . 
This disparity was likely due to the privacy each family wished to have in their time of mourning . 
But at the same time , <PERSON>Horne</PERSON> stresses the need for " open discussion about mental illness , suicide , or how to handle grief . " 
To this end , my argument highlights the need for more significant action this semester , through open discussion and awareness as well as teaching students the warning signs and how to respond . 
These efforts can not keep taking a backseat to the issues of sexual assault and student safety ; rather , they must be elevated to a level of equal or near-equal importance .
