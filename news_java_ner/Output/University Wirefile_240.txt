In the <DATE>fall of 1990</DATE> , an opinion piece about graffiti on the stall walls of a central campus bathroom naming alleged rapists ran in the <ORGANIZATION>Brown Daily Herald</ORGANIZATION> . 
The " underground list " became the center of controversy with claims of unfair accusations and libel . 
" It began with a single sentence inscribed inside a stall , " <PERSON>Jesselyn Alicia Brown</PERSON> writes in " Just Sex . " 
" There , in a forum that guaranteed a female-only audience and anonymity , a woman had written , ' ____________ is a rapist . ' " 
Over time , the list grew as women added additional names along with complaints about <ORGANIZATION>Brown University</ORGANIZATION> 's failure to adequately discipline <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> men who had sexually assaulted female students . 
Imagine the names of rapists written on the stall walls of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> bathrooms here . 
No , I do not support this type of behavior . 
But with the confidentiality rules of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> , it may be the only outlet for sexual assault victims to express themselves . 
Sadly , the administration is not actively addressing the problem effectively . 
The <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> addresses it with the most inept policies , which prevent victims from speaking about an assault after proceedings finish . 
A disturbing article in The Hook , titled " How UVA Turns Its Back on Rape , " illustrates why universities should not be in the business of punishing these cowardly perpetrators , namely because they are not aggressive enough . 
University President <PERSON>John T. Casteen</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>III</ORGANIZATION> said in an e-mail to <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily Opinion</ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON>Elliot Haspel</PERSON> ( " Confronting Sexual Assault , " <DATE>Nov. 17 , 2004</DATE> ) that the administration was looking at several options for addressing sexual assault , but " it is too soon for anyone to say just how we will proceed on this issue . " 
Suggestion : Leave it to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> police departments and the court system . 
If the student is found guilty in court , he should be permenantly expelled . 
Rape is a highly serious violation that destroys the fabric of trust that connects us as students . 
The violator has no right to be here . 
Now , I can hear everyone preaching the community of trust and honor . 
I can hear students lecturing about the importance of " keeping matters in house . " 
But if you missed the news flash , the almighty honor code is not addressing the problem of sexual assault . 
I know you saw the Protest ( capitalized because it 's a proper noun in my dictionary ) on <DATE>Nov. 17</DATE> at the Amphitheater , or at least heard about it . 
I assume the students standing with bandannas across their mouths do not believe the honor code or any other <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policy sufficiently and properly addresses the problem of sexual assault . 
Disturbing as it may seem , the approximate 300 to 400 students standing silent may have a better understanding of the sexual assault epidemic than the administration . 
It is true : statistically , one in four college women will be subjected to attempted or actual rape . 
I sat in class last week and overheard a female student recall how she had seen a man in the bushes a few times last week . 
She called the police , and when they arrived , the man began to run , only to be caught and later identified as a convicted sex offender . 
When two female students later joined the conversation , I told myself that one of these women will be raped according to statistics . 
I did not need that image to make me realize the situation . 
I have befriended many women who were sexually assaulted . 
Unfortunately , some students and administrative officials have not or do not know they have befriended a previously raped woman . 
( It hurts when you are scared to speak out . 
It 's even more terrifying when you are threatened for speaking out ) . 
The rapist alone silences many sexual assault victims . 
Surely the victim does not need another person working to silence the truth . 
Being the group in power , some males may find it hard to recognize the violation . 
Being raised in a blame-the-victim society , some women may think the problem does not exist . 
I can only recommend you educate yourself about the growing problem . 
The worst way to learn about the epidemic is to have it happen to you or someone you know .
