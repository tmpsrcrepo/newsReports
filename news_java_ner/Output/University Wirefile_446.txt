<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring</ORGANIZATION> visited the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Friday</DATE> to discuss the role of the Attorney General 's office with regard to same-sex marriage and campus safety across the commonwealth . 
Herring spent much of the event , which was hosted by the Women , Gender and Sexuality Program , discussing his changing of the state 's position on <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's constitutional same-sex marriage ban . 
Upon taking office , <ORGANIZATION>Herring</ORGANIZATION> said he would not defend the state ban in court - an issue that has drawn increased attention as <PERSON>Bostic v. Rainey</PERSON> , a case challenging the ban , moves through the court system and seems destined for the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> . 
Herring said bans on same-sex marriage not only violate <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> precedent that marriage is a fundamental right , they also violate due process and equal protection under the law by treating same-sex couples as second-class citizens . " 
[ There 's an ] inescapable conclusion that marriage is a fundamental right , " he said . 
He said it the issue comes down to the fact that governments should treat everyone equally . " 
[ It 's ] important to look at these cases and look at what 's new and not new , " he said . 
" What is changing is how that equality of right affects same-sex couples . " 
Herring said he has been criticized for not defending <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's constitutional ban and thus not filling his proper role as attorney general , but said he is not fazed by these accusations . 
" I took an oath to support the Constitution of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and the Constitution of the Commonwealth of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , " he said . 
" When the two conflict , the Constitution of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> trumps [ <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's ] . " 
An audience member questioned Herring as to what might happen if <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> decides not to take up the <PERSON>Bostic</PERSON> case - to which he said the state would have to look at reworking its policies in the state health plan to increase the number benefits available to same-sex couples . 
Nevertheless , he said he was optimistic <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> would decide to hear the case , adding that <PERSON>Bostic</PERSON> is one in a long line of civil rights cases in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . 
He recalled past cases about segregation , interracial marriage , and gender equality , saying <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> has been on the wrong side of the argument in each instance . " 
[ I am ] determined that the injustice of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's position in landmark civil rights cases would not be repeated again , " he said . 
" When our children study this , they will know their Commonwealth was on the right side of the law and on the right side of history . " 
Herring also discussed an initiative to address sexual violence on college campuses . 
He said there are long overdue conversations about a topic with appalling national statistics . 
" Behind those statistics , behind every one of those numbers , is a student whose life has been changed forever , " he said . 
" Sexual violence will not be tolerated , nor will the societal norms that support it . " 
He said his office is looking into innovative ways to prevent sexual assault , including bystander training . 
He said he wants to work with schools to ensure they respond appropriately to reports of sexual assault . 
" No student should feel victimized by a response that is inadequate or inefficient , " he said . 
<PERSON>Charlotte Patterson</PERSON> , director of the WGS program , said the department was delighted to have <ORGANIZATION>Herring</ORGANIZATION> 's input on these issues . 
" He is , as Attorney General , involved in many important events involving Virginians across the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> , " she said . " 
[ There are ] a very notable set of issues that his administration has had to tackle , [ including ] same-sex marriage , which is of great interest to many of our students " She said <ORGANIZATION>Herring</ORGANIZATION> 's perspective and viewpoints are particularly valuable to students in the WGS program . 
" They 're issues that we teach [ and ] talk about , " <PERSON>Patterson</PERSON> said . " 
[ They are ] issues that concern students ' lives , and we 're very lucky to have his input about them . "
