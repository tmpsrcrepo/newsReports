<PERSON>Thomas Bynum</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> announced the launch of a new " It 's On Us " sexual assault prevention initiative <DATE>Friday</DATE> , a new public awareness effort to help curb sexual assault on college campuses . 
The campaign was driven by the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Task Force</ORGANIZATION> to Protect Students from <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault</ORGANIZATION> , convened in <DATE>January 2014</DATE> . 
In <DATE>April</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>Task Force</ORGANIZATION> launched the " 1is2many " public service announcement and the " Not Alone " Report to more effectively address sexual assault on college campuses . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is one of close to 200 universities which have partnered with the " It 's On Us " campaign . 
Associate Dean of Students <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> said her office is considering how the campaign will function with pre-existing sexual assault awareness groups on Grounds . 
" It 's really a media campaign , it 's not really programming what [ groups like ] ' 1 in 4 ' [ does ] , " <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> said . 
" It can certainly enhance and be another component of what they can offer , or how to raise awareness for their own programming . " 
" It 's On Us " stresses the importance of male involvement against sexual misconduct . 
<PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>Office of the Dean of Students</ORGANIZATION> is considering asking the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> to adopt some of the practices advocated by the campaign . 
" We were actually planning to approach some of the men 's athletic teams , " <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> said . 
" NCAA has adopted the program , so I do n't know if it 's actually going to come down from the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> as well . 
... We 're looking at different men 's organizations and how they might integrate into some of their programs since it is focused on engaging men . " 
University alumna <PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> , who worked with the <ORGANIZATION>White House Task Force</ORGANIZATION> last <DATE>spring</DATE> and interns in the <ORGANIZATION>University Office of Student Affairs</ORGANIZATION> , said the new campaign will change the language used to discuss sexual assault prevention . 
" Men were n't particularly engaged with sexual violence prevention because the only thing we were really pushing as part of [ it ] was ' do n't rape people , ' which is not exactly a very proactive thing to tell people to do , " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said . 
" The language is starting to shift more to healthy conversations about healthy sexuality and consent , and having those for both men and women as kind of an engagement point . " 
<PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said the changed approach will involve men who have felt alienated and broadly characterized as perpetrators of sexual violence , as well as women who have felt alienated and broadly characterized as victims . 
" This campaign and the stuff that U.Va . 
is already doing , is irrespective of gender saying ' it is , in fact , our responsibility just as individuals and humans , regardless of our gender , ' " she said . 
" It 's a lot about pulling back on the victim-perpetrator dichotomy we were using before . " 
" It 's On Us " follows the path of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> initiatives like " Hoos Got Your Back " and " Not On Our Grounds " in stressing the importance of bystander education and intervention against sexual assault . 
" We intended for ' Hoos Got Your Back ' to be an introduction to bystander [ intervention ] , and to raise awareness for how important bystanders can be in fighting sexual misconduct , " <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> said . 
" We kind of considered it our first step , and our next step is working on developing and implementing some training programs for students , so I think you 'll see more of that coming towards the end of this semester and into the <DATE>spring</DATE> semester . " 
" It 's On Us " will work alongside the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual assault awareness groups to empower the initiative on Grounds . 
" What [ " It 's On Us " ] will hopefully do is augment the messaging we already have , " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said . 
" The hope is that " It 's On Us " can ... be some sort of sub-campaign within [ the ] broader , more University specific [ groups ] , because we want to keep the language that 's relevant to our community , while still looking into the national prevention effort . "
