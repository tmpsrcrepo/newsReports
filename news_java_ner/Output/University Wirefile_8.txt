CHAUTAUQUA is a quiet town in <LOCATION>upstate New York</LOCATION> , described in The <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post as a " village in the wine and dairy country . " 
It is located on <LOCATION>Chautauqua Lake</LOCATION> -- which the town claims has the cleanest water in the country . 
Last week , however , this serenity was shattered when it was discovered that a 20-year-old sexual predator , <PERSON>Nushawn Williams</PERSON> , had infected at least 11 local young women with the HIV virus , and possibly dozens more . 
Williams has been described by <ORGANIZATION>New York Post</ORGANIZATION> writer <PERSON>Steve Dunleavy</PERSON> as a " walking machine gun of AIDS . " 
He virtually has committed murder , sentencing girls as young as 13 to an early death . 
He was not only promiscuous , but it seems that spreading the virus may have been his plan as he slept with as many as one hundred women in one year and kept detailed records of his actions . 
<PERSON>Robert Berke</PERSON> , health commissioner in <LOCATION>Chautauqua County</LOCATION> said , " This guy is some kind of score-keeper . 
He seems to take delight in keeping records . " 
This is more than just a tragic story and speaks to more than just the actions of one reprehensible individual . 
It puts a spotlight on how AIDS is treated differently from other contagious diseases because of the political consequences of every law regarding this disease . 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> confidentiality laws prevent the identification of people who are HIV positive . 
When someone tests positive for contagious diseases such as tuberculosis , or even other sexually transmitted disease like syphilis , the results must be reported to public health officials who then track the patient 's contacts in an effort to control the spread of the disease . 
This contact-tracing is specifically barred where HIV is involved because of the highly politicized environment surrounding the disease . 
Gay activists argue that this contact-tracing will result in discrimination against the carriers of the virus . 
An <DATE>Oct. 30</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>New York Post</ORGANIZATION> editorial responded , " but the only discrimination going on here is that practiced against <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> ' alleged victims . " 
Privacy is very important , but when the choices are between jeopardizing lives and relinquishing some of this privacy , the choice is clear . 
The fact that the public health department is not allowed to trace this disease , despite important health ramifications , because it is politically popular is outrageous . 
In fact , this confidentiality barrier had to be breached in order to arrest <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Larry Gostin</PERSON> , a professor and health law expert at <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown University</ORGANIZATION> Law center said , " This is the quintessential case where law enforcement should be made aware of a threat to the public . " 
Williams only was identified because a local judge invoked the " imminent risk " exception to the confidentiality requirement . 
But this is the first time this exception has been invoked and only a few states even have this statute . 
There are no requirements for reporting AIDS or contact-tracing for HIV carriers in the state of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> . 
Amazingly , it is not even illegal for an HIV carrier to knowingly participate in unprotected sex -- even though there are criminal penalties for those infected with other STDs . 
By having unprotected sex with dozens of women , and lying about having the AIDS virus , <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> has not clearly violated any law . 
But he is being charged with " first-degree assault " and " reckless endangerment . " 
If convicted , this case will change the way the law treats HIV carriers in regards to unprotected sex . 
Syphilis and gonorrhea are not diseases which command a great deal of political activity . 
AIDS , on the other hand , is . 
But the political nature of a disease should be irrelevant when an epidemic needs to be stopped and when there are lives at stake . 
It seems nonsensical that there should be stiffer regulations for less serious diseases such as gonorrhea or syphilis . 
It is ridiculous to keep the current laws simply because they are politically correct . 
If health issues rather than political issues governed the behavior of the health department , perhaps this tragedy could have been avoided . 
Contact-tracing is used for other STDs , and because it will help slow the AIDS epidemic , it should be instituted for this disease as well , regardless of what is politically correct .
