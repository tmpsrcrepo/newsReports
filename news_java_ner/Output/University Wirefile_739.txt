<PERSON>Jenna Troung</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily The Cavalier Daily provided a Rolling Stone photo editor with this picture in late <DATE>Oct. 2014</DATE> , but was not made aware that it would be modified in any way . 
Associate Dean of Students <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> filed a defamation lawsuit <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> morning against Rolling Stone magazine , <PERSON>Sabrina Rubin Erdely</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Wenner Media</ORGANIZATION> for defamatory statements made against her in Rolling Stone 's <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE> story " A Rape on Campus , " as well as in other media promoting the article . 
The lawsuit follows an open letter <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> sent to Rolling Stone CEO <PERSON>Jann Wenner</PERSON> on <DATE>April 22</DATE> . 
In the letter , <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> described the now-discredited article 's negative impact on <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , on advocacy efforts against sexual assault and on her own professional and personal reputation . 
A statement released by <ORGANIZATION>Eramo</ORGANIZATION> 's law firm , <PERSON>Clare Locke LLP</PERSON> , said that the complaint alleges that Rolling Stone , in publishing the article , aimed to weave a narrative that portrayed the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> as indifferent to rape on campus and as more concerned about protecting the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's reputation . 
" The Complaint alleges that the defendants made the defamatory statements about Dean Eramo recklessly and in purposeful disregard of facts , witnesses , and evidence , in order to present a preconceived storyline that Dean <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> discouraged the reporting of a violent rape to law enforcement because she was more concerned with protecting the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's reputation than with assisting victims of sexual assault , " the press release reads . 
The complaint details specific instances in which " to personify the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's alleged institutional indifference to rape , Erdely and Rolling Stone cast Dean Eramo ... as the chief villain of the story " and <ORGANIZATION>Eramo</ORGANIZATION> 's interactions with <PERSON>Erdely</PERSON> and the magazine 's attorneys . 
The complaint also alleges that Erdely and Rolling Stone continued to make defamatory statements during a publicity tour which followed the article 's publication and its subsequent retraction . 
" The article ... caused a national media firestorm and has been viewed online more than 2.7 million times , " the complaint reads . 
" From <DATE>November 26 , 2014</DATE> until <DATE>December 5 , 2014</DATE> - when Rolling Stone was finally forced to admit publicly that it had lost faith in the story ... - Erdely and <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> continued to conduct a nationwide press tour in which they repeatedly and callously doubled down on their false claims that Dean <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> was indifferent to <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's allegations , that she did nothing in response to them , that she did not report them to the police , and that she instead sought to suppress <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's allegations and discourage her from reporting them . " 
Additionally , according to the complaint , <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> employed a high-profile illustrator to intentionally alter a photo of <LOCATION>Eramo</LOCATION> - originally provided by The Cavalier Daily , though the newspaper was not told the photo would later be modified - to further underscore its false , negative portrayal of Eramo . 
" Rolling Stone retained <PERSON>Ritter</PERSON> Illustrations with the specific intent to portray Dean <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> in a highly negative manner - specifically by causing <PERSON>Ritter</PERSON> to doctor the image in a way to give the appearance of Dean Eramo sitting at her desk , sneering while a sexual assault victim sits crying in front of her , " the complaint reads . 
" A simple comparison of the original photograph and <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> 's manipulated version of the image demonstrates the lengths Erdely and Rolling Stone were willing to go to portray Dean <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> as a villain . " 
The lawsuit , filed in the <ORGANIZATION>Circuit Court</ORGANIZATION> of the City of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , seeks <MONEY>$ 7.5 million</MONEY> in compensatory damages and <MONEY>$ 350,000</MONEY> in punitive damages , in addition to " awarding Dean Eramo all expenses and costs , including attorney 's fees . " 
A fund has been established by an organization called " True Hoos " to raise funds for <ORGANIZATION>Eramo</ORGANIZATION> 's legal fees . 
Students , professors , faculty and other individuals from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community have already raised raised <MONEY>$ 24,000</MONEY> on the crowdfunding website , which lists a goal of <MONEY>$ 500,000</MONEY> . 
Donations have come from individuals such as <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , director of gender violence and social change at the <ORGANIZATION>Women 's Center</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Patricia Lampkin</PERSON> , vice president and chief student affairs officer . 
Parents of current students , and <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> student representative <PERSON>Meg Gould</PERSON> , a <DATE>2015</DATE> College graduate , have also donated to the website .
