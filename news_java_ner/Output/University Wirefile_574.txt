The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has confronted an identity crisis of sorts in the past few weeks , wondering how such a horrendous crime as described in Rolling Stone could occur in our community . 
We now face more questions than answers in an even more unsettling development . 
Now that <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> has retracted their support of an article which left the sanctity of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community in ruins , how do we continue ? 
The report shook our trust in the administration . 
Now new information shatters our trust in the report . 
How do we find a solid ground to stand on ? 
Our understanding of this specific case - <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's - has changed . 
Some details reported in Rolling Stone 's article have been disputed , and some of us may be unsure whom we should believe . 
The advocacy community has said repeatedly - " believe survivors " - that is what you can do to help solve this problem at our university . 
Some may now wonder how we can continue to believe , when some facts about the case are in question . 
Part of the answer is to understand trauma . 
Many have come to <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's defense , arguing that because traumatic memories are often fragmented , some inconsistencies in survivors ' stories do not mean they are lying . 
There is a big difference between fact-checking and rape-denial . 
<PERSON>Kirsten Lombardi</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Public Integrity</ORGANIZATION> , who has significant experience reporting on college rape cases , said rigorously checking a survivor 's story does not mean she does n't believe them . 
The fact-checking and balancing process only makes the story stronger . 
All parties should get a chance for their stories to be heard - that is a principle of good journalism , as it is a principle of the justice system . 
And those systems need to be fair for everyone , if we are ever going to say we 've uncovered what is truly wrong , and reached a solution that is truly right . 
Because Rolling Stone did not thoroughly fact-check the story , the reputation of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity has been damaged by a case which is unproven , and all trauma survivors will now more likely face accusations that their claims are false . 
Rolling Stone 's exploitation of a trauma survivor for the sake of a top headline rather than the sake of the truth has undermined our confidence in the cultural shift we were hoping for . 
We want to live in a world where rape survivors are confident enough to speak up - to the police , to their universities , to the media - when they have been wrongly treated . 
We do n't want to live in a world where rape survivors are resistant to coming forward because they fear they will be dismissed . 
Because if they never come forward , we never even have a chance to investigate and punish the perpetrators who have wronged them , and who have wronged our community . 
Though the facts of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's story are uncertain at this point , there are several facts about the larger issue which we have long known are true . 
Twenty <PERCENT>five percent</PERCENT> of college women are sexual assault survivors . 
Fewer than <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> of college women who are raped report to law enforcement . 
Fraternity men are three times as likely to commit rape as non-fraternity men . 
All these statistics have not changed - with the release of the Rolling Stone article or the retraction of it . 
And all of these statistics still must change . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community must not let the Rolling Stone fiasco disrupt the momentum we need to change these statistics . 
We still stand by all of the arguments we have made thus far on the issue of sexual violence at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
We still need individual change in addition to institutional change . 
And we must hold onto the hope that we can accomplish both .
