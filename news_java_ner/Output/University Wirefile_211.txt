<ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> officials are saying they plan to file charges with the <ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> in the wake of hazing allegations against the local <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Mu</ORGANIZATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION>Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Grand Council of Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> undertook independent investigations into alleged misconduct at the fraternity in early <DATE>November</DATE> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> conducted its investigation through the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life</ORGANIZATION> , which since has been concluded and turned over to the <ORGANIZATION>Vice President for Student Affairs Office</ORGANIZATION> . 
" University judiciary charges will be filed in this case , " said <PERSON>Aaron Laushway</PERSON> , assistant dean of students and director of fraternity and sorority life . 
Vice President for Student Affairs <PERSON>Patricia Lampkin</PERSON> verified there is alleged hazing in the case which has been brought to her office , but could not confirm whether the allegations implicate an individual or an organization . 
" We are treating the allegations seriously and will respect the confidentiality of judicial rules throughout the process , " <PERSON>Lampkin</PERSON> said . 
Alpha Mu chapter President <PERSON>Russell Prestipino</PERSON> declined to comment yesterday on " anything pertaining to <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> . " 
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's hazing statute requires the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to investigate and assess allegations of hazing , and subsequently report those findings to the state when they cause bodily harm . 
" If a public university finds a student or group of students to have committed hazing that results in bodily injury , then the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has to report the hazing to the state 's Commonwealth attorney , " said <PERSON>Madelyn Wessel</PERSON> , special advisor to the vice president for student affairs . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's hazing policy as outlined in the <ORGANIZATION>Undergraduate Record</ORGANIZATION> covers a broader range than the state 's criterion and includes actions which produce " mental or physical harassment , discomfort , or ridicule . " 
" A group or individuals accused of hazing can be brought both up on criminal charges and to the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Wessel</PERSON> said . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee Chair Alexis Gregorian</ORGANIZATION> could neither confirm nor deny whether charges have been brought against the organization or individuals in this case . 
Potential sanctions against an organization found guilty of hazing could include revocation of its <ORGANIZATION>Fraternal Organization Agreement</ORGANIZATION> , mandatory changes to its bylaws or the institution of community service for its members . 
" The most severe would be revoking the FOA -- that 's kind of similar to expelling a student , " <PERSON>Gregorian</PERSON> said . 
Sanctions for an individual convicted of hazing would vary as in any trial on the basis of a crime 's severity . 
Previously , hazing cases had carried a state-mandated expulsion criterion but no longer do . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> did not undertake its own investigation into the hazing allegations but fully supported the efforts of those already undertaken , <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Ryan Ewalt</PERSON> said . 
As a result of the <ORGANIZATION>Delta Sigma Phi Grand Council</ORGANIZATION> investigation , the national organization suspended the charter of the <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Mu</ORGANIZATION> chapter at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> and decided to reorganize the chapter " immediately . " 
Laushway said the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life</ORGANIZATION> is cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION>Grand Council</ORGANIZATION> following the suspension and decision to reorganize . 
" It means the national organization will basically run the chapter , " he said . 
Some current <ORGANIZATION>Delta Sigma Phi</ORGANIZATION> brothers can remain members of the fraternity following the reorganization , as opposed to a complete fraternity recolonization in which all current members are relegated to alumni status or expelled . 
Prestipino said the national <ORGANIZATION>Delta Sigma Phi</ORGANIZATION> organization will use three levels of membership to assess current brothers . 
Current members can either be deemed " a brother in good standing " or expelled from the fraternity altogether . 
A brother also can be suspended until after he graduates upon which time he would receive status as an alumni member of <ORGANIZATION>Delta Sigma Phi</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I do n't know how long it 's going to take , " <PERSON>Prestipino</PERSON> said in reference to the reorganization . 
Laushway said the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life</ORGANIZATION> still is recognizing the local <ORGANIZATION>Delta Sigma Phi</ORGANIZATION> chapter as a fraternity with the provision it cooperates with the national organization . 
The chapter still has its FOA and charter -- therefore it remains a member of the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Suspend does not mean terminate -- there 's an important distinction there , " <PERSON>Ewalt</PERSON> said . 
The local chapter will participate in <DATE>Spring</DATE> rush and recruitment under the supervision of its national organization . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> will support their reorganization however we can , " <PERSON>Ewalt</PERSON> said .
