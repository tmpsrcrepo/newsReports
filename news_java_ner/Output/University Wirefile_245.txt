Student journalism is far from perfect , and publications on Grounds , this newspaper included , are no exception . 
But over the past three weeks , coverage of <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> issues by one of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> 's " professional " news organs has made student reporters look like seasoned veterans in comparison . 
The Hook , which lauds itself as " <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> 's best weekly newspaper , " has done our community the disservice of poorly covering university topics in each of its past three issues . 
Three weeks ago , The Hook 's cover story , " How U.Va . 
Turns its Back on Rape , " lambasted administrators for insufficient prosecution of accused sexual assault . 
The next week 's cover story , " The Verdict : <PERSON>Sisk</PERSON> 's Family Speaks Out , " questioned the three-year sentence doled out to former student <PERSON>Andrew Alston</PERSON> after he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter . 
And last week , in a follow-up , the paper reported on the <DATE>Nov. 17</DATE> university protest against sexual assault . 
In all three articles , Hook reporters cast aside the most basic journalistic principle , objectivity , in favor of viciously slanted reporting . 
Instead of offering the facts , the paper marred coverage of serious topics with manipulation and blatant invective . 
In the spirit of objectivity , it is important to note that organizations like The Hook frequently defend unconventional reporting by noting that they are not normal newspapers but rather " alternative weeklies , " publications that offer news intertwined with opinion . 
That said , there is a right and wrong way to approach alternative news , something The Hook has yet to grasp . 
Alternative weeklies attempt to compete with mass-market newspapers by offering news coupled with intelligent opinion , savvy wit and reasoned commentary . 
Therefore , readers do not expect the same objective approach to reporting they demand from <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> . 
But readers do not expect propaganda either . 
Good alternative news presents the same facts found in objective reporting . 
Rather than manipulate them , it infuses them with opinion , allowing well-reported , balanced facts to support an underlying assertion . 
Sadly , The Hook 's coverage of recent university events does not measure up to this standard . 
The Hook 's <DATE>Nov. 11</DATE> cover story detailed the experience of a student who accused another student of rape . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University 's Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> convicted the accused student , though law enforcement authorities found insufficient evidence to prosecute him . 
The Hook 's story took the accuser 's side from the beginning , immediately labeling her a victim even though the accused maintains his innocence . 
A painstaking narrative of the accuser 's version of events , which vilifies the accused by name , was provided and supplemented with vehement castigation of university policy and assorted quotes decrying the current state of affairs . 
But not until the <DATE>second half of the article</DATE> did the writer deign to allow the accused student a brief response . 
In an e-mail , the news editor of The Hook denied allegations of intentionally slanted reporting , noting that some stories appear lopsided due to an " imbalance of sources . " 
But in such a situation , good journalism gives equal position to opposing opinions , however brief , and juxtaposes skewed opinion with balanced factual reporting . 
The Hook took another route . 
While the story was replete with emotional assault against accused assailants and the university , it dismissed the painful possibility of false prosecution and declined to investigate the complexity of sexual assault policies on campus . 
There was certainly a valid story to be told , but instead of presenting it , The Hook published what amounted to an ad hominem attack on a student and a condemnation of administrators that resorted to sentimentality and sophomorically buried opposing viewpoints under layers of diatribe . 
The Hook 's <DATE>Nov. 18</DATE> coverage of the <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> trail 's outcome was no better . 
From the lead sentence , the article implied <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> 's sentencing was lax . 
Once again , the writer inked line after line of emotional critique , complemented by downcast photos of <PERSON>Walker Sisk</PERSON> 's family and unsubstantiated tirades by <PERSON>Sisk</PERSON> 's friends . 
And once again , any contrary opinion was buried pages into the story . 
Instead of discussing both families ' grief and dissatisfaction , the story made repeated jabs at the <PERSON>Alston</PERSON> family 's wealth and avoided citing opinion contrary to that of <PERSON>Sisk</PERSON> 's acquaintances . 
Last week , The Hook 's coverage of the <DATE>Nov. 17</DATE> silent sexual assault protest was pitched as a follow-up to the cover story on rape . 
Like the cover story , the <DATE>Nov. 25</DATE> article painted a black-and-white picture : Outraged protesters diametrically opposed to the administration . 
In reality , event organizers stressed that they did not blame the university and simply wanted to raise awareness and work productively toward a solution . 
No news , not even the alternative variety , ought to take sides . 
Even coverage with a message must avoid sensationalism and manipulation . 
Intelligent , professional writing is able to present objective facts in a balanced manner and still make a point . 
Unfortunately , The Hook has chosen to treat our community 's most sensitive topics in a remarkably unprofessional manner . 
Not only do good journalists have an obligation to report fairly , but objective consideration inevitably makes a pointed argument stronger . 
Even a rookie knows that .
