Sixty days . 
That 's the jail timeout of a possible life sentence thata child rapist was sentenced to on <DATE>Jan. 4</DATE> after he admitted to sexually assaulting a girl from the age of six for a period of four years . 
While this ruling should sound completely absurd to all of us , akin to something straight out of a twisted courtroom drama movie , it 's reality for <PERSON>Mark Hulett</PERSON> , a sex offender from <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> . 
Believe it or not , this one sentence is not an aberration to the system ; to defend the sentence , <PERSON>Hulett</PERSON> 's attorney <PERSON>Mark Kaplan</PERSON> pointed out that it was n't drastically different from other <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> courts ' rulings -- something that should trouble everyone . 
This extremely lenient sentence is wrongheaded and imprudent , and the philosophy behind it is equally unsound . 
This ruling stemmed from Judge <PERSON>Edward Cashman</PERSON> 's belief in the relative unimportance of punishment . 
He commented during the original sentencing that it " accomplishes nothing of value . 
It does n't make anything better . " 
Instead of jail time , <PERSON>Cashman</PERSON> felt that <PERSON>Hulett</PERSON> should be released as soon as possible so he could get sex offender treatment . 
<PERSON>Hulett</PERSON> was apparently classified as a low-risk repeat offender by the corrections department in <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> and , according to the law , was not eligible for treatment until he was released from jail . 
Regardless , this classification should n't have had any sway over <PERSON>Cashman</PERSON> 's decision . 
According to <ORGANIZATION>The Burlington Free Press</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Mike Smith</PERSON> , secretary of the <ORGANIZATION>Agency of Human Services</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> , clarified that the ranking system was created merely for the corrections department 's internal use and " never intended to be used by judges to determine a sentence . " 
<PERSON>Cashman</PERSON> 's logic in this case is flawed in many aspects . 
Primarily , he judged actual punishment ( i.e. prison time ) inferior to sex offender treatment when given an ultimate choice between the two . 
Sex offender treatment is ambiguous as a means of reducing repeat sex crimes drastically . 
A study released in <DATE>2001</DATE> by the Center for Sex Offender Management , which falls under the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Justice</ORGANIZATION> , reported that one type of treatment , the cognitive behavioral approach , " holds considerable promise " in lowering recidivism rates , which , according to one review cited in the study , ranged from seven to <PERCENT>35 percent</PERCENT> for rapists and 10 to <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> for child molesters . 
The Association for the <ORGANIZATION>Treatment of Sexual Abusers</ORGANIZATION> even admits on its Web site that " treatment does not work equally well for all offenders . " 
According to the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Globe</ORGANIZATION> " Experts found that <PERSON>Hulett</PERSON> was in a group of sex offenders who are harder to treat than others and that he would need a lifetime of supervision . " 
In short , <PERSON>Cashman</PERSON> felt that an option that has n't yet been definitively proven effective on a wide scale would be more appropriate than jail time for a candidate that was deemed difficult to treat from the outset . 
This is not to say that treatment is not beneficial in some cases ; some evidence indicates that the rate of recidivism is slightly lower , on average , for some who undergo treatment ( depending on a wide range of factors ) , and many states have implemented some sort of treatment program . 
However , treatment should never absolve a serious jail sentence . 
Secondly , the idea that a longer punishment will diminish the chance for lower recidivism is misguided . 
Obviously , more time spent in jail is less time spent outside of jail where a sex offender could commit more crimes . 
Eighteen states have passed or are currently deliberating over some form of " Jessica 's Law " in light of the high-profile rape and murder of <PERSON>Jessica Lunsford</PERSON> last year , which calls for stricter sentences and usually a minimum 25 year sentence for sex crimes involving children . 
Additionally , recidivism rates drop as age increases . 
In <DATE>February 2004</DATE> , The <ORGANIZATION>Minnesota Department of Safety</ORGANIZATION> cited a <DATE>2003</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Justice</ORGANIZATION> statistics study which concluded , " The older the prisoner at the time of release , the less likely they were to re-offend ; the lowest recidivism rates were for sex offenders age 45 or older . " 
Aside from the practical faults of the decision , the spirit in which it was decided is disconcerting . 
The judge told the victim 's family they should n't be angry at <PERSON>Hulett</PERSON> , and he believed a lengthy prison sentence was n't necessary . 
What about paying a debt to society after committing a heinous act ? 
It 's hard to envision justice being served in a scenario such as this . 
We live in a nation of laws . 
When a person breaks a law , he should be punished fittingly . 
On <DATE>Jan. 11</DATE> , the state of <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> proposed sex-offender treatment for <PERSON>Hulett</PERSON> in prison , which was mean to influence <PERSON>Cashman</PERSON> to toughen the sentence . 
After much publicity , protests , state government pressure and national media attention , Judge <PERSON>Cashman</PERSON> changed the sentence to a minimum of three years ( maximum of 10 ) last <DATE>Thursday</DATE> following a motion filed by the prosecution . 
There is a silver lining in <LOCATION>Cashman</LOCATION> 's actions -- they have evoked an outcry among <LOCATION>Vermont</LOCATION> representatives for an examination of sex offender statutes -- which will hopefully inhibit any more injudicious sentences .
