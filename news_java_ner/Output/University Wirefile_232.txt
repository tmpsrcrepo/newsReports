In a <DATE>1983</DATE> study by Malamuth regarding attitudes toward women , <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of college men interviewed said they would rape a women if they could be assured they would never be caught . 
In <DATE>1989</DATE> , Pirog-Good and Stets reported that <PERCENT>39 percent</PERCENT> of male students interviewed believed it was " all right " to force sex if a girl was " stoned " or " drunk . " 
In the <DATE>1995</DATE> documentary " Dream Worlds 2 , " narrator <PERSON>Sut Jhally</PERSON> references a survey that reveals <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of men believe women provoke rape by provocative or suggestive dress . 
According to the same survey , <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of women shared the same belief . 
The dates change , but the mindset remains the same . 
As the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> parades the globe attempting to address the violations of women , it completely ignores the culture of violation that exists in its own backyard -- the rape culture . 
" Rape culture is a culture that accepts gender-motivated attacks as normal , natural and even sexy -- a culture whose models of masculinity , femininity and sexuality sustain and rationalize men 's violence against women , " <PERSON>Martha McCaughey</PERSON> writes in " Just Sex . " 
In the book , a collection of essays edited by <ORGANIZATION>Judi Gold</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Susan Villari</PERSON> , students assume the tough task of rewriting the " rules on sex , violence , activism and equality . " 
In the preface , Gold says the book is part of " a movement that believes in Just Sex -- consensual responsible , equitable , inclusive and free of sexual violence . " 
Working against this " Just Sex " movement is the socialization of men as aggressive and women as passive , which perpetuates a system of male violence . 
Therefore , " Rape is not aberrant behavior , but a natural extension of a system that must maintain male dominance , " Gold and <PERSON>Villari</PERSON> write . 
In this culture , men learn to express any type of feeling as aggression . 
When threatened , men do anything to pose a larger threat , <PERSON>Stephen Montagna</PERSON> writes in one of the book 's essays . 
" In such an arena , women become both targets of criticism and objects we use ; the stories we tell each other about what we do with women on dates ( or claim to have done ) become tools used to maintain status among our circle of men , " <PERSON>Montagna</PERSON> says . 
Images in movies and music videos work to perpetuate this culture of violence against women . 
Music videos -- " Tip Drill , " " Girls on Film " and " P-Poppin ' " for example -- display women as nymphomaniacs anxious to participate in a sexual orgy . 
Songs -- for example , " Back That Thang Up " -- emphasize a woman 's body part as her sole worth . 
Further , the images of violence against women in pornography reaffirm male aggressiveness and female passiveness . 
Sadly , " one-dimensional women placed in powerless and vulnerable positions , devoid of thoughts and feelings , " rampant in pornographic magazines , becomes the first sexual experience for many adolescent boys , <PERSON>Krista Jacob</PERSON> writes . 
By all these images , men are taught to see women as objects waiting to be played with . 
In the book , <PERSON>Nate Barnett</PERSON> with <PERSON>Michael Disabato</PERSON> ask what message is sent about our society when former <ORGANIZATION>Indiana University</ORGANIZATION> and current <ORGANIZATION>Texas Tech</ORGANIZATION> head basketball coach <PERSON>Bobby Knight</PERSON> says , " If rape is inevitable , relax and enjoy it . " 
Rape culture needs to be a political issue in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , as it is in other countries . 
We need a feminist analysis of rape culture that " requires that we understand violence against women in terms of the social , political and economic factors that engender a male-dominated patriarchal culture and perpetuate the subordinate status of women , " according to <PERSON>Jacobs</PERSON> . 
Despite the aberrant depictions of sexuality , we must refrain from taking the easy way out with censorship of media outlets . 
As a society , we need to overcome this censorship impulse we have at the current moment and work to create a more expansive discussion about sex and violence to better inform the adults and , most importantly , the children of our society .
