With noon sun glowing on her freckled face , <ORGANIZATION>Claudia Ford</ORGANIZATION> sipped on a freshly made strawberry smoothie and glanced at three girls wearing pastel-pink tutus last <DATE>Monday</DATE> . 
" Oh , my daughter loves to wear those ! " 
said <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> , a visiting environmental sciences scholar at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> , with an excitement normally reserved for kids in candy stores . 
She was talking about <PERSON>Vyanna</PERSON> , her 3-year-old adopted daughter and the inspiration for her book , " Why Do I Scream at God for the Rape of Babies ? " 
which she will be signing at Quest Bookshop <DATE>Thursday</DATE> . 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> is also a lecturer at <ORGANIZATION>the University of the Witwatersrand</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> and works in international development . 
Ford met her future daughter at a hospital in <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> on <DATE>Dec. 10 , 2001</DATE> . 
Just <DATE>one week earlier</DATE> , the 5-month-old baby had been raped by two of her birth mother 's male acquaintances . 
The incident occurred in the baby 's home , a dilapidated theater in <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> that showed pornographic films around the clock and rented cubicles to prostitutes for <MONEY>$ 3.50</MONEY> a night . 
The baby 's birth mother , one of the prostitutes , returned that day to find her daughter in a mess of blood and in pain . 
Alone . 
The baby was rushed to the hospital and operated on immediately . 
" Your bedside is cluttered with official-looking people doing things to you and for you , women and men wearing the uniforms and impedimenta of their jobs . 
Stethoscopes , notebooks , cameras , needles and charts . 
Nurses , journalists , doctors , social workers and police . 
I ache to push the others roughly out of my way and beat a path to your crib . " 
* " I was feeling so many different emotions at the same time , " <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said , bringing to mind the moments just before she met her daughter . 
" I was horrified and I did n't really know what I was going to see . 
And the first thing I saw was a light beam in this little round face and these big black eyes staring at everybody as if she knew everything that was going on . 
It was overwhelming how small she was , and this aura of innocence that did n't square with the whole tragedy . " 
When <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> discovered the hospital was planning to release the infant , she volunteered to take her home . 
" I felt I had to do something , " <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" To walk away from her -- I could n't do it . 
I tried to come up with an excuse , but there was no way I could do it . " 
" Do children choose their parents ? 
I always used to say so , half jokingly . 
Have you chosen me ? " 
The baby never cried . 
Often left by her birth mother for upwards of eight hours alone in the porn theater , the infant had learned crying did n't do much . 
Ford described it this way : for the first five months of her life , the baby " was the loneliest person in the world . " 
" She was a baby who had to learn to survive , " <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" And no infant should have to do that . " 
When <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> took her home , she gave the infant everything the little one had been missing . 
Stability . 
Comfort . 
Attention . 
Love . 
" We quickly made her into a diva , " <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" It took a few weeks of food , songs and stories before you felt secure enough to really sleep . 
Then you fell into the ocean of deep and dreamless rest that belongs to babies , sinking into my down duvet and my love -- your life raft . " 
The arrangement was only supposed to last a little while . 
" I was telling my oldest son Juma about it , and I said it was just temporary , " <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" And he said ' You , mom ? 
Temporary ? 
Yeah right . ' " 
Sure enough -- after arduous months of courts , hospitals and social service offices -- the baby became <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> 's legally adopted daughter . 
Ford named her Vyanna . 
" I do realize her life has changed completely . 
My life has changed completely . " 
Now , despite the horrors she has suffered , <PERSON>Vyanna</PERSON> ( nicknamed Princess Moonbeam by <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> ) is a healthy and happy child -- a child whose mother beams and giggles at every mention of her daughter . 
" Probably a lot of people on Grounds have already seen her , " <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" She 's always dancing on stage . 
She 's a charismatic , high energy , outgoing , dancing , singing , normal terrorist 3-year old . " 
But then there are the children who have n't been so lucky , who are n't taken in and pampered and who continue to have nothing but their own survival . 
What happens to them ? 
That 's where " Why Do I Scream at God for the Rape of Babies ? " 
comes in . 
Through the book , <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> aims to spread awareness of child sexual abuse and fight the silence surrounding rape . 
Even the title is a call to action . 
" I used to scream at God for allowing babies to be raped , until I realized that in allowing babies to be raped God was screaming at me . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said she could n't remember where she heard that statement , but its significance struck her : It is in our hands to do something . 
And <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> is doing something . 
Fifty-one percent of the proceeds from the book are going to " research , prevention and treatment of child sexual abuse , " through an organization <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> founded , the Princess Trust . 
" I want to be able to look my daughter in the eyes and tell her that what happened to her will never happen to another little girl ever again ... " Crucial as it is to battle ignorance , <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> admitted the book was born out of a need to put the experience in writing for her Princess Moonbeam -- and this need remains <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> 's priority . 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said it was probably a more selfish goal that motivated her to write . 
" It started from me wanting a record for her , " <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" A story that she and I can create to make sense of what happened by developing almost a fairytale for her -- a story for her . " 
The book is also a bold answer to those who wonder if <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> should shelter Vyanna from knowing what happened . 
" I would never dream of not telling her , " <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" You may not remember , but I must assume that you might . " 
Even now , <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> is paving the way for her daughter to unravel the truth . 
" Since she 's been two years old , every night I tell her how special she is , " <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" And as I keep telling her , one day she 'll ask me , ' Why am I special , Mommy ? ' " 
" My daughter is not to blame for what happened to her . 
She will always know that this horrid crime is not who she is -- it is just a thread in the tapestry of her as yet unfinished story . " 
" Why " is a diary , spanning the two years since <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> first met Vyanna . 
Its entries are peppered with an eclectic mix of fairytales , letters , poetry and even an academic paper -- a bundle of <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> 's efforts to both understand and publicize the horror that befell her daughter . 
To understand . 
" How many tears of frustration have I now cried over this damn colostomy bag anyway ? 
I watch her crawling around the house with a bag of poop hanging off her waist and it infuriates me . 
It is a constant reminder of what has happened to her . " 
Why would anyone even fathom doing such a thing ? 
In her book , <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> says she knows she does n't have that answer , but eventually she will have to provide one for her daughter . 
To publicize . 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said some estimate that in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> , there are 200-300 rapes of children under 12 years old every day . 
Many have suggested the myth that having sex with a virgin cures disease is largely responsible for this pandemic . 
But <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> pointed out that the virgin myth has existed in many cultures throughout history ; it is not unique to the situation of AIDS and <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> . 
She does n't believe the virgin myth motivated her daughter 's rapists . 
" They were stupid , drunk , " <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" I do n't think it was premeditated . 
It was just ... evil . " 
The men who raped <PERSON>Vyanna</PERSON> were released on lack of evidence and insufficient witness testimony . 
And although punishments are harsh for those convicted of sexual crimes , <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said , <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> continues to be known as the rape capital of the world . 
" The particular combination of apartheid and traditional patriarchal views just led to this strange mixture where women were victimized sexually as a part of the struggle , so the townships -- there were gangs , and part of their rite of passage was raping women , " <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" And that was both urban and rural . 
So it 's just really terrible mixture of those things that 's led to a very violent society . " 
How to even begin battling this brutality ? 
<ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said she believes it comes down to a fundamental problem of how societies relate to children . 
Ideally , she said , children should be seen as objects of love and nurturance . 
With child labor , child slavery and child sexual abuse so widespread , <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said , it 's clear the world does n't cherish the innocence of its children . 
" I plunge into the roiling sea of studies on crime , violence and masculinity with my intellectual curiosity as a life line . 
You sit , wide-eyed and quietly ... " Another issue that <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> is studying in her efforts to understand child sexual abuse is the way parents bring up their sons , often equating violence and aggression with masculinity . 
" Part of my thesis has to do with the socialization of men as boys , " <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" Obviously because I have sons , and I looked at this little girl , and I looked at my three sons , and I thought , ' well hang on a second , there 's no way they would do this to a five-month-old baby . ' 
So what did I do differently as a mother , as a parent , that I could raise three men who would n't dream of doing this ? " 
And those three men love their baby sister . 
" She has three brothers who idolize her , and she adores them , " <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said . 
Does <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> worry that <ORGANIZATION>Vyanna</ORGANIZATION> will grow up traumatized , despite the love of her adopted family ? 
That the scars will never heal ? 
" We all have trauma , " <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said simply . 
She added that she 's more concerned with helping her daughter deal with being an adopted child . 
Ford has already begun to do research in that area . 
" My friend said to me , ' <PERSON>Claudia</PERSON> , you want to change the world . ' 
And I said , ' Yeah , I probably do . 
And I 'll do it one baby at a time , ' " <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> said .
