Students at <ORGANIZATION>James Madison University</ORGANIZATION> have expressed resentment at the <ORGANIZATION>JMU Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> ' decision to discontinue the availability of the emergency contraception drug from <ORGANIZATION>JMU</ORGANIZATION> 's student health center . 
The <ORGANIZATION>JMU Student Government Association</ORGANIZATION> is working toward putting the issue of Emergency Contraception on the agenda for the <ORGANIZATION>Student Senate</ORGANIZATION> . 
" On <DATE>Monday</DATE> we began passing a petition trying to get enough signatures for a Bill of Opinion , " <ORGANIZATION>Student Government Association</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Levar Stoney</PERSON> said . 
The Bill of Opinion is a bill that prioritizes an issue for the student senate . 
" When we have a huge issue on campus , we use the bill to express that , " <PERSON>Stoney</PERSON> said . 
" It 's just a first step in making sure the <ORGANIZATION>BOV</ORGANIZATION> hears us loud and clear . " 
According to <LOCATION>Stoney</LOCATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>SGA</ORGANIZATION> is now writing letters to the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> to rally more support and also are planning a march to <ORGANIZATION>Board Member Mark Obenshain</ORGANIZATION> 's law office . 
" We are also sending a letter to Delegate [ <PERSON>Bob ] Marshall</PERSON> , " he said . 
" We ca n't believe a Delegate from <LOCATION>Manasses</LOCATION> is writing to <LOCATION>Harrisonburg</LOCATION> about an issue . " 
Many <ORGANIZATION>JMU</ORGANIZATION> students believe that the <ORGANIZATION>BOV</ORGANIZATION> was exercising too much power when they decided to prevent students from being able to purchase emergency contraceptive on campus , <PERSON>Stoney</PERSON> said . 
" The BOV crossed the line and micromanaged student services which I believe is out of their realm , " he said . 
JMU 's health center does not carry all drugs and this would just be another drug that can not be purchased on campus , said student <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON>Andrew Dudik</PERSON> . 
" It 's not eliminating the rights of doctors to prescribe the contraception , " he said . 
Stoney disagreed . 
" It 's unfortunate that the <ORGANIZATION>BOV</ORGANIZATION> forgot to include student opinion on this issue , " <PERSON>Stoney</PERSON> said . 
There is some debate over the motive of the <ORGANIZATION>BOV</ORGANIZATION> in suggesting the contraception 's removal from the campus pharmacy . 
" Since the letter from <PERSON>Bob Marshall</PERSON> , it appeared to be political , " said <PERSON>Ann Simmons</PERSON> , coordinator for health promotion at <ORGANIZATION>JMU</ORGANIZATION> . 
Dudik refuted claims that the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> acted politically . 
" I can understand why they have concerns . 
Unfortunately , I think a lot of their concerns are unfounded , " he said . 
" They thought the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> was taking a political stand , but I have n't known the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> to do that at all -- we do n't want JMU to be in the business to hand out something so controversial . " 
The student health center encouraged students to voice their opposition to the prohibition of the drugs in the campus pharmacy . 
" I 'm very pleased that the students have found their voice around an issue that is important to them and have decided to take a stand and have done so in such a prompt and deliberate manner , " said <PERSON>Marsha Mays-Bernard</PERSON> , director of the <ORGANIZATION>JMU</ORGANIZATION> student health center . 
" We 've certainly been supportive of the students , and supporting them in their stance at this point is probably the most significant thing we can do . " 
Emergency contraceptives may not require a prescription in the future . 
" The company that is making the pill is petitioning for it to be over the counter , " said <ORGANIZATION>JMU Director of University Communications Fred Hilton</ORGANIZATION> . 
Students want to affirm the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> is working for their benefit and not political purposes , according to student leaders . 
" I feel that one of the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> members who is running for office is putting it on his platform , " Freshman class president <PERSON>Wesli Spencer</PERSON> said . 
" It 's a career move and is not for the betterment of the student body . " 
Some students said they feel politics should not affect the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I am tired of people playing politics with higher education , " <PERSON>Stoney</PERSON> said . 
Other students said they are more focused on the usefulness of the emergency contraceptive . 
" I just think that stuff should be available to students , especially in cases of rape and drunkenness , " <ORGANIZATION>JMU</ORGANIZATION> freshman <PERSON>Lauren LaMesa</PERSON> said .
