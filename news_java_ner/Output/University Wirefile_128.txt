Of all the things students could concentrate on in the world beyond <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , human rights violations in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> probably do n't top the list often . 
They 're probably not high priority for the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> either . 
But if <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> is contributing -- even indirectly -- to the Burmese government 's inhumane acts , the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> must immediately recognize that this is a problem and fix it . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has <MONEY>$ 2.5 million</MONEY> invested in companies that do business in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> , a country ruled by a military dictatorship . 
Of these funds , <MONEY>$ 2.1 million</MONEY> is invested in <LOCATION>Unocol</LOCATION> , an oil company that built an enormous pipeline in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> through the use of forced labor and the relocation of thousands of villagers . 
This pipeline is a huge source of funding for the dictatorship , so by investing in <LOCATION>Unocol</LOCATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> helps fund a regime that regularly violates the rights of its people . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has invested only a small fraction of its money in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> . 
It 's true that losing a couple <MONEY>million dollars</MONEY> wo n't make much of a difference to the Burmese regime , but many other universities and businesses also are withdrawing investments in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> . 
Largely because of student boycotts , <ORGANIZATION>Pepsi</ORGANIZATION> stopped conducting business in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> . 
Other big names like <ORGANIZATION>Reebok</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Levi Strauss</PERSON> have withdrawn as well . 
Students at 25 universities nationwide have called for their schools to stop investing in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> . 
As part of this larger movement , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> can have an impact . 
Student Council passed a resolution last night requesting the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> to withdraw its investments in <LOCATION>Unocol</LOCATION> if that company does n't address human rights issues and disclose its ties with the military regime . 
Only when these steps are taken can <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> members have a clear conscience if <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> continues to invest in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> . 
Otherwise , the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> will have to shoulder some of the blame for human rights violations in that country . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's best bet is to pull out now . 
Even if <ORGANIZATION>Unocol</ORGANIZATION> claims in the future to be addressing human rights issues , it will be difficult to ever trust a business with such an atrocious track record . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> can invest in a tremendous variety of businesses . 
As a matter of principle , the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> should be ashamed to support corporations that operate in a nation that condones the rape and torture of its citizens . 
Student Council made clear recommendations to the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> : either show the student body that <ORGANIZATION>Unocol</ORGANIZATION> does n't contribute to human rights violations in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> or get rid of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> investments in that corporation . 
The resolution shows that students care about all the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's actions , not just those that hit close to home or effect everyday life in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> . 
It 's time for the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> to show that it cares too , about the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's actions in a world context . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> should never let the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> be tied in any way to horrific human rights violations . 
We encourage the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> to clear the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's name by addressing this matter when it meets next week .
