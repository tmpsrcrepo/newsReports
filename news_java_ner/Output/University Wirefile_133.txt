Turns out that the execution will be televised after all . 
On <DATE>May 16</DATE> , almost 300 survivors and relatives of victims of the <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION> bombing will watch on closed-circuit television as <PERSON>Timothy McVeigh</PERSON> is strapped to a table and given a series of lethal injections . 
It will be the first federal execution since <DATE>1963</DATE> . 
Few can doubt that <PERSON>McVeigh</PERSON> deserves pain and suffering for the 168 people he killed by bombing the <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION> federal building . 
It is ironic , then , that the death penalty gives <PERSON>McVeigh</PERSON> virtually everything he could wish for . 
First , his death will be quick and painless . 
Second , and more importantly , it will make him a martyr for other anti-government extremists and grant credibility to his cause . 
The survivors of the bombings and their families who have chosen to watch the execution want to see McVeigh suffer . 
Their desire for revenge is wholly understandable . 
McVeigh wrought tremendous pain and suffering upon them and upon their loved ones , so they believe that seeing him killed will bring them some sort of satisfaction . 
It is some sort of justice , an eye for an eye . 
McVeigh 's execution may not give viewers the satisfaction they seek , because he will not feel the pain he inflicted on his victims . 
He will be given sodium thiopental , a muscle relaxant , that will protect him from the pain of death , quickly followed by two other injections to induce cardiac arrest . 
It will be quick , it will be painless , and then it will be over , and <PERSON>McVeigh</PERSON> will not pay for any of his crimes anymore . 
Life in prison would be a better punishment . 
Contrary to the rosy picture the media may paint of federal penitentiaries as places where prisoners get free meals and cable , life at a maximum security prison is no day at the beach . 
Prisoners do not have television . 
They do not have video games . 
They are in their cells , alone , for 23 hours of every day . 
For the short time they actually interact with others , they have beatings and rape to fear . 
Confining <PERSON>McVeigh</PERSON> to a cell with nothing but his own thoughts to occupy him until he dies surely would be a better punishment and a better infliction of suffering than a quick and easy death . 
Executing <PERSON>McVeigh</PERSON> is a way of furthering his cause by giving it credibility . 
When you look at why <PERSON>McVeigh</PERSON> bombed the <LOCATION>Oklahoma City</LOCATION> federal building in the first place , <PERSON>McVeigh</PERSON> 's position as the first person in the <DATE>21st century</DATE> to be executed by the federal government is highly ironic . 
The bombing was a protest against what <PERSON>McVeigh</PERSON> calls the " lawlessness " and use of violence by the government . 
This was reflected in his choice of a government building as a target . 
McVeigh first became angry and disillusioned with the government after fighting in the Gulf War and what he saw as the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> ' recourse to violence and aggression in its role there . 
After he came home , two other events further fueled his anger . 
In <DATE>1992</DATE> , a standoff in <LOCATION>Ruby Ridge</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Idaho</LOCATION> between federal agents and white supremacist <PERSON>Randy Weaver</PERSON> resulted in a federal agent killing <PERSON>Weaver</PERSON> 's wife and son . 
McVeigh was upset that the agent did not receive a manslaughter charge . 
McVeigh became even more angry after the <DATE>1993</DATE> siege at <LOCATION>Waco</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> , where 70 Branch Davidians died in a fire after a standoff with federal agents that lasted 51 days . 
He saw the <ORGANIZATION>Ruby Ridge</ORGANIZATION> and Waco incidents as proof that the government was killing people and not being held accountable for it . 
In a <DATE>March 2000</DATE> " 60 Minutes " interview , he said that after hearing about these incidents he decided that citizens need to " keep government in check . " 
When asked if violence is an acceptable option , he said , " If government is the teacher , violence would be an acceptable option . " 
Now , the government is essentially proving him right by killing him . 
Executing <PERSON>McVeigh</PERSON> just makes him a martyr in the eyes of other extremists . 
They will admire him because he " died for his cause . " 
They also may think of <PERSON>McVeigh</PERSON> 's execution as the government killing one of its own citizens , and further proof of the government 's " lawlessness , " lack of accountability , and use of violence that <PERSON>McVeigh</PERSON> was railing against . 
Essentially , the best way to give credibility to <PERSON>McVeigh</PERSON> 's cause in the eyes of all the other extremists out there is to have the government kill him . 
What would be the ultimate punishment for <PERSON>McVeigh</PERSON> ? 
Let him die alone in a jail cell , 50 years from now , unreported , unnoticed , un-glorified . 
Instead of killing him and letting him go out in a blaze of fame , validating his acts in the eyes of other anti-government extremists , let him die with the knowledge that his wasted life was for naught because he did nothing to further his cause .
