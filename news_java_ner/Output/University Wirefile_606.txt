At the start of this semester , all <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> fraternities agreed to a new Fraternal Organization Agreement enhancing safety measures and creating other changes ( though , notably , two fraternities signed " reluctantly " given a threat of suspension ) . 
Following the Rolling Stone fiasco and the conclusion that the gang rape alleged in that article did not occur at <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> , Greek organizations and even my fellow columnist <PERSON>Nate Menninger</PERSON> are suggesting the administration treated fraternities unfairly by suspending them last semester - and by requiring new FOAs now . 
In fact , <ORGANIZATION>Kappa Alpha Order</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Tau Omega</ORGANIZATION> , the two fraternities that initially refused to sign the new FOA , claimed the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> was sacrificing due process and will now possibly pursue legal remedies . 
The claims these groups are making against the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's actions are valid in a general sense of fairness . 
But , in terms of a general conception of rights , fraternities can not necessarily claim due process has been violated . 
The concept of due process in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is rooted in our Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments . 
Since the Fourteenth Amendment expressly requires states to provide due process , and , being public , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> can be considered an arm of the state , our school therefore must apply the Fourteenth Amendment in its proceedings . 
This means , obviously , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> can not arbitrarily expel students . 
But , this does not necessarily mean the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has a duty to apply due process to student organizations . 
While we have seen in the past that corporations can be considered people in certain legal realms , an organization is not the same as a corporation . 
Fraternities sign contracts with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> in the form of FOAs stipulating the rights they may be entitled to , and it is highly unlikely that such contracts provide for the application of due process to the extent it is required for individual students by law . 
While this does not definitively mean the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> does not owe fraternities due process , there is no existing <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> precedent to suggest it does . 
If the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> does owe fraternal organizations due process , this would only apply if <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> deprives fraternities of their right to liberty or property ( as prescribed by the Fourteenth Amendment ) . 
The question , then , would be : did the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> deprive KA and ATO of their liberty and/or did it deprive them of any property by briefly suspending them and requiring new FOAs ? 
It seems unlikely the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> deprived the organizations of their liberty , as it suspended social activities , but it did not expel them or revoke their FOAs ( save for <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> , which voluntarily surrendered its FOA ) , and the new FOA addenda were drafted together with the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> . 
Though sometimes a contract can be considered a property right , an <ORGANIZATION>FOA</ORGANIZATION> establishing the terms of a relationship between a fraternity and the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> would not be considered property . 
If the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> violated the contract it maintained with fraternities , this would not be a question of due process but simply a question of a breach of contract , for which KA and <ORGANIZATION>ATO</ORGANIZATION> can certainly sue , but as a question of contract law , and not one of due process . 
Again , to be clear , this is not to comment on the fairness of the suspension or new FOA agreements - but the legality of the issue is not nearly as straightforward as some fraternities may suggest . 
A court could easily determine the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> owes no due process to fraternities under any circumstances , or a court could find the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> does owe due process , but that it did not violate that duty in this case as the issues of liberty and property do not apply ( probably a more likely result ) . 
While fraternities could , much to their own benefit , achieve a ruling that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> both owes them due process and that these actions have violated that duty , it helps no one to simply throw the term " due process " around as though it is definitively owed . 
Doing so reveals a minimal understanding of that right .
