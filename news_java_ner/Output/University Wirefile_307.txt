When students come to the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> they expect a certain degree of freedom : Academically , socially and ( certainly ) sexually . 
In <DATE>1993</DATE> , when <ORGANIZATION>History Prof.</ORGANIZATION> and director of Studies In Women and Gender <PERSON>Ann Lane</PERSON> wrote a policy to ban student-faculty relationships , it did n't pass , precisely because both the faculty board voting on it and <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students thought it infringed upon their freedom . 
" We were not telling students they could n't have sex , which is what they kept saying we were telling them . 
It is not about sex . 
It is about power , " says Lane . 
The result of this was a compromise on the policy -- student-faculty relationships are not banned , but they 're not encouraged either . 
" It just says to be careful , " she continues . 
Students , however , need to realize that although they may consider sleeping with a professor no different than sleeping with a fellow student , the former can have drastic consequences . 
" Is it really consensual , " Lane points out , " when you 're 18 and the man is 45 ? " 
" Well I figure the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will protect me if anything goes wrong , " says first year <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Traci Kelly</PERSON> . 
If you file charges , this might be true , but the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's stance on sexual harassment is nowhere near as rigid as its position on lying , cheating and stealing . 
Many students figure that they can sleep with their professors ( or other students for that matter ) , and if anything non-consensual occurs , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will be on their side . 
But although <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> follows the single sanction for the honor code , punishment for sexual crimes is decided on a case-by-case basis . 
<PERSON>Matthew Hamilton</PERSON> , for example , was simply " banned from the first year dining hall and from the Aquatic and Fitness Center , " said former <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student and rape victim <PERSON>Annie Hylton</PERSON> in an interview with the Hook . 
Her rapist was not expelled , and he graduated with the rest of his class . 
With professors , the situation is even stickier . 
" Tenured faculty , " says <PERSON>Ann Lane</PERSON> , " they never touch those . 
You 'll never see him again , but they wo n't fire the guy . 
If you need to take a class that particular professor gives , the college will make arrangements . " 
Why then would a student put him or herself at risk and pursue a relationship with a faculty member ? 
" When it 's a teacher , there are women that will find that attractive because it 'll make them feel important , " says <PERSON>Lane</PERSON> , who is currently writing a book on the subject . 
" But it exists the other way around , too . 
And the same-sex relationships also exist although predominantly it is a male professor and a female student . 
A middle aged married man , usually . " 
" I think girls just like being taken care of , " says <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> . 
" We like older men . " 
Regardless of the reason for these relationships , the reality is that most of them have very negative consequences . 
Relationships between faculty and students affect not only the pair but also the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community in general . 
Even in a place as large as this you ca n't guarantee that at some point in your undergraduate or even graduate studies , you wo n't end up taking classes with a certain teacher or that he or she wo n't be in a committee concerning you . 
As in any relationship , there is no guarantee that it will last -- a relationship with a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> professor , however , could potentially affect your career . 
" You ca n't mediate relationships , though , " argues fourth year <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Mark Brewster</PERSON> . 
" They are both adults and as long as the relationship is n't highly characterized by the power differential between the professor and the student ... And how do you judge whether it is or not ? 
People need to make those judgments on their own and with the help of their peers . " 
There is no right or wrong answer to the question of whether or not it is okay to date a professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> ; however , students must take into account the fact that as teachers , these individuals hold a position of more power within the community . 
And even though students may be old enough to date , they are still not full adults . 
In her research for the book , which <PERSON>Lane</PERSON> said she did mostly outside the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , professors would take advantage of that . 
" He [ the professor ] would invite students to his house and give them alcohol and pot , both of which are obviously illegal . 
The students would never report him . " 
Before entering a relationship with a faculty member , then , students should remember that although not all faculty-student relationships end badly -- some , in fact , end in happy marriages -- the possible negative consequences far outweigh the positives .
