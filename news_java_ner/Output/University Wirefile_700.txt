blockquote { float : right ; color : gray ; } Rolling Stone fully retracted its now-infamous article " A Rape on Campus " today following a report by the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Journalism School</ORGANIZATION> which documented a host of journalistic failings behind the story which thrust the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> into the national spotlight last fall.The article , which detailed an alleged gang rape at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity in <DATE>Sept. 2012</DATE> , was removed from the website and replaced by the full version of the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Journalism School</ORGANIZATION> report - which managing editor Will Dana describes as " painful " to read . 
Totaling nearly 13,000 words , the investigatory report sharply criticizes a web of poor decision-making leading to the publication of an article which has since been identified by Poynter as journalism 's " Error of the Year " and by the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Journalism Review</ORGANIZATION> as among <DATE>2014</DATE> 's worst journalism . 
Rolling Stone publisher , <PERSON>Jann Wenner</PERSON> , commissioned an investigation into the magazine 's editing and reporting practices in <DATE>December</DATE> when the article 's accuracy came under heavy scrutiny , following investigations by <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> and other media outlets . 
The final product , authored by <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Journalism School</ORGANIZATION> Dean <PERSON>Steve Coll</PERSON> ; <PERSON>Sheila Coronel</PERSON> , assistant dean of academic affairs ; and <PERSON>Derek Kravitz</PERSON> , the lead researcher on the project , was published <DATE>Sunday</DATE> on both the <ORGANIZATION>Journalism School</ORGANIZATION> 's and <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> 's websites , and will print in this week 's issue of Rolling Stone . 
The report comes two weeks after <LOCATION>Charlottesville Police</LOCATION> suspended its inquiry into the article 's allegations - the result of a months-long investigation unable to confirm the details " to any substantive degree . " 
The article 's author , <PERSON>Sabrina Rubin Erdely</PERSON> , and her editors told the report 's authors afterward that their biggest fault was being too sensitive to the concerns of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> and her requests not to reach out to her alleged attackers or the friends she said spoke with her on the night of her assault . 
" Ultimately , we were too deferential to our rape victim ; we honored too many of her requests in our reporting , " Erdely 's editor <PERSON>Steve Woods</PERSON> is quoted as saying in the report . 
" We should have been much tougher , and in not doing that , we maybe did her a disservice . " 
However , the <ORGANIZATION>CJS</ORGANIZATION> report says this error extended further , alleging Erdely and her editors frequently made concessions and failed to reach out to key sources " even when <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> had made no request that they refrain . " 
Coll , <PERSON>Coronel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kravitz</PERSON> interviewed a host of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> officials and community members for the report , along with several individuals involved in the Rolling Stone editing process , including Erdely . 
They also reviewed more than 400 pages of notes from Erdely documenting her reporting process . 
The report 's authors attempted to reach out to <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> for their investigation , but her lawyer said it was not in her best interest to speak with them . 
Jackie also declined to cooperate with police investigators during their investigation into the article 's claims . 
Contacting <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's friends Throughout her more than three months of reporting , Erdely neglected to contact the three friends <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> says met up with her on the night of her attack - the " most consequential decision " in the reporting process , the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> report 's authors conclude . 
The report documents some of <ORGANIZATION>Erdely</ORGANIZATION> 's efforts to make contact with the friends but determines she failed to adequately pursue their names independent of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's support . 
It also notes that at no time did <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> threaten to stop cooperating if Erdely contacted the friends . 
" That was the reporting path , if taken , that would have almost certainly led the magazine 's editors to change plans , " according to the report . 
All three friends interviewed with the authors of the report and said they would have spoken with Rolling Stone if they had been approached . 
Though <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> told Erdely that she asked third-year Engineering student <PERSON>Ryan Duffin</PERSON> ( " Randall " ) to be interviewed and he refused , <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> investigators that conversation never occurred . 
The three friends - <PERSON>Duffin</PERSON> , third-year College student <PERSON>Kathryn Hendley</PERSON> ( " Cindy " ) and third-year <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Alex Stock</PERSON> ( " Andy " ) - have subsequently spoken to various media outlets , including The Cavalier Daily , and detailed an encounter with <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> which differs substantially from what was reported in Rolling Stone . 
Erdely told the report 's authors that she wished an editor had pushed harder in making her reach out to the three friends , though <PERSON>Woods</PERSON> said he did press multiple times and relented when <PERSON>Erdely</PERSON> said it would not be possible . 
" Of course , just because an editor does not ask a reporter to check derogatory information with a subject , that does not absolve the reporter of the responsibility , " the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> report reads . 
Woods told the report 's authors he opted to use pseudonyms rather than the friends ' actual names to protect them from possible embarrassment . 
A Rolling Stone fact-checker , in reviewing a draft of the report , suggested edits which would have made it more clear that the publication had not contacted <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's three friends , but her suggestions were ultimately overruled . 
The head of the fact-checking department , <PERSON>Coco McPherson</PERSON> , told the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> report authors she read a draft of the article after one of her fact-checkers and said she had confidence in the writers and editors involved . 
The decision to not reach out to the three friends , she said , was made by editors " above my paygrade . " 
Identifying " Drew " Twice during the reporting process , <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> stopped communication with Erdely . 
The second time came in <DATE>October</DATE> , after Erdely began pushing for <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> to identify her attacker , whose full name she had still not revealed to <LOCATION>Erdely</LOCATION> . 
Fearing <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> would back out of the report , <LOCATION>Erdely</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Woods</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Dana</PERSON> agreed to publish the account of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's alleged attack by identifying her primary attacker by a pseudonym - " Drew " - the same workaround they agreed upon for <ORGANIZATION>Jackie</ORGANIZATION> 's three friends . 
Erdely made attempts to identify " Drew " independently , but after she was unable to do so , they agreed to use the pseudonym and pursue the angle no further , the review says . 
Part of this concession came out of a fear of alienating <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> , who said she was still afraid of her attacker and hoped he would not find out about the article . 
According to the report , <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> began cooperating with Erdely immediately after hearing the decision to use the pseudonym . 
The report also states that <PERSON>Dana</PERSON> , who said he takes full responsibility for the article 's failings , was not aware that neither Woods nor Erdely knew the full name of " Drew , " nor of any agreement between Erdely and <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> not to make efforts to identify him . 
Only after the article 's publication did <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> finally offer Erdely his name - at which point she struggled with the spelling , a warning sign for Erdely as she said she herself grew concerned about the accuracy of her report . 
With the name of the alleged attacker in hand , Erdely tried to confirm that the individual worked as a lifeguard or was a member of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> , but was unable to confirm any connection between <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> and her now-named alleged perpetrator . 
Asking for comment The report 's authors say Erdely should have also offered her sources more specific details about the gang rape allegations when asking for comment . 
In examining correspondence with both <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> officials and members of the local and national chapters of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> , the authors conclude Erdely offered only minimal information about the assault , potentially discouraging pre-emptive investigations which could have shed light on the discrepancies in <LOCATION>Jackie</LOCATION> 's account prior to publication . 
Firmly believing <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Stephen Scipione</PERSON> and then-national chapter president <PERSON>Shawn Collingsworth</PERSON> already knew the details of the assault , Erdely merely asked whether they could comment on the allegations , according to her notes . 
" It was complete bullshit , " <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said in the report of his interview with Erdely . 
" They were n't telling me what they were going to write about . 
They were n't telling me any dates or details . " 
University officials were also asked for comment with relatively few specifics . 
Given the restrictions of federal privacy regulations , officials already could not speak to much of the allegations . 
This dynamic - coupled with administrators ' decision not to let Erdely interview with Associate Dean of Students <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> , who handles many of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's Title IX cases - fueled a mistrust between <ORGANIZATION>Erdely</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , the report says . 
Erdely 's confidence in <LOCATION>Jackie</LOCATION> 's account was partly grounded in a lack of explicit denial from either the fraternity or the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , coupled with the fact that it was a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employee , <PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> , who connected Erdely with <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> . 
The report documents the initial conversation between Erdely and <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> , noting that <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> cautioned <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's memory of the event might be flawed . 
Erdely reportedly responded , " it 's totally plausible . " 
Follow-up conversations with <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> suggest the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> was investigating <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> , and <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> also made anonymous reference to <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's assault in testimony before a Congressional subcommittee last <DATE>summer</DATE> - all reinforcing Erdely 's confidence in <LOCATION>Jackie</LOCATION> 's story . 
Jackie carried a confident demeanor throughout the eight interviews she had with Erdely , and she spoke about the alleged assault in great detail . 
In follow-up conversations with the Rolling Stone fact-checker , <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> even offered clarifying and factual corrections to her account - further bolstering the publication 's trust in her narrative . 
But the belief that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and those in the community believed <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's narrative - which was communicated to the fact-checker as well - was misguided , the report concludes . " 
[ The article ] said that <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's friends and student activists at <LOCATION>U.Va</LOCATION> . 
' strongly supported her account , ' " the report reads . 
" That implied that these friends had direct knowledge of the reported rape . 
In fact , the students supported <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> as a survivor , friend and fellow campus reformer . 
They had heard her story , but they could not independently confirm it . " 
Next steps Moving forward , the report says <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> has not yet decided to make any institutional changes in the aftermath of the article . 
Instead , editors insist the failings were an anomaly in a system that generally produces high-quality journalism . 
" It 's not like I think we need to overhaul our process , and I do n't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things , " <PERSON>Dana</PERSON> said in the report . 
" We just have to do what we 've always done and just make sure we do n't make this mistake again . " 
In a letter introducing the report on Rolling Stone 's website , <PERSON>Dana</PERSON> said the publication is committed to developing solutions to the shortcomings identified in the report . 
" We are also committing ourselves to a series of recommendations about journalistic practices that are spelled out in the report , " <PERSON>Dana</PERSON> said . 
" We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout , including members of the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity and <ORGANIZATION>UVA</ORGANIZATION> administrators and students . 
Sexual assault is a serious problem on college campuses , and it is important that rape victims feel comfortable stepping forward . 
It saddens us to think that their willingness to do so might be diminished by our failings . " 
Coll and <PERSON>Coronel</PERSON> will speak at a press conference <DATE>Monday</DATE> at noon to discuss the report and answer questions . 
The event will be live broadcast at bit.ly / cjslive .
