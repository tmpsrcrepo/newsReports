This article was updated to include a press release from the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> was officially reinstated by both the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and the national <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity organization , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> announced in a press release <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> . 
" The reinstatement resulted after consultation with <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Department</ORGANIZATION> officials , who told <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> that their investigation has not revealed any substantive basis to confirm that the allegations raised in the Rolling Stone article occurred at <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> , " according to the release . 
Charlottesville Police Captain <PERSON>Gary Pleasants</PERSON> said the investigation into the incident is still ongoing , but that no evidence indicates <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> should continue to be under sanction . 
" We are looking at the allegations in their totality , " he said , adding that investigators have not yet made a determination about the accuracy of the incident as a whole . 
He said police hope to conclude their investigation in a couple of weeks , and they will not disclose more specifics about their investigation until that time . 
The chapter voluntarily suspended its activities in <DATE>November</DATE> , after allegations in a Rolling Stone article that the fraternity was involved in a gang rape of a first-year student in <DATE>September 2012</DATE> . 
After the article 's publication , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> requested <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police</ORGANIZATION> investigate the alleged attack . 
The accuracy of the article has subsequently been called into question and friends of the first-year student , <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> , have noted several discrepancies between what they remember of the assault and how it was portrayed in Rolling Stone . 
" Their investigation has not revealed any substantive basis to confirm that the allegations raised in the Rolling Stone article occurred at <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Brian Ellis</PERSON> , spokesperson for the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> , said the national chapter did not have direct contact with police , but heard about the findings after <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> met with investigators last week . 
Additionally , he said members of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter met with investigators and provided them information they obtained during an internal investigation - the findings of which were released last month . 
National members offered guidance during the internal investigation , which found that no member of the fraternity was employed at the AFC at the time and that there was no party at the house on the <TIME>night</TIME> documented in the Rolling Stone article , but the majority of the investigation was handled by <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter members . 
In a letter dated <DATE>Jan. 6</DATE> sent to <PERSON>Stephen Scipione</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter and a third-year College student , <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON>Shawn Collinsworth</PERSON> said the national organization was removing the fraternity 's temporary suspension and reinstating the organization back to " good status " in accordance with the body 's governing documents . 
" Also , I would like to take a moment and commend the chapter , and specifically the chapter leadership , for their full cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION>Headquarters Staff</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Executive Council</ORGANIZATION> and local law enforcement over the past several months , " <PERSON>Collingsworth</PERSON> said . 
" It is a true testament of the quality of member that <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Alpha currently has in the chapter . " 
The fraternity became the first to sign on to a new Fraternal Organization Agreement <DATE>Jan. 8</DATE> , which includes new regulations about how <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> fraternities will conduct parties by mandating sober brothers at each fraternity function , along with requiring guest lists and restricting the type of alcohol that can be served . 
In a press release from the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Alpha Chapter , <PERSON>Scipione</PERSON> said the chapter was relieved police cleared the organization of involvement in the incident . 
" In today 's 24-hour news cycle , we all have a tendency to rush to judgment without having all of the facts in front of us , " he said . 
" As a result , our fraternity was vandalized , our members ostracized based on false information . " 
He added that the local chapter will participate in the University-wide effort to improve student safety . 
" This has prompted us to take a closer look at ourselves and what role organizations like ours may play in this problem , " he said . 
" It 's opened all of our eyes to the problem of sexual assault . 
Now it 's time to do something about it . "
