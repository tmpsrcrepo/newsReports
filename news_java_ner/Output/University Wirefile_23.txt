Pity poor <PERSON>Joe Q. Public</PERSON> . 
No matter how hard he tries , he ca n't have an effective voice in government . 
The representatives <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> elects ca n't make the laws that he wants -- laws that draw a line in the sand and say what <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> and his neighbors will and wo n't accept . 
And who does <PERSON>Joe Q. Public</PERSON> have to thank for the obstruction of the democratic process ? 
Judicial activists who extend substantive rights to extremes they never should reach , and at a high societal cost to boot . 
Last week the American people were treated to a healthy dose of judicial paternalism in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> . 
A federal district court judge used his " gavel veto " to wipe away the voice of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and the American people in overturning the Child Pornography Protection Act of <DATE>1996</DATE> . 
The act amended the definition of illegal child pornography to include computer-generated or altered images that look like minors engaged in sexual acts . 
First Amendment absolutists will argue that the only reason pornography involving children is illegal is that the production of such material harms the children involved . 
But the secondary effects of child pornography merit prevention as well . 
Child pornography , like any other form of pornography , is designed with the intention of arousing its audience . 
Sex among adults generally is accepted by society , so arousal through certain portrayals of adults is acceptable . 
But the statutory rape laws of the states clearly indicate that society does not accept sex with children . 
That society does not need to accept a portrayal of those acts if it has made clear its aversion to such images . 
Even if the pornographic material does not exploit children in its creation , mere computer alteration does not make it any more tolerable . 
It inspires deviant behavior that the government has a legitimate interest in combating . 
This is not to say that free speech claims are less important . 
The Child Pornography Protection Act of <DATE>1996</DATE> is vastly different from the Communications Decency Act of <DATE>1995</DATE> , struck down by <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1997</DATE> case <ORGANIZATION>Reno v. ACLU</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>CDA</ORGANIZATION> criminalized the transmission of pornographic materials over the Internet to anyone who was under 18 . 
The Court found that the <ORGANIZATION>CDA</ORGANIZATION> had a " chilling effect " on free speech , because people would hesitate to transmit information out of fear that a recipient might be a minor . 
The Court also found that less restrictive means were available to achieve the same goal , such as age verification sites and parental control . 
The <ORGANIZATION>CDA</ORGANIZATION> was too restrictive because it restricted adult pornography , which society has determined permissible for adult viewing . 
In contrast , the CPPA was designed to protect children from being exploited by pornography . 
It makes no difference whether or not children are used in the actual filming of the material . 
Even if a producer uses animated children , or a short , skinny 19-year-old actress to portray a 12-year-old girl , the secondary effects of the pornography are to sexually arouse a viewer and inspire conduct that the states already have made illegal . 
Child pornography does not only exploit the children pictured , it exploits all children . 
Presumably , <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON>Gene Carter</PERSON> 's primary objection to the <ORGANIZATION>CPPA</ORGANIZATION> is that the law is overly broad , and would ban even sexual depictions protected by <DATE>1973</DATE> 's <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> v. <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> standard of material with " serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value " . 
I have n't the foggiest clue under what circumstances a picture of two children or a child and an adult having sex could have serious artistic , political or scientific value . 
( Literary value is irrelevant to the CPPA , because the law only applies to images ) . 
Benign pictures with social value would still be permissible under the CPPA : A naked child appearing in a non-sexual manner in a medical textbook would not fall under the law 's reach . 
The Child Pornography Protection Act was adopted to combat the use of computers to alter pictures of children , making it appear as though the children were engaged in explicit sex acts . 
The public has spoken and determined that pornographic portrayals of children will not be tolerated . 
The people are free to reverse that determination if one day society says child pornography is acceptable . 
There is no constitutional prohibition on child pornography , no restriction that would prevent someone from one day convincing a majority of the voting public that child pornography was beneficial to society . 
But until that day , no judge should be allowed to hide behind the <ORGANIZATION>First Amendment</ORGANIZATION> and countermand the will of the people . 
The only purpose of pictures of children engaging in sex acts is to inspire sexual deviants to pursue unlawful conduct . 
If that 's what <PERSON>James Madison</PERSON> sought to protect , I 'll eat my Constitution .
