Garbage was once the perfect band . 
Not in the sense that its music projected a superior aura or that its first two albums were impeccable . 
No , the very composition of the band generated its perfection . 
On Garbage 's eponymous debut , <PERSON>Shirley Manson</PERSON> took the microphone with a nihilistic snarl , singing with empowerment and sexual braggadocio as seduction dripped from her every word . 
But she did n't want you -- she wanted to break you down . 
Aged but stylishly hip journeymen , <PERSON>Manson</PERSON> 's other bandmates -- especially producer and drummer <PERSON>Butch Vig</PERSON> -- blended into the background as they created a ceaselessly constructed wall of sound from playfully ragged guitar riffs , driving drum loops and gaudy hooks . 
They drowned listeners in a sea of meticulously arranged gothic power pop but hid behind the raw face of <PERSON>Manson</PERSON> . 
" Do n't look behind the curtain ! " 
they declared in silence , " Keep your eyes on the supervixen . " 
Garbage greatness thus derived from its ability to deceive . 
You were meant to believe the band relied only on the charisma of <PERSON>Manson</PERSON> , but in reality it equally drew from <PERSON>Vig</PERSON> 's ability to create pop music veiled in gothic grunge and pulsing electronica . 
It was a two-headed monster that tried to play itself off as merely a pit bull . 
The result took pressure off <PERSON>Vig</PERSON> and allowed him to create compositions on Garbage 's follow-up " Version 2.0 " that subtly combined new wave and more jagged guitars with its usual ear candy . 
Meanwhile , all attention was focused on <PERSON>Manson</PERSON> , who grew fiercer and more fearless in her intensity . 
But what happens when the curtain is pulled down ? 
The answer lies on Garbage 's latest endeavor , " Beautifulgarbage , " an album that puts <PERSON>Vig</PERSON> and company on center stage because of a mostly tepid , frustrated <PERSON>Manson</PERSON> . 
Typically the energetic masthead of the group , <PERSON>Manson</PERSON> is burdened with a schizophrenic state of mind that shifts between calmness , anger , loneliness and even brokenness . 
On " Silence is Golden , " <PERSON>Manson</PERSON> questions an incident of sexual abuse but struggles to find a response , finally ending not in resolution but in deeper confusion . 
" My body 's a temple/But nothing is simple/Silence is golden/I have been broken/Something was stolen , " she sings as the band echoes her frustration by alternating between a tense , throbbing accompaniment and abrasive guitar explosions . 
<PERSON>Manson</PERSON> 's subdued presence calls for <PERSON>Vig</PERSON> to elevate his , meeting her timidity with musical vigor and ambitious arrangements . 
His response defines the album . 
Instead of honing the art of grunge pop that first defined the band , <PERSON>Vig</PERSON> goes the opposite direction and delves into a scattered range of musical styles that create an overly eclectic , unbalanced album . 
The album 's opener " Shut Your Mouth , " a whining tirade against critics accompanied by a similarly asinine '80s distorted guitar , christens the album bitterly . 
The following R&B - influenced " Androgyny " vainly recycles the stale theme of sexual confusion that was shocking a mere 15 years ago when the Replacements first addressed it . 
On " Ca n't Cry These , " <PERSON>Vig</PERSON> drenches <PERSON>Manson</PERSON> 's tale of woe with romantic <DATE>1950s</DATE> girl-group harmonies . 
Already within the first three songs , <PERSON>Vig</PERSON> strives for grandiose production but falters through his inconsistency and inability to enhance the songs ' themes . 
Not until " Cup of Coffee , " a wrenchingly personal ballad with haunting trip-hop production and synthy strings , does " Beautifulgarbage " take off . 
" And no of course we ca n't be friends/Not while I 'm still this obsessed/I want to ask where I went wrong/But do n't say anything at all , " <PERSON>Manson</PERSON> sings with resignation . 
Amongst the rubble of failed bombastic musical experimentation , Garbage creates its most potent tracks ( " Nobody Loves You , " " So Like a Rose " ) when it stresses a pristine simplicity . 
" Cherry Lips ( Go Baby Go ! ) " 
successfully returns to the new wave influenced power pop that highlighted " Version 2.0 , " but the song 's campy bell chimes and <PERSON>Manson</PERSON> 's artificially sweet voice are disappointingly toothless . 
The spark has been temporarily removed from Garbage . 
Without the dominating dynamism of <LOCATION>Manson</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Vig</PERSON> has overcompensated by attempting to give the band forced new sounds . 
Unfortunately , on " Beautifulgarbage " <PERSON>Vig</PERSON> can be heard desperately scattering to find them . 
Do not doubt that <PERSON>Vig</PERSON> will rediscover his niche and <PERSON>Manson</PERSON> will fall back into her fiery persona -- because when they do they 'll regain their lost perfection .
