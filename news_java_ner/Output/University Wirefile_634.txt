Shutian Yang | The Cavalier Daily Representatives discuss how to better incorporate student opinions . 
<PERSON>Archie Holmes</PERSON> , vice provost for educational innovation and interdisciplinary studies , spoke to Student Council <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> about the <DATE>2015</DATE> Student Experience in the <ORGANIZATION>Research University</ORGANIZATION> survey . 
<PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said the purpose of the survey is to look at how the undergraduate experience is for students . 
" There 's lots of interest in the educational experience of students , " he said . 
" What we 're really interested [ in ] is what is driving these numbers . " 
<PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>SERU</ORGANIZATION> survey has two primary components - a core section which every student takes and a series of modules into which students are randomly assigned . 
" Having a lot of response helps the departments understand what it means to be a student here , " <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said . 
From the survey , fourth-year students reported improvement throughout their academic career in expected ways , including improvement in areas such as leadership skills and analytical and critical thinking . 
However , <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said other areas , such as foreign language , did not show as much positive development . 
The survey provided an opportunity for the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> to compare the findings to those at similar universities , including the <ORGANIZATION>University of North Carolina</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Chapel Hill</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>the University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> . 
Students at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , in comparison to those at other institutions , have reported spending less time attending class or discussion , and first and second-years have reported a lower likelihood of being accepted into a desired major program . 
In response , <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said departments are beginning to address the issues in a variety of ways . " 
[ The departments have ] improved communication , increased academic rigor and added instruction and advising for that major about life after U.Va , " he said . 
<PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said an advising survey conducted in <DATE>2014</DATE> showed improvable rates of advisor satisfaction . 
While advisors seem to be an appropriate match for students , he said , many students think they need more time to meet with advisors . 
He said the survey showed stronger student-advisor relationships from students who had taken a <ORGANIZATION>College Advising Seminar</ORGANIZATION> . 
" The College has expanded its COLA program to approximately 60 this past <DATE>fall</DATE> , " <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> said . 
" How do we take this and translate it into engineering ? " 
Holmes also detailed upcoming initiatives to improve student experience , including the recent <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> Leadership Program , connecting academic work with community based service and the <ORGANIZATION>Undergraduate Student Opportunities in Academic Research Program</ORGANIZATION> . 
In order to better translate survey data into an improved undergraduate experience , <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> expressed his desire to increase student responses to the survey . 
Twenty four percent of the student body responded to the <DATE>2014</DATE> survey while <PERCENT>16 percent</PERCENT> have responded to the <DATE>2015</DATE> survey as of now . 
At <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> 's meeting Council President and fourth-year Engineering student <PERSON>Jalen Ross</PERSON> also gave updates regarding campus sexual assault policy advancements in the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said the legislation - which includes a bill requiring colleges to mark academic transcripts if a student is found guilty of sexual assault and another with mandatory reporting requirements - was largely reactive to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's last semester . 
The mandatory reporting legislation originally required <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> faculty members to report information on sexual assault to law enforcement . 
But <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> and other students , who were concerned with police involvement , attended the committee session and managed to negotiate to slightly alter the proposals . " 
[ We ] got it rationed down to a more reasonable compromise , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said . 
Instead , reports will go to a Title IX coordinator for review by a threat assessment team . 
" We 're working on getting ODOS carved out [ of the threat assessment team ] so at least there 's someone in Office of the Dean of Students that you can go to in confidentiality , " he said . 
Ross invited <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> members to accompany him on future trips to <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> because he said student voices can make a difference . 
" The most impactful thing you can do is show up and show that students are interested , " <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> said .
