Students hope to soon officially launch a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter of Help Save the <ORGANIZATION>Next Girl</ORGANIZATION> , a national organization founded by <PERSON>Gil</PERSON> and <PERSON>Dan Harrington</PERSON> to raise awareness for missing persons and violence against women . 
They founded the organization in memory of their daughter , <PERSON>Morgan Harrington</PERSON> , a <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Tech student who was abducted and killed in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> in <DATE>2009</DATE> . 
Third-year Continuing and Professional Studies student <PERSON>Landon Wilkins</PERSON> and second-year Nursing student <PERSON>Heather Kesler</PERSON> spearheaded the effort for HSTNG in light of the recent disappearance of second-year College student <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> . 
<PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> said the interest was also sparked by other recent missing persons cases in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> and surrounding areas , including women who were never reported as missing . 
" There was a girl missing the same day as <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> , " <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> said . 
" There are also the issues from <DATE>2012</DATE> of Dashad ' Sage ' <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> , a transgender African American woman who went missing from the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Amtrak station . " 
<PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kesler</PERSON> are working to gain CIO status for HSTNG at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Student Council must vote on the chapter 's approval . 
Wilkins and <PERSON>Kesler</PERSON> have already created plans to carry out the goals of the organization . 
" We 'll have a few fundraising events and raise awareness for missing persons cases - just events to keep their names and faces out there , " <PERSON>Kesler</PERSON> said . 
" We 'll also have educational programs to help women protect themselves and let men know what they can do to help make the community a safer place . " 
<PERSON>Ian Heflin</PERSON> , a director for the national organization , said these events differ between various chapters , and <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> 's chapter might well be different than the original chapter at <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We hold community events to raise awareness , and participate with law enforcement to promote their ' Rape , Aggression , <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> ' courses , " <PERSON>Heflin</PERSON> said . 
" We hope that through education we can reduce the number of people who are passive bystanders and help save lives . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> 's chapter of the organization sponsors Take Back the <TIME>Night</TIME> , in addition to seminars at local schools in coordination with the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> police force . 
Chapter President <PERSON>Erica Grant</PERSON> , a junior at <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> , said these events are necessary to fulfill the vision of the organization . 
" Every year , we chalk the bridge where <PERSON>Morgan Harrington</PERSON> was last seen with quotes and drawings of girls who are not forgotten , " <PERSON>Grant</PERSON> said . 
" People 's lives are at stake when you do nothing . 
Action is imperative . " 
The organization has spread across high school and college campuses nationwide . 
Grant said there is stronger defense against abduction when multiple schools in an area develop their own chapters and means of awareness . 
" It is especially important that U.Va . 
open a chapter with the recent abduction of <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> , " <PERSON>Grant</PERSON> said . 
" This is the time to take action . 
Do n't just sit around and wait for this to happen again . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter sent its application to <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Sunday</DATE> . 
Until the chapter receives <ORGANIZATION>CIO</ORGANIZATION> approval , <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> said students can become involved through other means . 
" Students can help by donating to the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> police department things like food , water and emotional encouragement , " <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> said . " 
They can also help by joining other sexual assault groups on grounds , like One in Four . " 
Students must be proactive to help the cause , <PERSON>Grant</PERSON> said . 
" Personal safety is of the utmost importance , but there is a flipside to all of this , " she said . 
" Everyone should be protective of the people around them . 
You should always be aware of your surroundings . "
