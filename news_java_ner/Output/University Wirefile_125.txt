According to a recent <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> report , almost <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> of college women will experience rape or attempted rape each academic year . 
The researchers interviewed 4,446 women attending two - or four-year colleges . 
In the survey , <PERCENT>2.8 percent</PERCENT> of women reported they had been raped or had escaped an attempted rape . 
The report claims that 27.7 rapes occur per 1,000 female students in an academic year . 
The statistic for the entire year , including reports made in the <DATE>summer</DATE> and during vacation times , jumps to <PERCENT>4.9 percent</PERCENT> . 
The <PERCENT>4.9 percent</PERCENT> incident rate of rapes may also be a misleadingly low statistic because the " reported number [ of rapes ] vastly understates the actual number , " Asst. Dean of Students <PERSON>John Foubert</PERSON> said . 
Many rapes go unreported each year because the victim may feel embarrassment , fear that she will be blamed , misunderstand rape terminology or be reluctant to identify her attackers , the report said . 
Research shows nearly <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of rapes occurred in the victim 's residence , <PERCENT>31 percent</PERCENT> in other campus living quarters and <PERCENT>10.3 percent</PERCENT> took place in a fraternity house . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> tries to combat incidents of sexual assaults by preventative education , <PERSON>Foubert</PERSON> said . 
Programs include sexual assault discussions for all incoming first years during orientation and programs in residence halls , sororities and fraternities . 
Student education groups such as One in Four and the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Education Office</ORGANIZATION> lead these efforts . 
One in Four , an all-male peer education group with 31 student participants , targets its education exclusively at men . 
One in Four defines rape , discusses survivor empathy and advises men how to help a rape survivor regain control over her life , fourth-year College student and member <PERSON>Dan Carlile</PERSON> said .
