In a lawsuit filed <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> 's circuit court , fourth-year <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Luis Avila</PERSON> is seeking damages from fourth-year student <PERSON>Joshua Weatherbee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Weatherbee</PERSON> 's fraternity , <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Delta Phi of Virginia , Inc.</ORGANIZATION> , for charges that include alleged assault and battery and racial and ethnic harassment and violence . 
The suit also claims the fraternity is guilty of gross negligence and negligence in preventing the alleged attack on Avila . 
On <DATE>Dec. 12 , 2003</DATE> , <PERSON>Weatherbee</PERSON> pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of assault and battery against <PERSON>Avila</PERSON> . 
He was sentenced to 12 months jail time , with 11 months suspended . 
Weatherbee could not be reached for comment . 
The current civil claim for compensation and the criminal charges both refer to an incident that occurred between the night of <DATE>Sept. 19</DATE> and early morning <DATE>Sept. 20 , 2003</DATE> at a party held at the <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Delta Phi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity house . 
According to the <DATE>March 17</DATE> motion for judgment , which details the charges against <PERSON>Weatherbee</PERSON> and the fraternity , <PERSON>Avila</PERSON> arrived at the party as a guest of an <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Delta Phi</ORGANIZATION> member . 
" At a certain point , without provocation , Mr. <PERSON>Weatherbee</PERSON> physically attacked Mr. <PERSON>Avila</PERSON> , striking him with his fists in the face and body , throwing him to the floor , falling on him and striking him repeatedly , " the document states . 
The suit alleges that <PERSON>Weatherbee</PERSON> shouted threats and phrases during the assault that were " motivated by animosity toward Mr. <PERSON>Avila</PERSON> because of Mr. <PERSON>Avila</PERSON> 's racial and/or ethnic background . " 
These are said to include , " You should go back to <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> " and " You should be washing my dishes . " 
According to <PERSON>Avila</PERSON> 's lawyer , <LOCATION>Edward Wayland</LOCATION> , these statements add another component to the incident -- a component that allows <PERSON>Avila</PERSON> to seek compensation as an alleged victim of violence , harassment or intimidation which is motivated by racial and ethnic animosity . 
Avila seeks a total of <MONEY>$ 300,000</MONEY> in compensatory and punitive damages from <PERSON>Weatherbee</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Delta Phi of Virginia , Inc</ORGANIZATION> . 
He was advised by <LOCATION>Wayland</LOCATION> not to talk about the suit and could not be reached for comment . 
<PERSON>David Brewster</PERSON> , international president of <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Delta Phi</ORGANIZATION> , said the organization will have legal representation under an umbrella liability policy for the charges filed against <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Delta Phi of Virginia , Inc</ORGANIZATION> . 
Although <PERSON>Brewster</PERSON> has not yet seen the filed papers , he said the fraternity will ask to be released from the suit . 
" We do n't see how it has to do with the fraternity at all , " he said . 
" It may have happened on fraternity property , but it could easily have happened anywhere else . " 
However , according to <LOCATION>Wayland</LOCATION> , an organization is responsible for the actions of people who are its agents . 
" We believe the fraternity had an obligation to its guests to protect them from people liable to become violent and harmful , and it did n't do that , " <LOCATION>Wayland</LOCATION> said . 
Although still active , the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> chapter of <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Delta Phi</ORGANIZATION> lost its recognition with the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> this semester for reasons unrelated to the lawsuit . 
Chapter president <PERSON>Christopher Moore</PERSON> also had yet to read the filed suit but said the fraternity is committed to standing behind <PERSON>Weatherbee</PERSON> . 
While <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said <PERSON>Avila</PERSON> " was certainly justified in filing the [ criminal ] charges that he did , " he also said he believes <PERSON>Weatherbee</PERSON> has already paid for his inappropriate actions , noting that <PERSON>Weatherbee</PERSON> spent Christmas in jail . 
In reference to the claim for racial or ethnic harassment and violence , <PERSON>Brewster</PERSON> and <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> both said they were distressed by possible harm to the fraternity 's reputation . 
" We 're open to everybody , " <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said . 
" We have brothers from all races , religions and nationalities . 
I hope this incident does n't give the impression that we 're a racist house because I 'd have to say , we 're one of the most diverse houses out there . " 
Similarly , <PERSON>Brewster</PERSON> said any characterization of the house as racist " burns [ him ] up . " 
" The way we look at it is , society has a problem , not us , " he said .
