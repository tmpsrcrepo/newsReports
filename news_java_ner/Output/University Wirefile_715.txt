The event also allowed for members of the audience to ask questions to the panel , an aspect many of the event organizers noted as one of the highlights of the evening .

[ The event was ] very successful , I 'm pleased with the turnout and the diverse group of panelists , " <PERSON>Roderick</PERSON> said . 
" All of their stories impacted the audience who were very engaged . " 
The events hosted by Take Back the <TIME>Night</TIME> are much anticipated in the aftermath of the retracted Rolling Stone article , which sparked debate at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and national level regarding sexual assault on college campuses . 
The organizers of the event said despite the new atmosphere surrounding the issue , the events will continue as they have in the past . 
<PERSON>Erica Robertson</PERSON> , major event chair for the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition</ORGANIZATION> and fourth-year College student , said she recognized the differences to consider for this year 's events . 
" It 's something we have acknowledged and [ have ] noted the potential changes from the past , " <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> said . 
" We are taking as many precautions as we can to create a safe space . " 
One particular change which has come from the policies created in the aftermath of Rolling Stone is the new <ORGANIZATION>Fraternity Organization Agreement</ORGANIZATION> certificate , which certifies events such as the ones being held this week as educational opportunities for the Greek community . 
<PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> noted the benefits of this new policy , but emphasized the events should be frequented by every member of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . " 
[ These events ] provide them an ample opportunity to know about the issues , " <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> said . 
" Its not limited to the Greek community , but highlighted there . 
Its an issue affecting everyone in the real world . " 
An event on policy will be held <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> which will cover the new changes to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policy on sexual assault .
