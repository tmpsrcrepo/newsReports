The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily A Virginia House</ORGANIZATION> of Delegates bill filed <DATE>Jan. 8</DATE> is moving to expand criminal DNA data banks in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . 
If passed , the bill - submitted by <ORGANIZATION>Virginia House</ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON>David Toscano</PERSON> , D-Charlottesville , after an effort by <ORGANIZATION>Albemarle County Sheriff Chip Harding</ORGANIZATION> - would legally require those convicted of any additional 99 Class 1 misdemeanors to submit a DNA sample to the state data bank . 
The bill would expand Class 1 misdemeanors to encompass convictions such as trespassing , assault and battery and driving under the influence . 
Most traffic offenses and misdemeanors committed by juveniles would be exempt from the DNA requirement . 
Harding said that when he first floated this idea <DATE>last year</DATE> , it did not gain much attention , and that the disappearance of second-year College student <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> gave his initiative greater impetus . " 
[ This new requirement ] is something that I 've been interested in seeing happen for quite a few years , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
" I think the inspiration and what 's finally getting it some traction now is the story of <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> . " 
Under the proposed bill , <PERSON>Jesse Matthew</PERSON> - now charged with abduction of <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> with intent to defile - would have been required to submit a DNA sample to the state data bank in <DATE>2010</DATE> following a trespassing conviction . 
Other states , such as <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> , have expanded the number of crimes that require DNA sample submissions in recent years . 
A <DATE>2006</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>New York State Assembly</ORGANIZATION> decision to require DNA samples from those convicted of petty larceny and other minor crimes has helped turn up forensic evidence in a number of homicides and sexual assault cases . 
<LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Andrew Cuomo</PERSON> again expanded the data bank in <DATE>2012</DATE> . 
Harding said <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 's policy sets a solid example for implementation in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . 
" The biggest impact is most rapists are serial offenders , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
" <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> is not [ currently ] taking their DNA . " 
In <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> , a first-time felon has committed an average of three previous misdemeanors , <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
When rapes are classified as misdemeanors instead of felonies , the criminal 's DNA is not entered into the system , compounding the present problem . 
DNA samples currently cost about <MONEY>$ 50</MONEY> to collect , process and enter into the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> state data system , <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
Based on arrest data from state police , <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said if the bill were adopted , it would result in an estimated 40,000 DNA samples to be collected next year . 
Currently , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> collects around 22,000 samples primarily from convicted felons . 
Harding said the proposed bill may be met with some opposition within the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> due to widespread skepticism about increasing the government 's presence in law enforcement . 
He said , however , that there is already legislation in place to safeguard information in the data bank . 
" Research shows it 'll save lives , " <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> said . 
The bill is expected to appear <DATE>Jan. 28</DATE> in the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia House Court of Justice Committee</ORGANIZATION> .
