Cavalier Daily <PERSON>Atthar Mirza</PERSON> and <PERSON>Elizabeth Ballou</PERSON> - second and third-year College students , respectively - released a self-made video <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> thanking <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> for telling her story and offering support for sexual assault survivors in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
Jackie , a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student , told Rolling Stone magazine seven men - one of whom she worked with as a lifeguard at the Aquatic and <ORGANIZATION>Fitness Center</ORGANIZATION> - raped her at a <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity party on <DATE>September 28 , 2012</DATE> . 
The fraternity has since disputed <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's story , claiming there was no party on that particular date and that no <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> brother worked at the Aquatic and <ORGANIZATION>Fitness Center</ORGANIZATION> at that time . 
The conflicting accounts have stirred controversy on Grounds and in the national media . 
" I felt people were fixating on the details and quality of Rolling Stone reporting , and the fact is , whatever happened , something happened to <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> , " <PERSON>Mirza</PERSON> said . 
" And even if she made up the story , things like this do happen , and there are sexual assaults that do n't get reported , so I meant to bring the focus back to <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> . 
Whatever comes of this , we 're still behind her and we still think she did something brave by coming forward . " 
Mirza produced the video himself using <ORGANIZATION>Adobe</ORGANIZATION> After Effects software . 
Ballou edited the script and provided the voice-over for the short piece . 
The pair met after receiving prizes for a contest held last month commemorating the fall of the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> Wall . 
" We were eating brunch at <ORGANIZATION>Pigeon Hole</ORGANIZATION> , talking about projects we were both working on , and Rolling Stone came up because I was very angry about the Rolling Stone retraction , " <PERSON>Ballou</PERSON> said . 
" He said he was doing a video and asked if I wanted to look at the text and do the voice over . 
We met up in the media lab and I looked over the text and changed some things , and went into the recording booth and voiced . " 
The video opens with a statement of thanks and a message of hope for survivors . 
" Thank you for pulling back the curtain , for taking rape from an open secret to a public issue , " it says . 
" Thanks for your bravery . " 
Ballou recently authored an article for Bustle.com about the frustration many <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students have felt following <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's account and <ORGANIZATION>Rolling Stone</ORGANIZATION> 's subsequent apology for its " misplaced " trust in <LOCATION>Jackie</LOCATION> . 
Rolling Stone has since revised its original apology and removed the sentence containing the phrase " our trust in her was misplaced . " 
As a survivor of sexual assault herself , <PERSON>Ballou</PERSON> said , the issue of rape and sexual assault at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> is personal . 
" I read many peoples ' responses to the Rolling Stone article , many of which were saying something like , ' I too have been a victim and I kept quiet about it , ' " <PERSON>Ballou</PERSON> said . 
" I really identified with those , because I was sexually assaulted my first year and I did n't go to the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> . 
I did n't think it was serious enough . 
And now I regret not trying to address it in some way . " 
Mirza said he hopes the video will provide support for <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> and propel the conversation around sexual assault prevention forward in coming months . 
" The biggest danger of this discussion around sexual assault is that it will fade , " he said . 
" We ca n't let that happen . 
So to keep this discussion going I wanted to contribute something that will stick in people 's brains for a bit longer . "
