Every college and university is unique in dealing with lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender issues . 
Unlike <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , schools similar in size and reputation , such as the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>the University of Maryland</ORGANIZATION> , provide formal resources to lgbt students . 
In response to this fact , an ad-hoc group of representatives from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's lgbt communities appealed to the administration <DATE>Sept. 16</DATE> , asking for adequate resources , heightened visibility and acceptance of the lgbt communities . 
" What it comes down to , is that there 's nothing here , " committee member <PERSON>Jim Steichen</PERSON> said . 
" There is nothing specifically geared toward us . 
There is no administrative official whose job title explicitly or specifically deals with or includes us . " 
" Researching other universities and what they have is the best way to go , " said <PERSON>Heather Leitzke</PERSON> , chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Student Council 's LGBT Affairs Committee</ORGANIZATION> . 
Leitzke said the ad-hoc group , which formed during the <DATE>summer</DATE> , sent letters to other institutions with established lgbt resources . 
Committee members sought support for group 's cause using evidence from other universities . 
Although newly appointed <ORGANIZATION>Assoc. Dean of Students Glenna Chang</ORGANIZATION> has publicly supported the lgbt communities , she does so in an informal capacity . 
<PERSON>Steichen</PERSON> stressed the importance of administrative support in changing the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's attitude toward lgbt students . 
" Institutionalized messages in the form of officials who speak out on these issues sends the message that compassionate , accepting behavior is something that 's expected at U.Va. , " he said . 
A proposal presented to the Office of the Dean of Students last month called for , among other resources , the establishment of an official administrative position to represent lgbt students . 
But concerns about the feasibility of obtaining a dean caused committee members to modify the proposal by not asking for a formal deanship . 
" A more realistic step is just to create a paid position at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> along the lines of <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> at the Women 's Center , " <PERSON>Leitzke</PERSON> said . 
Kaplan organizes programs for sexual assault victims and maintains a help network . 
Committee members point to resources available at peer schools to strengthen their case . 
At <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> , resources include a student resource center , a full-time coordinator for Lgbt issues and a newly formed presidential commission on lgbt awareness . 
In <DATE>1971</DATE> , <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> officials established a deanship and the nation 's first <ORGANIZATION>Office of LGBT Affairs</ORGANIZATION> . 
At <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> , while no formal deanship exists , a group of faculty and administrators aid student activists in creating a comfortable environment for " out " students , said <PERSON>Allen DeLong</PERSON> , who advises the school 's Lesbian , Gay , <ORGANIZATION>Bisexual Association</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I can not stress the importance of having ' out ' faculty and staff and having allies for students , " <PERSON>DeLong</PERSON> said . 
" Students ... need someone to prove to them it 's okay to be ' out . ' " 
Despite these peer institutions ' formalized programs , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administrators said they think the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is handling lgbt concerns appropriately now . 
" All deans can handle matters related to " lgbt students , Dean of Students <PERSON>Robert T. Canevari</PERSON> said . 
" I think that 's a strength instead of a weakness . "
