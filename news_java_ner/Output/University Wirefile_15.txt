CHILD molestation possibly is the most difficult issue to debate in modern society . 
Some individuals passionately support measures to afford our children the highest protection from former child molesters . 
Others fervently contend we must not ignore the rights of anyone in society , including sex offenders . 
Megan 's Law recently has brought the debate to the fore . 
The law -- named for 7-year-old <PERSON>Megan Kanka</PERSON> , who was raped and murdered by a twice-convicted sex offender -- requires officials notify communities when former child molesters enter town . 
In addition , <PERSON>Megan</PERSON> 's Law allows prosecutors to rank sex offenders according to their perceived risk to a community . 
Similar laws now exist in 36 states , including <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . 
On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> rejected a challenge to <PERSON>Megan</PERSON> 's Law from a group of sex offenders in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> . 
While my heart and my sympathy support <PERSON>Megan</PERSON> 's Law , my mind tells me the law is unconstitutional and unjust . 
This is yet another case in which our passions overcome our reason and trample our rights . 
First , the recent <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> decision against the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> sex offenders marked a miscarriage of justice . 
The sex offenders committed their sexual crimes before community notification laws were on the books in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> ; however , when they were released from jail , they were made subject to these laws . 
But , the Constitution prohibits ex post facto laws . 
In other words , there is a prohibition against laws increasing a defendant 's punishment beyond those that exist when the crime was committed . 
Thus , a murderer can not be put on death row if the capital punishment did not exist until after he committed his murder . 
This prohibition of ex post facto laws allows some sense of justice . 
A person committing a crime knows what punishment to expect . 
On the other hand , the <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> sex offenders left jail for an unexpected punishment -- community notification . 
Now , their privacy is violated under laws that did not exist at the times of their offenses . 
In addition , there are more general problems with <PERSON>Megan</PERSON> 's Law . 
Critics of the law argue it involves unconstitutional " double jeopardy . " 
Sex offenders receive their just punishment when they are incarcerated for a number of years . 
Megan 's Law , however , adds a second , unjust punishment -- namely , publicizing their names and addresses , leading to potential harassment and abuse . 
Supporters of Megan 's Law argue that community notification is necessary to protect children . 
They claim parents must be able to identify former child molesters in order to properly shield their children from these individuals . 
I absolutely sympathize with these individuals and know that , when I become a parent , I would want the same information to protect my children . 
The unfortunate irony of the situation is that the very analysis given to support <PERSON>Megan</PERSON> 's Law renders it unconstitutional . 
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> argued that " Megan 's Law did not involve " double jeopardy " because " the state had imposed no restrictions on a [ person 's ] ability to live and work in a community ... " This analysis is illogical . 
The purpose of Megan 's Law is to remove the privacy of the sex offender so the people in a community can treat the individual differently . 
Certainly , <PERSON>Megan</PERSON> 's Law will make this individual 's assimilation into a community complicated -- constituting a second punishment . 
If we do accept <PERSON>Megan</PERSON> 's Law , why should it only apply to sex offenders ? 
If the purpose is to protect children , should n't we also notify communities with former drug dealers who have sold to children ? 
If our goal is to identify potential threats to society , should n't we force convicted drunk drivers to place special stickers on their cars saying , " I 'm a convicted drunk driver ? " 
We have to assume an individual is rehabilitated after his punishment and allow him to get on with his life . 
If we believe child molestation is such a terrible crime -- which I believe it is -- we should have life sentences without parole instead of community notification . 
Once an individual returns to society we at least must allow him to lead a private life .
