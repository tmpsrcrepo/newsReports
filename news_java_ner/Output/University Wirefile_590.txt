The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will begin to accept applications for Resident Advisors in the next two weeks - with Focused Area applications due <DATE>Jan. 16</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>First Year and Upperclass Area</ORGANIZATION> applications due <DATE>Jan. 17</DATE> . 
Applicants , who will receive decisions in <DATE>March</DATE> , will complete a written application and undergo group and individual interviews to determine who will supervise on-Grounds housing . 
A comprehensive application Fourth-year <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Sarah Rennich</PERSON> was an RA during her second and third years - first in <LOCATION>Bonnycastle</LOCATION> and then in <LOCATION>Metcalf</LOCATION> . 
" I became an RA my second year ... because I wanted to stay more engaged and involved in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , " <PERSON>Rennich</PERSON> said . 
Rennich said the application process , run almost entirely by the RAs themselves , was reasonably comprehensive . " 
[ The group interview ] gives you a really good idea about how people are going to interact with others , " <PERSON>Rennich</PERSON> said . 
" The one-on-one [ interview ] was more personal motivations and work style . " 
Fourth-year <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Vishwa Bhuta</PERSON> agreed , saying the process was fairly straightforward . 
Bhuta , who was an RA her second year and a Senior Resident her third year , said the SR application process was even shorter , because applicants for the position have already been employed by <ORGANIZATION>Residence Life</ORGANIZATION> . 
A helping hand Rennich detailed her three main responsibilities as an RA : informal advising , enforcement of policy - which includes being on coverage for her dorm twice a month - and putting on educational programs for her residents . 
" It is very easy to get wrapped up into your own concerns and stresses , " <PERSON>Rennich</PERSON> said . 
" Being an RA , you take on the responsibility of being concerned with how others are doing as well . " 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Rachel Moffitt</PERSON> said she applied because she wanted to ensure incoming students have a positive experience at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> - something lacking in her own first year . 
" My first-year experience was not exactly ideal , and I had watched people have really great RAs , " <PERSON>Moffitt</PERSON> said . 
" My RAs were n't receptive to the needs of everyone on my hall [ so ] I wanted to create another community within the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . " 
Once in the position , <PERSON>Moffitt</PERSON> said the position was different from her initial expectations - and she was surprised by the gravity of the situations she had to handle . 
" I think a lot of people join Res Life thinking that you plan some events and join some friends , " she said . 
" The things you get trained on - the eating disorders , the sexual assaults - you never expect to deal with it . 
You do . " 
<PERSON>Bhuta</PERSON> said the job , for both RAs and <ORGANIZATION>SRs</ORGANIZATION> , requires a lot of variation based on the needs of residents . 
" You ca n't teach a step-by-step procedure for people , " she said . 
" One eating disorder is never going to look like another eating disorder . 
Really , the way that you relate to your residents is variable . " 
<PERSON>Moffitt</PERSON> said she was surprised by the time commitment when she started the position . 
" You do n't know what the time constraints are because there are n't any , " she said . 
For <PERSON>Bhuta</PERSON> , the transition to being an SR was a big change , with heightened responsibility and more administrative duties . 
She held office hours for her residents - which numbered 220 compared to 23 as an RA - and she served as a liaison between the RAs and the administration . 
" Certainly , it was a little overwhelming at the beginning , " she said . 
" Res Staff does a really good job of having a support system . 
The other RAs were very helpful and very kind . " 
Bhuta said she received much help from her area coordinator , a staff supervisor in Residence Life , as an SR and from one of the two co-chairs in Residence Life . 
" As an SR I had a similar support system , " <PERSON>Bhuta</PERSON> said . 
" I was under the guidance of an area coordinator and a co-chair . 
The co-chair position was the last student position in Res Staff . 
They do n't actually have residents themselves . 
They just help manage the RAs and the SRs . " 
Challenges working for <ORGANIZATION>Residence Life Despite</ORGANIZATION> intensive training , the Housing and Residence Life system is not without flaws . 
A first-year area RA , who asked to remain anonymous , said the <ORGANIZATION>Housing and Residence Life</ORGANIZATION> system has rules in place that make it difficult to do the work he thinks is important - forcing him to plan activities with little meaning or relevance to his residents . 
" I think it is a line a lot of RAs have to toe , " he said . 
" Sometimes I 'm torn between feeling [ that ] I need to check my RA to-do list boxes versus doing what I feel and know is the best for my residential community . " 
Former RA and <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> alumna <PERSON>Arushi Kumar</PERSON> said a main problem with the system was its readiness to punish RAs but slowness to recognize exceptional work . 
" I think that RAs are given a lot of responsibilities and a lot of resources to help them with them , but there is not a great system to recognize the work that RAs do on an everyday basis , " <PERSON>Kumar</PERSON> said . 
" Sometimes we get the feeling that administrators get the idea that they have the perfect system . " 
<PERSON>Moffitt</PERSON> said that though her job was largely positive , the professional staff was , at times , slow to respond to concerns . 
" A lot of times , once you go to these [ upper ] levels , they are not just very efficient with things , " she said . 
" They do n't always follow through and they are not always very personal about it . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Tiffany Conde</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Area Coordinator for Residence Life</ORGANIZATION> , said the organization tries to keep communication open so RAs can share their concerns with the professional staff . 
" We hope that if current staffers are concerned about timely follow-up , that they feel empowered to bring forward this concern to their direct supervisor so we can have an opportunity to understand their perspective and address any issues , " <ORGANIZATION>Conde</ORGANIZATION> said in an email . 
RAs also have the opportunity to address concerns with their SRs at weekly meetings and through semesterly evaluations , she said . 
Leaving Residence <PERSON>Life Bhuta</PERSON> , like <PERSON>Rennich</PERSON> and <PERSON>Moffitt</PERSON> , decided to leave Residence Life her fourth year to expand her experience during her last year at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I never lived off-Grounds , and I had decided that I did not want to venture out into the real world without ever having the experience of paying rent , " <PERSON>Bhuta</PERSON> said . 
" I also wanted to live with my friend . 
It was a difficult decision to leave Res staff . 
I wanted to focus on other leadership positions . " 
<PERSON>Moffitt</PERSON> said her decision to leave was difficult , but having more time in her schedule and personal life is valuable . 
" It is nice to have time to focus <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> on my academics and jobs , " <PERSON>Moffitt</PERSON> said . 
Rennich decided to leave so she could live on the <LOCATION>Lawn</LOCATION> . 
" It was a pretty easy choice for me , " she said . 
" I might have left anyway , because I never had had a real grown up experience . " 
Though she is no longer an RA , <PERSON>Moffitt</PERSON> said she still makes opportunities to connect with her former residents . 
" I still see them at least once a week , " she said . 
" We were all very close . 
I go over to their apartment . 
It is the same thing as if I went over to their suite and just hung out . " 
Rennich sees her former residents through rock climbing club . 
Ultimately , <PERSON>Bhuta</PERSON> said the experience was an impactful one for both her and her residents . 
" To be a part of that journey with them is really , really something special , " <PERSON>Bhuta</PERSON> said . 
" Coming in , I do n't think I would have realized that I would get out of it as much as I did . 
I wanted to help people [ but ] I did not realize how much it would help me . 
It really helps you grow into a mature person . 
You have people looking up to you . "
