<DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> was the perfect celebratory end to a fantastic regular season , as the Cavaliers emerged ACC champs . 
I left the <TIME>Corner that night</TIME> still full of all the joy and excitement practically spilling out of the bars , reveling in how good it felt in that moment to be a student at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Walking home with a slight sway in my step , I was unconcerned by the three men approaching until I realized they were approaching me , and they were yelling . 
I found myself suddenly surrounded by three guys spitting words like " femi-nazi b **** " and " c *** " in my face , pushing me back and forth between them . 
They had clearly recognized me from a presentation I had given on sexual assault and they were clearly angry about it . 
I remember one of them shoving me and saying that I was just bitter because I just needed a " good f ****** . " 
At some point they ran out of derogatory words for " female " and headed to bars . 
I was able to walk away , but the encounter left an awfully bitter taste in my mouth . 
So why write about this incident ? 
My intention here is not to suggest that the behavior of a few drunk guys represents the whole of men at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
But I do want to raise some questions about risk . 
I fully recognize that I incurred some level of risk that night - that 's the nature of walking alone intoxicated - but in nearly four years I 've never felt unsafe walking here . 
The more insidious notion that I had incurred risk because of my and my fellow peer educators ' work concerning sexual assault , consent and bystander intervention - and as a female advocate in particular - upsets me . 
I 'm not aggrieved for myself about <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> ; I 'm aggrieved for what this incident says about the safety of my fellow peer educators . 
It had never occurred to me that the peer education work I 've committed myself to has the potential to create a retaliatory impulse . 
And why should it ? 
In recent years , the educational aspect of the work has increasingly focused on emphasizing the existence of male survivors and the importance of bystander intervention . 
We have worked toward promoting healthy sexual attitudes for men and women , and educating people about the fact that a small minority of men commits the majority of rapes . 
I wonder how that message can be so infuriating . 
I wonder why the only avenue these men think they had was to physically accost someone rather than talking . 
I wonder if it is perhaps that I am taken to represent broader discourses of feminism and gender equity that are outside the actual content of my words . 
Although I have never actively or intentionally made it my goal to demonize men ( they are , after all , my friends and my lovers ) , am I associated with that anti-male line of thought and then transformed into a site onto which someone feels they can place their anger ? 
I am concerned that the violent anger had an overtly sexual component to it - that one of the guys thought my problem was that I just had n't been " f ***** hard enough . " 
To say as a survivor it was a triggering experience is a dramatic understatement . 
I wonder where this impulse came from and how widespread it is , because personally I 've had the joy of knowing men and women who will disagree with and debate me , but never try to harm me . 
I have felt safe and at home here at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , even despite my assault first year , and especially in light of the recent moves by the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> to show support ( i.e. the Handprint Project that occurred before Boy 's Bid Night ) . 
I have felt encouraged and welcomed by the changes I see the community making , so where did these three angry men come from ? 
I hope to gain some insight into why this confrontation occurred . 
In the meanwhile , I 'll be taking kickboxing classes just in case my line of work draws any more violent detractors . 
But I worry about the nature of this work , the nature of that response on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> , and I worry for my fellow educators .
