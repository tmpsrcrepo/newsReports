Xiaoqi Li | The Cavalier Daily The show 's opening was inspired by the rebirth associated with chrysalides . 
Student models wore clothes they said made them feel empowered . 
The showcase aimed to emphasize the role of self expression in recovery from trauma associated with sexual violence . 
Helping Advocate Rights Through Stories organized Empowerment Through Fashion this past week - a showcase in recognition of <ORGANIZATION>National Sexual Assault Awareness Month</ORGANIZATION> . 
The event served to underscore fashion 's relationship with self expression and recovery from trauma . 
" The whole premise of this week is reclaiming the meaning of our bodies and our sexuality by what we choose to wear , " third-year <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Elyse Eilerman</PERSON> said . 
" I think fashion is a good vehicle to do that because survivors often feel like they do n't have control over their bodies or that it has been taken away from them . " 
The event consisted of a fashion show featuring <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students as models . 
<PERSON>Eilerman</PERSON> said the show 's opening was inspired by chrysalis - the transformational stage of a butterfly 's life - and featured models entering in outfits of white followed by those in increasingly vibrant colors . 
The second scene took an avant-garde angle , and the third focused on the extreme personal styles of the models . 
The showcase closed with the models wearing blank t-shirts on which they wrote what beauty and fashion means to them . 
" The ideology behind this is that no matter what someone is wearing , whether it be a revealing outfit , it does n't mean that anyone has the right to sexually assault you , " fourth-year College student <ORGANIZATION>Ola Bam</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" So , just having power and domain over what you wear and expressing yourself in any way that you want . " 
Throughout the event , students delivered song and spoken word performances to raise awareness of sexual violence . 
" I feel like fashion is very relevant to sexual assault awareness as it is a means to express yourself and expressing yourself is something that is extremely important , especially when you face a trauma , or something that happens to your body , " <PERSON>Bam</PERSON> said . 
Third-year Engineering student <ORGANIZATION>Sri Ranga Aruna Kodakalla</ORGANIZATION> said the event also aimed at addressing the value of " owning " one 's body . 
" The main goal is just being able to have power and domain over your own body and being able to celebrate your body and see it for how it is , instead of trying to conform yourself to media standards of beauty - just be yourself and be whoever you want to be , " <PERSON>Ranga Aruna Kodakalla</PERSON> said . 
Members of HARTS are planning to screen the documentary they created depicting <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students answering questions about their fashion choices . 
" We just went around the community and asked people questions about what their style means to them and how their body empowers them and what else empowers them in their life , " <PERSON>Ranga Aruna Kodakalla</PERSON> said . 
Although the event was new to Grounds this year , members hope it will gain traction in years to come . 
" I hope to have this as a project every semester not just once a year , because I think it 's a project that can be ongoing and just opens up a discussion to just talk about not necessarily just sex-based violence or sexual assault , but also just issues facing [ the ] 18 to mid-30 year old age group , " <PERSON>Ranga Aruna Kodakalla</PERSON> said . 
" It 's important to constantly bring up the issue because there are a lot of people who simply do n't know where to turn to . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Ranga Aruna Kodakalla</ORGANIZATION> said in the end , it 's not about how many attend the event but rather how many attendees feel empowered after the experience . 
" I think that the goal is that the people who are involved in the event will gain a sense of confidence in what we are doing and the message we are sending , " <ORGANIZATION>Ranga Aruna Kodakalla</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" I hope that everyone feels a little bit more comfortable and a little bit more welcome in the community here . "
