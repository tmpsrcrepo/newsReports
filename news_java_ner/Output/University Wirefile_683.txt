The <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> ' Student Affairs and <ORGANIZATION>Athletics Committee</ORGANIZATION> met <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> and discussed the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Counseling and Psychological Services</ORGANIZATION> and new Athletics developments . 
<PERSON>Patricia Lampkin</PERSON> , the vice president and chief student affairs officer , said the administration is working to finalize an interim policy on sexual harassment and intimate partner violence following the Rolling Stone article and its fallout last semester . 
" Student safety will remain a critical focus this <DATE>spring</DATE> , " <PERSON>Lampkin</PERSON> said . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is conducting Green Dot training on sexual assault prevention and awareness this week . 
CAPS Director <PERSON>Tim Davis</PERSON> then told the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> about the dramatic increase in demand CAPS has faced , up <PERCENT>93 percent</PERCENT> from <DATE>2003</DATE> . 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said the issues young adults face are getting more severe , and CAPS is on pace for referring a record number of students for psychiatric hospitalization . 
" Depression is up , stress is up , " <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said . 
" It appears that students are more accepting of the idea of reaching out . " 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> remains at a high risk for student suicide , and students who know peers committed suicide are more likely to do so themselves . 
" Everyone in this room is aware that we lost three students to suicide <DATE>last fall</DATE> , " <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said . 
" Our community remains at very elevated risk for more suicide . " 
As a silver lining , <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said the rate of suicide is lower at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> than it is among college students nationally , but CAPS continues increased suicide prevention training . 
Faculty are taking more of a role in student health . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> made faculty mandatory reporters when they hear about incidents of sexual assault starting this academic year , and <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said 500 faculty have undergone suicide prevention training . 
" Although all students will not come to CAPS , we can still help all students , " <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said . 
" Faculty need to slow down a little bit and notice opportunities for interaction with students . " 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said college student brains are malleable , so they are responsive to counseling . 
He said 1,300 students said they would have dropped out of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> if not for counseling according to CAPS internal survey data . 
" In an average year , we see about <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> of the [ University ] student body [ per year ] , " <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said . " 
[ Females ] account for <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> [ of patients ] , " and the average length of counseling is four-and-half sessions , down from six previously . 
Board member <PERSON>Stephen Long</PERSON> said CAPS may be in need of increased funding to meet future demand . 
<PERSON>Lampkin</PERSON> said CAPS is funded through the student fee as a part of <ORGANIZATION>Student Health</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> did not make any firm request for a greater budget . 
" Counseling services at a place like this are a [ great ] investment , " <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said . 
University Athletic Director <PERSON>Craig Littlepage</PERSON> and his staff then discussed new NCAA rules for the big five athletic conferences , which includes the <ORGANIZATION>Atlantic Coast Conference</ORGANIZATION> . 
Those schools can now offer scholarship athletes some additional money for the full cost of college attendance , an amount up to <MONEY>$ 3,200</MONEY> to <MONEY>$ 4,600</MONEY> at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The additional money would cover travel to and from school and incidental expenses while there . " 
[ The cost would amount to ] an additional <MONEY>1.3 million dollars</MONEY> per year that would be added on to the [ total ] scholarship bill of the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Athletics Foundation</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Littlepage</PERSON> said . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> needs to offer the additional scholarship to remain competitive , <PERSON>Littlepage</PERSON> said . 
Other rule changes include allowing athletes to use future earnings to take out insurance for a career-ending injury , student athletes being permitted to vote at the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> convention and allowing schools to offer students four-year scholarships . 
Currently , colleges are only allowed to offer students one-year renewable scholarships ( which are typically renewed by <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> ) . 
<PERSON>Littlepage</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> would soon have to confront the issue of trust funds . 
A recent federal court decision allowed schools to set up trust funds for college athletes from which they can pull following the end of their college careers . 
The <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> appealed the decision . 
" We 're getting into a gray area that looks , feels and sounds like pay for play for student athletes , " <PERSON>Littlepage</PERSON> said .
