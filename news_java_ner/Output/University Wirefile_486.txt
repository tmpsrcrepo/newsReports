The <ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> is looking to revamping its sexual misconduct subcommittee , signifying a push to become more involved in sexual assault prevention on Grounds . 
The reconfigured subcommittee will seek to keep the organization more involved in <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> efforts to prevent sexual assault . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has made greater investments this year in sexual assault prevention awareness and programs to reduce sexual misconduct . 
One outcome of this push has been the Hoos Got Your Back campaign , which aims to combat sexual assault by increasing bystander awareness and fostering supportive responses to misconduct when it occurs . 
<ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee Chair Timothy Kimble</ORGANIZATION> , a fourth-year College student , said he hopes the sexual misconduct subcommittee will bring the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> closer to the work of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I would love for the sexual misconduct subcommittee to be a way for the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> to stay involved with issues of sexual misconduct , " <PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> said in an email . 
" I [ want ] to make sure that our subcommittee [ will ] be able to positively contribute to the work already being done . " 
<PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> said he thinks <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has already made great strides and said there is a range of ways <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> can pitch in . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition</ORGANIZATION> has been doing great work , and I would like for the chair of the subcommittee to serve as a liaison , connecting the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> to the [ Sexual Violence Prevention Council ] , " <PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> said . 
" I think that this will facilitate a closer , more involved relationship between our groups . 
That could take a variety of forms , but the goal is to work with the efforts already being made . " 
<PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> said he has been working to form a new sexual misconduct subcommittee since the beginning of the semester , in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administrators and members of the SVPC . 
Associate Dean of Students <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> said she was excited to work with the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> more extensively ; the group has previously assisted in misconduct-related planning and campaign development . 
" In the past , this subcommittee has assisted with the planning of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> mock hearing , " <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> said in an email . 
" Some <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> leaders were also involved in the development of the Hoos Got Your Back campaign this <DATE>summer</DATE> . " 
<PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> said the direction of the subcommittee is still very much undefined . 
<PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> said he hopes to select subcommittee leaders this week . 
" I 'm looking for someone to head up the subcommittee and will be selecting that person this week , " <PERSON>Kimble</PERSON> said . 
" This is still in progress . " 
Eramo said <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> 's movement to become further involved with sexual assault issues underlines the common cause felt by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
" I believe that we all have a role to play in ending sexual violence on Grounds and I 'm excited that this <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> subcommittee wants to take a more active role in working on prevention in addition to education about response , " <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> said . 
" I think their involvement solidifies the message that , whether or not this is an ' official ' roll of your organization , every organization - every person on Grounds - has a role to play in ending sexual violence here at U.Va . "
