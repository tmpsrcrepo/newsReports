<ORGANIZATION>Courtesy Wikimedia Commons The Virginia House of Delegates</ORGANIZATION> recently passed legislation which aids victims of sexual assault and protect students on college campuses . 
House Bill <DATE>1928</DATE> , introduced by <LOCATION>Del</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Rob Bell</PERSON> , R-Charlottesville , would require adding certain additional violent misdemeanors to the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> DNA database . 
Bell also introduced HB <DATE>1930</DATE> to require colleges to provide independent counseling services to victims , inform them of their legal options , and mandate reporting of sexual assault where necessary to protect the safety of the public and confidential review of all cases by a team including law enforcement officials . 
" Sexual assaults on campus has been a concern for some time , " <PERSON>Bell</PERSON> said in an email . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>Crime Commission</ORGANIZATION> looked at the campus police issue in <DATE>2011</DATE> . 
The goal is to do all we can to support the victim , while also preventing the next victim . 
Bell said he knows the issue has been pertinent , as he was a Class of <DATE>1988</DATE> graduate . 
" This has been an issue since I was at U.Va. , " he said , " So I 'm sure it is something we will continue to work on . " 
Bell said under the new bill , reports made to a responsible party will be transmitted to the Title IX coordinator . 
The coordinator will then assemble a review committee consisting of him/herself , a representative from the <ORGANIZATION>Student Affairs Office</ORGANIZATION> and a representative from local law enforcement to review the report . 
The report can remain confidential at the request of the victim . 
Identifying information about the victim will only be released if it is " necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals . " 
A review will also be conducted by the local <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> 's Attorney . 
Del . 
<PERSON>Jimmie Massie</PERSON> , R-Henrico , introduced HB <DATE>1785</DATE> , requiring campus police to notify the local <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> 's Attorney within 48 hours of a victim-initiated investigation . 
<PERSON>Massie</PERSON> said in light of the erroneously-reported Rolling Stone article and the tragedy of <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> it has become clear that assault problems exist at universities both public and private . 
" Our objective is to make our campuses as safe a place as we possibly can and to help the victims , catch the bad persons , and do all of it in a fair way , " <PERSON>Massie</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Massie</PERSON> said the initial reaction in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> was to institute mandatory reporting , but after working through it and speaking with victims , it became clear that in order to help to victims and apprehend those responsible , they needed to work closely with the victim . 
" There were a number of victim advocate groups that spoke to us and we had a lot of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students coming through here and the message was if you want to help the victims , if you want to catch bad persons , and do all that in fair manner , you need victims to come in and feel comfortable coming in and talking to you , " <PERSON>Massie</PERSON> said . 
In drafting the bills , comfort and respect for victims was a high priority . 
" They 've lost control of their body in a private situation , " <PERSON>Massie</PERSON> said . 
" The last thing they want is to lose control of information in a public manner . " 
<PERSON>Massie</PERSON> referenced his bill , <PERSON>Bell</PERSON> 's bill , and a third bill requiring sexual assault to be stamped on one 's transcript if found guilty of the offense , as results of objectives aiming to alleviate the problem of sexual assault on college campuses . 
" I think we 're going to have these three bills , or some form of them are going to come out this year and then we 're going to take a breather and see how they do , " <PERSON>Massie</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Massie</PERSON> said it would unrealistic to achieve perfection but lawmakers in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> are trying as hard as they can , and if holes are found in the legislation that need to be filled , they will be tweaked further .
