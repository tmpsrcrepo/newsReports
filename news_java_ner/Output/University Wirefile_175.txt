The victim was taken to the <ORGANIZATION>University Hospital</ORGANIZATION> and treated for minor injuries .

On <DATE>Sept. 14</DATE> at approximately <TIME>9 a.m.</TIME> , three men reportedly abducted a 20-year-old woman on Rt. 29 North near <LOCATION>Hydraulic Road</LOCATION> . 
They took her to a wooded area where they raped and robbed her before releasing the victim . 
The suspects have been identified as three black males between the ages of 19 and 25 . 
Police do not have evidence indicating the two incidents are connected , <LOCATION>Albemarle County</LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Lee Catlin</PERSON> said . 
But " whenever you have anything that happens close together , of a similar nature , that 's considered as a possibility , " <PERSON>Catlin</PERSON> said . 
Those crimes are atypical for the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> area , she said . 
" In the County , the great majority of crimes are property crimes , " <PERSON>Catlin</PERSON> said . 
Students should keep their doors locked and windows closed , <PERSON>Catlin</PERSON> said , and call police if they detect any suspicious activity around their residences . 
" It 's pretty surprising , " said <PERSON>Pepin Tuma</PERSON> , second-year Law student residing at <LOCATION>Ivy Gardens</LOCATION> . 
" Most of us think of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> as a pretty safe area . " 
Tuma said he would think more about security issues . 
" Security is normally in the back of your mind , but it 's not a primary concern , " he said . 
The assault " definitely makes you think twice about everything from leaving your door open to walking alone . "
