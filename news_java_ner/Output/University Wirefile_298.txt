In <DATE>2003</DATE> , a Sudanese government-sponsored campaign of rape , pillage and genocidal mass murder began in <LOCATION>Darfur</LOCATION> and has since left nearly 200,000 dead . 
Since then , schools and states around the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> have withdrawn funding from companies that may have indirectly played a role in this tragedy . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , on the other hand , refuses even to disclose a breakdown of its funding so that students can see whether their cash is being used to finance genocide . 
Students themselves appear to be largely ignorant of the possibility that they might be funding genocide . 
With such a disgusting sense of ignorance from the student body and equally despicable lack of ethics displayed by the administration and its private counterparts , it is shameful to be part of an institution that trumpets its empty ideals of " honor " and " ' Jeffersonian traditions . " 
This needs to change if we are to align our ideals with specific actions on critical issues . 
The administration has shown a blatant disregard for ethical concerns raised by the student movement on divestment . 
Members of Students Taking Action Now : Darfur have continually been given the bureaucratic run-around in trying to launch a divestment campaign , a tactic which has been successful in other institutions of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's caliber , such as <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> first stated that it had privatized the handling of its portfolio to the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Investment Managing Corporation</ORGANIZATION> , but upon approaching them , STAND members found two things : First as a private company , UVIMCO is not required by law to comply with <ORGANIZATION>Freedom of Information Requests</ORGANIZATION> asking for investment records , and . 
second , UVIMCO Chief Executive Officer <PERSON>Chris Brightman</PERSON> said that company policy was determined by a board of directors , including three members who also serve on the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> . 
How surprising . 
<PERSON>Leonard Sandridge</PERSON> , executive vice president and chief operating officer , pledged to find out what companies are on the investment portfolio but has yet to do so . 
I could go on all day talking about technicalities , but it does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has been uncooperative in giving students the right to know about whether their cash is exchanged for blood . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is abusing freedom of expression by hiding its investment portfolio as a public entity under the guise of a private company . 
But before we start hurling rocks at the administration , it is important to question why the administration in this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has been allowed to be so uncooperative when divestment movements at other universities have succeeded . 
Not surprisingly , it is student ignorance of this campaign and the issue in general that has allowed the administration to get away with its do n't - care attitude . 
Last year , STAND conducted a student referendum on the issue -- <PERCENT>8.5 percent</PERCENT> of students voted , which displays sheer ignorance in the first place . 
This lack of response is humiliating for an institution based on honor and justice . 
According to STAND president <PERSON>Taylor Michael Maltz</PERSON> and divestment co-chair <PERSON>Sharon Stein</PERSON> , it is also the chief obstacle to STAND 's campaign . 
This brings us back to the essential question -- what to do ? 
STAND has taken the right approach in this regard . 
<ORGANIZATION>Darfur Awareness Week</ORGANIZATION> was a great success -- for instance , support for an online divestment petition has doubled since the week began from 200 to about 400 advocates . 
Also , according to <PERSON>Maltz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stein</PERSON> , STAND has successfully pressured the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> by way of a FOIA request to release investment records from <DATE>2003</DATE> , the year before they privatized their portfolio and the year the genocide began . 
The <DATE>2003</DATE> Investment Report may hold the key to overcoming the frustrating obstacle of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and its affiliates ' policy of withholding possible evidence to support the divestment campaign . 
Alongside its awareness promotion , STAND has also allied with various other groups on grounds such as the University Democrats in order to form a coalition with greater political weight against the administration . 
Other groups on Grounds must join this cause since it is not an issue lobbied by one group but one that threatens the central ideals of justice our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> was founded upon . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has not been the biggest fan of divestment initiatives -- for example , it only divested from apartheid <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> after the state made a declaration for schools to do so . 
We thus can not blame the administration alone because it has merely exploited the weakness in student inability to facilitate change . 
Whether the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> places profits above ethics or it just ca n't be bothered to respond considering the lack of support for the campaign , we need to address this issue . 
As <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION> 's Cassius tells <PERSON>Brutus</PERSON> in <PERSON>Julius Caesar</PERSON> , " the fault ... is not in our stars , but in ourselves . " 
But this time , the fault is our ignorance of our indirect involvement in the slaughter of thousands .
