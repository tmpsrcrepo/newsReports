This week , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> 's student body is committing to Take Back the <TIME>Night</TIME> . 
For the enormous population of students who care passionately about gender violence issues , panels on supporting survivors , bystander intervention workshops and an open arts slam - among other events - are valuable stepping stones on the road to a gender violence-free community . 
For survivors of sexual violence , these events have the potential to be cathartic and tremendously educational for the broader <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
Unfortunately , the effectiveness of Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> is limited in the self-selection of its attendees . 
Short of doing the impossible and mandating every student 's attendance , there is no way for <ORGANIZATION>Take Back the Night</ORGANIZATION> to take its message to everyone . 
This is especially problematic given that the Rape , Abuse and <ORGANIZATION>Incest National Network</ORGANIZATION> ( RAINN ) , the country 's largest anti-gender violence organization , points to research that <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of rapes on college campuses are committed by only <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> of men . 
Rather than a wide swath of the collegiate community , there is a dangerous minority that has made rape and gender violence a lifestyle choice . 
Given that it is highly unlikely repeat perpetrators of sexual violence are reachable through more outreach , raising awareness of rape culture must be coupled with policy changes that target perpetrators and effectively remove them from the community . 
To address issues around the adjudication of gender violence cases , the RAINN report recommends that colleges " de-emphasize internal judicial boards " like the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> ( full disclosure : I sit on the SMB ) that have historically struggled in handling the complex issues of gender violence . 
While the internal process has had its share of issues at various institutions nationwide , Dean Eramo states that sexual assault cases at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> are managed by " professional staff who are specially trained to manage these often very complicated cases , " in a way other institutions may not . 
Because it operates based on a " preponderance of evidence " standard based on Title IX and not a " beyond a reasonable doubt standard , " the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's internal institutions for sanctioning perpetrators of gender violence are often able to reach appropriate outcomes in " word against word " cases in a way the traditional legal system is not , because of the role of circumstantial evidence . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is responding to newfederal policyand intensifying its commitment to fighting gender violence by making dating , domestic violence and stalking stand alone charges rather than falling under the vague umbrella of sexual harassment . 
Changes like these will bring clarity to sentencing and illustrate more clearly that gender-based violence does n't begin and end with rape . 
Policy changes should n't end with refining definitions of sexual harassment . 
As recommended by the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Leadership Council</ORGANIZATION> co-chair <PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> should consider codifying suspension until absence - in which a student found guilty of sexual misconduct would be suspended until the victim graduates - as a punishment for sexual assault . 
The option of expulsion is always available as mandated by Title IX , but a written <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> guideline would ensure that those found guilty of sexual violence merit total rejection from the community of trust . 
Until that changes , the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> is compelled to consider a wide range of punishments . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> itself can also take more action on raising awareness to complement the work of independent groups . 
Take Back the <TIME>Night</TIME> and organizations like One in Four and One Less do valuable work in explaining what rape is and how to prevent it , but the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should distribute pamphlets at the beginning of orientation to all first year students to make them aware of the resources available to them if they have experienced gender violence . 
The longer a victim is confused about where to turn after an assault , the more difficult it becomes to find the truth . 
Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> week offers the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> a unique opportunity to publicly stand in solidarity with survivors of gender-based violence . 
As the week draws to a close , we should strive to make sure our policy reflects that solidarity as much as possible .
