In response to widespread dissent over a new method to apprehend the serial rapist , <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> students , faculty and other community members met with local police officials in an open forum <TIME>last night</TIME> to address concerns with what some are calling " racial profiling " by police . 
In its ongoing hunt for the serial rapist , the <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Department</ORGANIZATION> recently implemented a new strategy to aid in the investigation . 
Under the new system , certain black men are asked to voluntarily undergo a DNA test called a buccal swab test in order to eliminate their names from a database of contacts . 
African-American Affairs <PERSON>Dean M. Rick Turner</PERSON> opened the forum with an address to an audience of more than 50 people , including six local television news networks . 
<PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said the impetus for the meeting was the case of graduate Education student <PERSON>Steven Turner</PERSON> , who was stopped by police officers on two separate occasions to give a DNA sample but declined both times . 
" I understood that a person would be stopped for a reason , " <PERSON>M. Rick Turner</PERSON> said . 
M. <PERSON>Rick Turner</PERSON> also said , however , that repeated requests by police officers for DNA samples from those who do not consent to take the test can be seen as a civil rights violation . 
" I believe that we have some officers here who are untrained , " he said . 
" This is bordering on violating someone 's civil rights . 
Now all of this might be legal ... but it 's not right . " 
M. <PERSON>Rick Turner</PERSON> emphasized that the police should use a less " threatening and intimidating " method in their pursuit of the serial rapist . 
" I know the police have to do their work , " <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said . 
" I want them to do their work . 
But I want trained policeman to approach African-American men with some sense of respect . " 
<PERSON>Steven Turner</PERSON> questioned the nature of the investigation , raising a concern of whether current police tactics are incidents of racial profiling . 
" Because the suspect is a black man , every black man is suspect , " <PERSON>Steven Turner</PERSON> said . 
" The more indiscriminate the search , the closer it is to discrimination . " 
Quoting <PERSON>Martin Luther King</PERSON> , Jr. , <PERSON>Steven Turner</PERSON> said he " can not be silent , and will not be silent . " 
" <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , I know you can hear me , " he said , " but is anyone listening ? " 
Charlottesville Police Chief <PERSON>Tim Longo</PERSON> led the discussion , saying he was up to the challenge and the opportunity to address community concerns , especially those pertaining to alleged racial profiling . 
In response to a question of whether such a tactic would be used if the suspect was not a black male , <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> said the same method would be used regardless of race or gender . 
" From an investigative standpoint , it 's a tried and proven and highly conclusive strategy , " <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> said . 
" If they 're legally permissible , we have to evaluate them , and that 's what we 've done here . " 
<PERSON>Longo</PERSON> added that all police officials involved have gone through training in " bias-based policing . " 
Detective Sgt. <PERSON>Ralph Barfield</PERSON> , an expert in forensics and DNA , said the system is new and everyone is learning how to use the new technology . 
" In defense of what we 're doing , I 'd say we 're doing the best we can as we go , " <PERSON>Barfield</PERSON> said .
