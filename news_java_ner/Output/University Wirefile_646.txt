Sexual assault has firmly grounded itself in the forefront of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> policy-making after the tragic murder of second-year College student <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> and the scathing remarks from the Rolling Stone article last semester . 
Currently , a mad scramble to pass preventative legislation has overtaken the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> , with new ideas and new bills being churned out at a rapid pace . 
While many bills have passed both houses of the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> with little contention , including mandatory reporting of sexual assault to a college 's Title IX Coordinator , one bill - for good reason - has not had quite the unanimous reception . 
The bill is <ORGANIZATION>House Bill 1888</ORGANIZATION> , which requires that all public and private universities in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> place a " prominent notation " on the transcripts of every student who " has been suspended for , has been permanently dismissed for , or withdraws from the institution while under investigation for a violation of the institution 's . . . rules . . . governing student sexual misconduct . " 
Indicated by the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> 's hesitation to pass it , this bill extends far beyond the scope of prevention of sexual assault , delving into a hazy territory that - if the bill is passed - will have serious implications for college students across the state . 
Naturally , the intentions of this bill are good , but from the point of view of a current college student , HB <DATE>1888</DATE> is a clear and dangerous violation of personal liberty . 
I would like to point to one word in HB <DATE>1888</DATE> that is particularly interesting : " investigation . " 
Investigation implies that initiative is being taken which is grounded in the assumptions or allegations of a group of individuals . 
But what if these allegations are wrong ? 
A recent study conducted on over 100 university sexual assault cases found that anywhere from <PERCENT>2-10 percent</PERCENT> of sexual assault convictions are based on false accusations . 
Although this study does not contain any conclusions on the number of false sexual assault accusations in general , the total percentage of wrongful allegations would naturally be much greater . 
Thus , at any given moment in time , a significant portion of investigations regarding sexual assault is grounded in falsehood . 
According to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's policy , practically every faculty member on Grounds is required to report accusations of sexual assault when told by a student , and the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will subsequently conduct an investigation on said allegations . 
This means students have the power to easily launch sexual assault investigations on one of their peers , regardless of whether the accusations are factual . 
If HB <DATE>1888</DATE> were to pass , the wrongly accused would fall victim to a grave violation of their personal liberty . 
Without any due process of law , the accused would potentially be discriminated against by universities - many of which require a transcript to enroll - and by potential employers , who often look at students ' transcripts to view their academic virtues . 
Branding these students with the " scarlet letter " of sexual assault would entrap them in the cruel vice of a corrupt and unjust system , revoking their natural right to social mobility . 
It is not the duty of university investigators to ruin a student 's life - leave that to the courts . 
Across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , lawmakers uphold the American tenet that the accused are innocent until proven guilty , so why should university sexual assault cases be held to a different standard ? 
Placing that notation on students ' transcripts could potentially follow them for the rest of their lives . 
Every denial of a transfer request and every refusal of employment placed upon an innocent student will have a drastic impact on his future , simultaneously tarnishing the constitutional mandate of the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> legislative system to uphold the " certain inherent rights " of all of its citizens . 
Justice should never be grasped by the wavering hands of assumption . 
Those accused of sexual assault should not have to pay the consequences until they are proven guilty of the crime they may have committed ; otherwise , a dangerous precedent will be set for the future of legislative policy in this nation . 
I refuse to live in a country where an abandonment from the legal process is observed as a reputable means of tarnishing an individual 's livelihood . 
I refuse to stand idly by while hot-heads in positions of power advance severely impactful legislation without considering the ramifications of their actions . 
I refuse to forgo my human right to pursue excellence ; I will not let legislators sweep the carpet of the <ORGANIZATION>American Dream</ORGANIZATION> out from under an innocent student 's feet . 
If justice means anything to the " good people of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , " HB <DATE>1888</DATE> should not pass .
