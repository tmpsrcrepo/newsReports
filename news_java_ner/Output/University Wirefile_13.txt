Sexual Assault Facts and <ORGANIZATION>Education</ORGANIZATION> , a student-run organization , is struggling to keep up its service of informing the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
SAFE President <PERSON>Sarah Curtis-Fawley</PERSON> said since SAFE receives no support or funding from any offices at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , when students fail to involve themselves , the organization fails to help students . 
Sexual Assault Education Coordinator <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> and Curtis-Fawley both agreed that because SAFE deals with sexual assault issues , student involvement tends to be low . 
" It is difficult to do this work , and it is difficult as a student group to do this , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
Curtis-Fawley agreed with <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> , stating that involvement in SAFE can be emotionally draining . 
" It 's a hard commitment , " she said . 
" People do n't want to deal with [ sexual assault ] emotionally . " 
University officials agreed that while SAFE is not the only resource for sexual assault education , if the organization closed because of lack of a student support , students would be less knowledgeable about sexual assault . 
" We have Residence Life staff involved , and Grounds for Discussion . 
There would still be education but [ SAFE 's ] efforts would be missed , " Dean of Students <PERSON>Robert T. Canevari</PERSON> said . 
Kaplan agreed , saying the loss of SAFE would largely impact the student community , not only because SAFE can be used as a sexual assault education resource , but also because it provides support for sexual assault survivors . 
Curtis-Fawley said she wants to keep SAFE a student-run organization , and student support must grow to enable SAFE to service all those who want sexual assault education programs . 
" I would like to see an involvement of 40 to 50 students , " <PERSON>Curtis-Fawley</PERSON> said . 
" We have people calling us and we do n't have the capacity to help them . " 
Before the SAFE vigil held at the <LOCATION>Rotunda</LOCATION> <DATE>Jan. 27</DATE> for sexual assault victims , Curtis-Fawley said SAFE 's student involvement was at a severe low . 
She said only three or four students would come to SAFE meetings , but 20 or 30 students make up the organization 's e-mail list . 
Although <PERSON>Curtis-Fawley</PERSON> said student interest in the organization has been dwindling in recent months , the vigil renewed student motivation to get involved . 
" I was almost ready to give up until after the vigil -- it 's re-energizing to realize people do care , " <PERSON>Curtis-Fawley</PERSON> said . 
SAFE held the vigil six days after fourth-year College student <PERSON>Keith Guerrini</PERSON> was tried for sexual assault with the use of a chemical inducement . 
Although the judge ordered the case dismissed for insufficient evidence , Curtis-Fawley said the trial rejuvenated student energy at SAFE . 
She said the <PERSON>Guerrini</PERSON> case made the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community more aware of sexual assault , sparking interest in the vigil . 
" The case refocused people 's attention and made [ sexual assault ] real for them , " Curtis-Fawley said . 
She said the vigil increased publicity for the organization , resulting in new members who raised the number of students involved from 4 and 5 to between 10 and 15 , an improvement but not enough to support all of the needs of the community . 
To solve the problem of low student involvement and to keep the organization going , <ORGANIZATION>Curtis-Fawley</ORGANIZATION> said SAFE will publicize to increase student awareness , and conduct surveys to find out how <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students would like to see SAFE involved in sexual assault education .
