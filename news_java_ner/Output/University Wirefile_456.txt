<ORGANIZATION>Wesleyan University</ORGANIZATION> recently announced that all of its all-male residential fraternities must become co-ed within the next three years . 
The university 's president and the chairman of its <ORGANIZATION>Board of Trustees</ORGANIZATION> wrote an email to the student body saying " Our residential Greek organizations inspire loyalty , community , and independence . 
That 's why all our students should be eligible to join them . " 
The email explaining the change conspicuously lacks any mention of sexual assault , hazing or drug and alcohol abuse - the significant topics raised in <PERSON>Caitlin Flanagan</PERSON> 's <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> article , " The Dark Power of Fraternities , " which focuses on incidents at <ORGANIZATION>Wesleyan University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Portraying this change solely as a matter of " equity and inclusion , " as the email states , does not accurately represent the situation . 
The email makes no mention of sororities being required to change their membership , which effectively treats all-male groups differently than all-female groups . 
Wesleyan 's one sorority was perhaps not mentioned in the decision because according to the university 's website , the sorority does not have a house , and so it is not " residential . " 
But even so , the only logical reason the university would apply the co-ed mandate only to residential all-male organizations , is that it believes the conduct which occurs in those houses somehow needs to be remedied . 
The idea of a co-ed fraternity is not necessarily a bad one . 
There are co-ed fraternities already , but most are dedicated to service , or a specific academic or career interest , like engineering . 
Social fraternities are different in that they do not primarily devote themselves to one of the aforementioned purposes , and they value same-sex membership as a way of bonding . 
Admitting women to social fraternities is not a guaranteed remedy to the problems plaguing fraternity life - namely : sexual assault , alcohol abuse and hazing . 
Some think mandatory integration of women would help address the issue of sexual assault in fraternities , presumably because they think brothers will be more likely to respect women if they are members of equal status to the men . 
This approach has the potential to be effective , if male members do actually treat the female members equally . 
But the integration process could be risky for the women , and may actually exacerbate the problem of sexual violence . 
The prevalence of hazing ties into the risk posed to women entering fraternities for the first time . 
Most fraternities have new member pledging processes , and when the first female pledges will have only men as their superiors , there is great potential for the older members to exploit the women even more than they exploit the men during that process . 
Even though some fraternities have eliminated pledging in order to address hazing issues , we have argued that this approach is unlikely to be effective for individual chapters , because hazing is so ingrained in fraternity culture . 
When you add women into the mix , the power dynamic can be amplified . 
This is not to say that all fraternity men seek to exploit women . 
But even if brothers do treat their new female members as equals , there is no guarantee there will be any major change in behavior , with regards to other fraternity issues . 
A major fraternity problem which administrations say needs to be addressed is the abuse of drugs and alcohol . 
This was the justification of <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Trinity College</ORGANIZATION> when they mandated their fraternities become co-ed in <DATE>2012</DATE> . 
This logic , though , discounts the existence of drug and alcohol problems among women 's Greek life , which undoubtedly exists , even if it has not received as much publicity . 
At <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , during the Greek rush and bid period of <DATE>2013</DATE> , many students hospitalized because of excessive drinking were new sorority members . 
For the same reasons , admitting women will likely not be an effective remedy for hazing either , as women 's Greek life also has problems with hazing . 
Just recently , <ORGANIZATION>Jezebel</ORGANIZATION> revealed that <LOCATION>Miss America</LOCATION> 2015 <PERSON>Kira Kazantsev</PERSON> was expelled from the <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Phi</ORGANIZATION> sorority at <ORGANIZATION>Hofstra University</ORGANIZATION> for hazing pledges . 
Universities must find alternative methods to make Greek life safer , before presenting arguments about " equity and inclusion . " 
Equal access to Greek organizations is an entirely separate issue from the safety concerns . 
They must be dealt with separately if any change is to occur .
