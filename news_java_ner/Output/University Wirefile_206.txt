My favorite bumper sticker on my car reads like this : " The media is only as liberal as the conservative businesses that own them . " 
Some would complain that it 's too verbose for a bumper sticker , but I would argue the point is so significant it warrants breaking from the traditional epigram format . 
Contrary to what the raging right contends , particularly almost everyone on <ORGANIZATION>Fox News</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Ann Coulter</PERSON> , there is no liberal media . 
Maybe there was one in the past , but I can not emphasize this enough -- the era of the liberal media is over . 
The media , of course , is not the beacon of objectivity . 
The media obsesses on negative , sensationalist stories because that 's what draws in the readers and viewers . 
The media is not perfect , but it is far from the voice of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Committee</ORGANIZATION> . 
Admittedly , the lack of a liberal bias can be hard to identify . 
One has to ignore all the claptrap from conservative ideologues and actually analyze the media itself -- what a concept . 
During the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> years , I lost all faith in the so-called " liberal " media . 
They attacked <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> as if he was a true criminal like <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> . 
Even though they neglected stories such as allegations of <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> as a murderer and a rapist ( to the right , <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> clearly was some kind of maniacal , evil genius ) , they still attacked him for the worst of all crimes : oral sex . 
They did n't withhold any juicy details , and although both The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> and The <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post stuck up for <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> on the editorial page , the front page lacked such sympathy . 
Sex sells everywhere ; the media could n't resist the headlines of a presidential sex scandal . 
Sex -- and the profits associated with it -- apparently triumphed over the media 's firm belief to never be critical of a Democratic president . 
If the non-stop <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> harassment was not enough , the <DATE>2000</DATE> election should convince anyone that the liberal bias is dead . 
Al <PERSON>Franken</PERSON> pointed this out in his new book , " Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them , " and unlike <PERSON>Ann Coulter</PERSON> , his endnotes actually lead to reliable resources . 
A non-partisan group , the <ORGANIZATION>Pew Charitable Trusts Project for Excellence</ORGANIZATION> in Journalism , did a report on the media coverage of the candidates during the heart of the campaign : the debate season . 
They examined 1,149 news stories from different news outlets . 
They rated each story as positive , neutral or negative for each candidate . 
Positive stories for <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> outnumbered those for Gore nearly two to one ( 24 versus <PERCENT>13 percent</PERCENT> ) . 
Moreover , <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> also had more negative stories written about him ( 56 versus <PERCENT>49 percent</PERCENT> ) . 
Now unless compassionate conservative means New Deal liberal , the so-called liberal press actually leaned towards <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> . 
But apparently having the media support their candidate was n't enough to convince conservative advocates that the media was trying to hold them down . 
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's presidency has been one of the most unchallenged since <ORGANIZATION>LBJ</ORGANIZATION> . 
After the election , the media was soft on him for the sake of unity after the divisive ( aka stolen ) election . 
Once the media finally began to be critical of the president , <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> gave <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> a free pass once again . 
For most of the march to war , the major papers rarely , if ever , covered war protests . 
The major cable TV networks could barely restrain their excitement for war : MSNBC even had a countdown to war in the lower-left hand corner after <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> gave his ultimatum . 
More recently , when <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> finally admitted that there was " no evidence " of a connection between <PERSON>Saddam Hussein</PERSON> and <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> , The <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> , the bastion of liberalism , stuck the story on page A22 . 
They missed a chance to catch <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in his web of lies and dropped the ball . 
Perhaps they forgot about their liberal bias on that day . 
<ORGANIZATION>Fox News</ORGANIZATION> , perhaps the station guiltiest of bias , constantly tries to emphasize how their competitors are culpable for liberal bias . 
As an example , I was watching <PERSON>Hannity</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Colmes</ORGANIZATION> last <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> , <DATE>Oct. 9</DATE> , not only because I am a masochist , but because they released a poll which revealed that <PERCENT>14 percent</PERCENT> of Americans think the media is too conservative , while <PERCENT>45 percent</PERCENT> of Americans think the media is too liberal . 
However , this poll hardly passes as evidence of a true liberal bias ; it only offers proof at how vocal the conservatives are at spreading the lies of an unbalanced press . 
The conservative right will never drop the issue of the " liberal bias . " 
They will continue to try to brainwash Americans into thinking there is such a thing . 
And they succeed , for there is no liberal <PERSON>Ann Coulter</PERSON> or Rush Limbaugh ( thank goodness ) to counter their specious arguments . 
Just because more people think the media is too liberal does not actually make the media full of liberal bias , no matter what <PERSON>Sean Hannity</PERSON> would have the innocent public believe . 
If you want fair and balanced , there is no need to turn to <ORGANIZATION>Fox News</ORGANIZATION> -- it 's already in the mainstream .
