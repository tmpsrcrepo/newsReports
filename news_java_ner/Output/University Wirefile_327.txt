" SAFERIDE 'S purpose is to provide a safe passage for students who would otherwise have to walk alone at night , " claims SafeRide 's Web site . 
Unfortunately , this purpose fails to mention that only the passage of sober students is allowed by <ORGANIZATION>SafeRide</ORGANIZATION> . 
SafeRide 's restriction goes against the spirit of ensuring student safety and leaves those most vulnerable in danger . 
Let us examine the purpose of SafeRide more closely . 
Because of crime throughout the city , students may not feel comfortable walking home . 
This seems especially applicable for young woman who are susceptible to sexual assault . 
But students most susceptible to crime are those who are intoxicated . 
As countless studies show ( and any observer can see ) , alcohol causes the loss of fine motor coordination and reflexes . 
These effects put the intoxicated most at risk for assault , robbery , etc . 
Nevertheless , the administration may hesitate to agree that intoxicated individuals deserve SafeRide just as much as their sober counterparts . 
Students engaging in sometimes illegal drinking somehow make it seem that they do not deserve a convenience that someone studying at the library deserves . 
We should laud efforts to promote responsible drinking , but we must also recognize that nothing will deter college students from drinking . 
The administration should remain dedicated to all students , intoxicated or not . 
The statistics also support the need of SafeRide for the intoxicated . 
A <DATE>2004</DATE> joint study completed by the <ORGANIZATION>Harvard School of Public Health</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Saint Joseph 's University</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>the University of Arizona</ORGANIZATION> studied 119 schools nationwide with startling results . 
Women from colleges with medium and high binge-drinking rates had more than 1.5-times increased chance of being raped while being intoxicated versus those from schools with low binge-drinking rates . 
Obviously , the results of these studies call for more general measures , such as alcohol education and sexual assault education . 
But while it may be more important to address the cause of this problem in the long run , we can not forget to address the symptoms in the short run . 
This includes the institution of all sexual assault preventive measures . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University Police run SafeRide</ORGANIZATION> , and <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Captain <PERSON>Michael Coleman</PERSON> said there were three main reasons for prohibiting intoxicated people from using SafeRide . 
First , police officers have an obligation to arrest those who are intoxicated in public . 
Second , <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> stated , " Intoxicated people are unpredictable . " 
Intoxicated individuals could distract the driver , causing a safety hazard for all in the van . 
Finally , intoxicated individuals pose the risk of " losing body fluids , " exposing health hazards . 
These arguments should not be disregarded but seem to pose only small obstacles rather than insurmountable walls . 
<PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> stated that if a person were only mildly intoxicated an officer likely would not know . 
He went on to say the way an officer responds to any student suspected of being intoxicated depends on the circumstances . 
If a student does not seem capable of taking care of him or herself , for example , the student will be taken to the hospital or arrested . 
It seems as if a taboo intoxication level exists where intoxication past this point means students can not take SafeRide . 
But the line can not be drawn clearly . 
As <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> himself noted , officers are not exactly smelling students ' breath . 
Officers have little to go by to determine if a person is intoxicated . 
Different officers will respond to the same student differently , likely based on their feelings toward alcohol . 
Because students are unsure if they will be accepted or turned down , they are deterred from even calling SafeRide . 
This will be the case even if the student is far from " losing body fluids " and would provide no problem in the van . 
There are several ways to offer Safe-Ride to the intoxicated while minimizing the objections <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> brought up . 
Perhaps one step could be to remove police officers from the SafeRide van and hire commercial drivers , as late night buses do . 
These drivers would have the same hesitations in driving intoxicated individuals that officers may have , but may be more accommodating as a group . 
A civilian would feel less responsibility than an officer to punish those that have been drinking . 
These drivers , then , would encourage more students to board in general . 
Furthermore , we can not overlook the fact that students may feel less intimidated to use SafeRide if a police officer were not driving , and thus , use the service more often . 
Yet these commercial drivers would still have the power to remove individuals from the van if they fear the individual would vomit ( making the van temporarily unusable ) , but those removed could be strongly encouraged to call Yellow Cab . 
Likewise , if students ( drunk or sober ) distract the driver , they could be removed from the van . 
These measures would control distracting behavior or vomiting that <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> alluded to , but would allow SafeRide to serve intoxicated students far more frequently . 
At many colleges across the country , equivalents of SafeRide can be found serving all students , regardless if they had been drinking or not . 
Recognizing that student safety takes the greatest priority , the service overlooks what state the student may be in . 
These universities have wisely realized that it seems far more likely for a young , intoxicated woman to be raped while walking home than for an intoxicated rider to distract the driver and cause a collision . 
It will be a matter of time -- and increasing numbers of sexual assault victims -- before our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> reaches the same conclusion .
