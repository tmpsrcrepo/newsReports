The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily Delegate Robert Bell</ORGANIZATION> is confident the policy will help prevent sexual assault The <ORGANIZATION>Virginia House of Delegates and Senate</ORGANIZATION> unanimously passed two identical bills <DATE>Friday</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>House Bill</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>1930</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Bill 712 , addressing the issue of sexual assault on college campuses . 
The bills will be passed to Gov. <PERSON>Terry McAuliffe</PERSON> to be signed into law . 
The legislation ensures survivors have access to information about their options and support services , and establishes a procedure for handling charges of sexual assault . 
The bills require university employees to report acts of sexual violence to the campus Title IX coordinator , who will in turn report the information to a committee comprised of the coordinator , a law enforcement representative and a student affairs representative . 
The team will meet within 72 hours after receiving the information to determine if immediate disclosure to law enforcement is necessary to protect the survivor or the public . 
In cases involving felony sexual assault , the team will notify the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> 's Attorney . 
Del . 
<PERSON>Robert Bell</PERSON> , R-Piedmont , the sponsor of HB <DATE>1930</DATE> , said he believes the provisions will successfully combat sexual violence . 
" The goal was to protect a sexual assault victim and to prevent future victims , " <PERSON>Bell</PERSON> said . 
" Within the parameters allowed by federal law , I believe this bill does a good job of meeting its goals . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> bill initially required campus employees to report allegations of sexual assault to the police . 
This stipulation was modified after it drew criticism from advocacy groups who thought it violated survivors ' rights to confidentiality and would discourage them from reporting their attacks . 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Win Jordan</PERSON> , a member of the all-male sexual assault peer education group One in Four , participated in a lobbying effort to remove the mandatory reporting component . 
" We felt like that would really stifle survivors from coming forward if they could n't fully trust who they were confiding in , " <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> sexual assault awareness project coordinator , also said she prefers the legislation in its present form . 
" As someone who is a survivor and comes from advocacy background , I was weary of the bill 's initial treatment of survivors as lacking agency , " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said . 
" It was almost paternalistic and patronizing . 
This current system is trying to strike a balance and preserve autonomy . " 
Under the legislation , survivors of sexual assault can choose how much information to share with the threat assessment committee and how they would like to participate in the process . 
Even in cases where the team decides to take action against the alleged assailant or notify law enforcement based on factors in the report that involve risks to community safety , such as repeat offenders and misconduct perpetrated with a weapon or involving drugs and alcohol , there is no requirement for survivors to take part in the disciplinary process . 
<PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said she believes the new procedure will ultimately lead to increased reporting . 
" We may see an initial decline in reporting as tends to happen when policies are adjusted , but I would hope in the long-run to see more reporting once people get a better feel of how much control they have , " <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said .
