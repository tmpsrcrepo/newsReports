It looks like the <ORGANIZATION>National Organization for Women</ORGANIZATION> ( NOW ) has let its whole staff out on <DATE>summer</DATE> vacation . 
That , or they 're hypocrites . 
Those are the only two possible explanations for their deafening silence in the case of Rep. <PERSON>Gary Condit</PERSON> ( D-Calif . ) 
. 
Condit , a married congressman , slept with a young intern and misled police after she disappeared without a trace . 
You 'd expect the feminist groups to be the first to take up arms . 
But then you 'd be overlooking the fact that <PERSON>Condit</PERSON> is a Democratic congressman . 
A search for " Condit " on the NOW web site ( www.now.org ) came up with nothing about the missing intern . 
Looking for <ORGANIZATION>Chandra Levy</ORGANIZATION> in Ms. Magazine ? 
Do n't hold your breath ; there has n't been one article about the incident . 
Searching " recent news " on feminist.com gives no matches on the Condit affair , although more than half of the articles explicitly criticize President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> . 
<PERSON>Gloria Jacobs</PERSON> , the editor of Ms. <PERSON>Magazine</PERSON> , compares this to a matter of choice . 
On The O'Reilly Factor , a political talk show , she says , " I think the idea is that what feminism always wanted for women is the right to choose their partners , their own sexuality , whether they 're young women or older women . " 
And what is her main defense of Condit ? 
" Everybody makes their own choices . " 
<PERSON>Gary Condit</PERSON> 's actions are the same as those of a boss who engages in sex with an employee . 
Reasonable people can disagree on the moral standards we have in the workplace , especially in such a public office as <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> . 
But there is something to be said for consistency in ethical charges against political figures . 
The morality of Mr. <PERSON>Condit</PERSON> 's actions aside , the double standard of feminists has been painfully evident in recent scandals . 
Not surprisingly , Republicans have been demonized , while the Democrats are spared the wrath of the feminists . 
Take the Anita Hill situation in <DATE>1991</DATE> . 
Feminists were quick to use her allegations as fodder to oppose the nomination of <PERSON>Clarence Thomas</PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> . 
And , of course , the fact that <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> was a staunch opponent of abortion did n't impede the feminists . 
Similarly , when <PERSON>Packwood</PERSON> was accused of sexual harassment and the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Ethics Committee</ORGANIZATION> refused to make their hearings public , NOW President <PERSON>Patricia Ireland</PERSON> charged , " Republicans are in a conspiracy with <PERSON>Packwood</PERSON> to shift the blame for his unethical , immoral actions to the women . " 
When <PERSON>James Carville</PERSON> , an advisor to then-President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> , branded <PERSON>Paula Jones</PERSON> as " trailer park trash , " the feminists did n't see fit to use the same tone . 
" In this case , the sexual past of both parties ought to be irrelevant unless directly related to Ms. <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> ' allegations , " said <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> in a NOW press release . 
That was n't all . 
Ireland added , " We invite President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> , Ms. <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> and their supporters to help us change public policy so that no woman ... ever has to face the kind of ruthless attacks we have seen used against <ORGANIZATION>Anita Hill</ORGANIZATION> and countless other women seeking justice . " 
When confronted with a Democrat guilty of sexual misbehavior , feminists seem to need to bring up an example where a Republican has done the same thing . 
This is another distressing example of feminist politics coming before principles . 
Now that the <PERSON>Condit</PERSON> affair has made news , feminists are treating it like the plague . 
And those who do speak out in defense of Condit are quick to scatter the blame across the aisle . 
<PERSON>Eleanor Clift</PERSON> , on The Edge with <PERSON>Paula Zahn</PERSON> , said " Congressman <PERSON>Condit</PERSON> , so far , is guilty of having extramarital affairs , and that is something that a number of congressmen are probably familiar with . " 
This echoes many feminists , who assert that behavior like this is permissible because everyone in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> is doing it . 
If the feminists believe that <PERSON>Condit</PERSON> 's actions are wrong , then they have a responsibility of principle to speak out . 
If they believe that this behavior is acceptable , then they have the responsibility to be consistent in the application of their morals . 
If <PERSON>Condit</PERSON> were a Republican , you can be sure that <LOCATION>Patricia Ireland</LOCATION> would be clamoring for the nearest camera . 
Feminists certainly are not the type to reserve their comments about Republican philanderers and chauvinists . 
Their silence in regard to the Condit scandal all too clearly shows the ideals of feminism have become expendable when outweighed by political gain . 
As a Democrat , it 's disappointing to see a congressman from my party embroiled in such a scandal and crippled politically . 
But it 's even more disappointing to see the ideals of such a noble philosophy as feminism compromised to serve a political purpose .
