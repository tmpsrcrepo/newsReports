At <ORGANIZATION>Central Piedmont Community College</ORGANIZATION> , a transgender student was questioned by security officers on her way into the women 's bathroom and subsequently escorted off the campus . 
The incident has prompted the <ORGANIZATION>Freedom Center for Social Justice</ORGANIZATION> to threaten to file a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> if the college does not change its policies regarding use of gendered facilities . 
<PERSON>Jeff Lowrance</PERSON> , a spokesman for the college , said the school 's current policy is that students can use bathrooms which match their gender identity at their time of enrollment or use a gender neutral bathroom , but there are few of these available . 
Lowrance also defended the college 's handling of this particular situation , claiming it was " simply a case of our security officer who did n't want to allow a male into the female bathroom , " as cited in Inside Higher Ed . 
But both the college 's policy and its handling of the situation do not create an accepting and safe atmosphere for transgender students . 
The policy that students must use a bathroom consistent with their gender identity when they enroll ignores the possibility that students may decide to transition after they enroll in college . 
To mandate that these students continue to use facilities which now do not fit their gender identity denies them a significant degree of personal autonomy . 
Ideally , universities should have as many gender neutral facilities as possible . 
Some students may not feel comfortable identifying as either gender , and institutions should be structured so that they accept this decision not to identify , as well as the decision to change identifiers . 
As an example of an initiative to accommodate transgender students , Coordinator of <ORGANIZATION>LGBTQ Student Services</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>the University Scott Rheinheimer</ORGANIZATION> has campaigned to make a list of gender neutral bathrooms around Grounds , and post the list the online so students know where they can find them . 
Additionally , on <DATE>Monday the 31st of March</DATE> , the LGBTQ Center hosted a panel on Trans * Visibility . 
<ORGANIZATION>Central Piedmont Community College</ORGANIZATION> 's handling of this particular incident exacerbates their policies which already do not accommodate the needs of transgender or gender fluid students . 
Lowrance portrayed the security officer 's acts as appropriate , like she was responding to a potential threat - a man dressed in women 's clothing entering a women 's bathroom . 
But simply not conforming to gender norms is not grounds for this kind of suspicion , and escorting the student completely off the campus was a gross overreaction to what should be a mundane , routine act - using a restroom . 
Many transgender students already face bullying and harassment . 
A <DATE>2010</DATE> study found that <PERCENT>38 percent</PERCENT> of transgender students , faculty and staff have thought about leaving their institutions " because of the challenging climate . " 
Being escorted off a campus by security officers , which occurred in this case , may amplify these concerns , as anyone who witnessed the event may associate the student with deviant , shameful or even dangerous behavior . 
All students should be able to feel safe on their college campuses . 
But profiling students like the security officers did in this case will only instill fear in transgender students . 
The same <DATE>2010</DATE> study found <PERCENT>43 percent</PERCENT> of transgender students , faculty and staff " feared for their physical safety . " 
Colleges should attend to the needs of transgender students by changing their policies to allow for gender fluidity and flexibility with identification , and by training their staff to respond appropriately to situations like these . 
In this particular case , the right response would have been no response at all .
