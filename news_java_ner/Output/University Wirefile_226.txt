A seventh known attack genetically linked to a serial rapist operating in the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> area has prompted <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> and local police to increase their public awareness efforts and encourage public assistance in the ongoing investigation . 
The latest attack occurred <DATE>Aug. 18</DATE> around <TIME>3:15 p.m.</TIME> on <ORGANIZATION>Webland Drive</ORGANIZATION> , located off of Hydraulic Road . 
According to an <LOCATION>Albemarle County</LOCATION> police report , a woman arrived at her house and discovered the suspect inside her home . 
The attacker knocked her to the ground , sexually assaulted her and fled on foot . 
The suspect most likely gained access to the house by breaking in through a rear door , the report says . 
The recent incident has been forensically linked to six other sexual assault cases that occurred in the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> since <DATE>1997</DATE> . 
Of the seven attacks , one occurred on <ORGANIZATION>University Grounds</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Lambeth Field</ORGANIZATION> . 
In that <DATE>May 2000</DATE> incident , a female student resisted the attacker and forced him to flee the area , <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Michael Coleman</PERSON> said . 
Last week , the joint task force of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Albemarle County</LOCATION> police distributed updated fact sheets on the rape suspect throughout the community . 
The fliers outline characteristics of the man , encourage people to be cautious and aware of their surroundings , and offer a <MONEY>$ 20,000</MONEY> reward for information leading to his arrest . 
The fliers describe the suspect as a black male of athletic build , between 5-foot-6 and 6 feet tall . 
His eyes are described as large and extremely white . 
The flier says the suspect has " extreme comfort in and around the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> area . " 
" He 's probably living in this area , is what we believe , " <ORGANIZATION>Albemarle County Police</ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON>G. A. Jenkins</PERSON> said . 
" As the two police chiefs said , they believe this individual is among our citizens . 
He may hold a job in our community , and he may work alongside any one of us . 
This guy is a pretty smart guy , we think . " 
Absent from the new fliers is the widely-circulated sketch of the suspect that appeared in last year 's material . 
<PERSON>Jenkins</PERSON> said the sketch was not distributed because it may limit reported information . 
" We 're not excluding the sketch , but we do n't want the community just focusing on that sketch , " <PERSON>Jenkins</PERSON> said . 
" It may limit the information coming in to us . 
We want any info coming in that 's pertinent to this case . " 
Police recommend that citizens lock all residential doors and windows , avoid walking alone and remain alert at all times . 
" At this point , we do n't think anything [ for safety ] is too bizarre , " <PERSON>Jenkins</PERSON> said . 
" Desperate times call for desperate measures , and we want our citizens to be safe . " 
<PERSON>Jenkins</PERSON> said he has received calls from <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students about suspicious behavior and possible suspects . 
" One young lady called me on my cell phone at home the other day , " <PERSON>Jenkins</PERSON> said . 
" The students are very aware , and they 're giving us a lot of information -- and we want it to keep coming in . " 
People can report incidences by phone or e-mail , and the task force is setting up a toll-free number that will connect callers directly to a detective on the case , <PERSON>Jenkins</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said the department would like to receive even more calls and emphasized the importance of public assistance in solving this case . 
" This case is probably going to be solved by information that comes from the public , " <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> said . 
" We encourage anyone that might have any information to contact us . 
It 's just really important . "
