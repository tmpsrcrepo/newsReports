Six former Medical Center employees filed a lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> claiming their rights of due process were violated when they were abruptly fired <DATE>May 29</DATE> . 
The firings came after a patient care assistant in the psychiatric ward , <PERSON>Rudolph T. Johnson Jr.</PERSON> , was arrested <DATE>May 15</DATE> for allegedly raping a patient the night before . 
Johnson had been hired with a known criminal record of drug use . 
It was later discovered that the <DATE>May 15</DATE> arrest came two weeks after <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> police began investigating <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> in connection with a late <DATE>April</DATE> rape complaint that came from the same ward . 
The hospital has since decided to fire all employees who had been working six months or less and had been convicted of felonies in the past . 
Johnson has since been charged with the <DATE>April</DATE> rape . 
The six workers who were fired are now filing suit because the hospital had no official rules concerning hiring employees with felony convictions . 
The suit claims that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> changed the conditions of employment after hiring the six plaintiffs , a violation of due process rights . 
The plaintiffs are demanding to be reinstated at their old jobs with back pay . 
<PERSON>Mary Smith</PERSON> , one of the former employees who filed the suit , said her supervisor told her she was getting fired from her position as a receptionist because of <ORGANIZATION>Johnson</ORGANIZATION> 's arrest . 
" I do n't think it was right , especially when [ the rape allegations ] had nothing to do with us , " <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> was convicted of forgery and writing bad checks in <DATE>1996</DATE> . 
" I loved my job and I enjoyed the people I worked with , " she said . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Labor Action Group</ORGANIZATION> , an organization of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> staff , students and faculty and <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> residents , has become involved with the plaintiffs ' fight for reinstatement and helped stage a protest in front of the hospital <DATE>Friday</DATE> . 
Originally , the Medical Center fired nine employees because of prior felony convictions . 
But it then rehired three based on the nature of the individual convictions and whether the convictions were disclosed on their job applications . 
The fired employees were all " probationary " because they had been hired in the <DATE>last six months</DATE> . 
Non-probationary employees who had felony convictions were not fired . 
As of <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> , the lawsuit had not yet been served to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> officials , so they had no comment on the allegations made by the six plaintiffs . 
In addition to being sued , the hospital has also been placed on " double-jeopardy " status by the <ORGANIZATION>Health Care Financing Administration</ORGANIZATION> , the federal agency that administers the Medicare program . 
The sexual assault allegations prompted this action , as well as the <DATE>August</DATE> discovery by the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Department of Health</ORGANIZATION> of improper use of restraints in the psychiatric ward . 
" We are deeply disturbed by the situations that have occurred , " <PERSON>Leonard W. Sandridge</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> executive vice president and chief operating officer said . 
University police would not comment if the rape victims were restrained during the alleged attacks . 
University officials took a number of actions last week to improve their status with <ORGANIZATION>HCFA</ORGANIZATION> , including adding a policy that any employee accused of serious misconduct will immediatly be reassigned or suspended . 
Officials are confident that when <ORGANIZATION>HCFA</ORGANIZATION> re-inspects the hospital in three to six weeks , the double jeopardy status will be lifted .
