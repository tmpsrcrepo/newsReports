Mallory Noe-Payne | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily The University</ORGANIZATION> released its proposal for a new sexual misconduct policy <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> - the latest revision since <DATE>2011</DATE> - in response to recently increased federal pressure to clamp down on sexual violence . 
The proposal is open for public commentary until <DATE>Dec. 5</DATE> . 
The updated policy more explicitly defines the channels through which victims can respond to sexual assault , expands the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's definition of sexual assault and modifies the judicial and reporting procedures related to circumstances of misconduct . 
In a news release published <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> said the proposed changes come out of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Education 's Office of Civil Rights</ORGANIZATION> modifications of the <ORGANIZATION>Clery Act</ORGANIZATION> , which require universities to disclose information related to sexual assault incidents on their campuses . 
The changes take effect <DATE>July 1 , 2015</DATE> . 
Much of the proposed modifications to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's current policy serves as clarification of existing procedures and elucidation of potential actions students and <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> bodies can take in a case of sexual misconduct . 
" The Proposed New Policy is significantly longer than the current policy , which is focused almost exclusively on the procedures for resolving student disciplinary complaints , " the release read . 
" Consistent with new federal guidance , the Proposed New Policy outlines all of a student 's options following an incident of <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct</ORGANIZATION> , including how to obtain immediate and ongoing support and assistance , how to report an incident to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and/or to <ORGANIZATION>Police</ORGANIZATION> , and how to file a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> complaint . " 
The policy also offers expanded definitions for various terms , including intimate partner violence , domestic violence and stalking . 
" The Proposed New Policy adopts the definitions contained in the Clery Act , as amended by [ the Violence Against Women Act ] , " the press release said . 
The policy also establishes new means through which students are able to report acts of sexual violence . 
" Students may now report Sexual Misconduct via an online system ( Just Report It ) or they may report by disclosing information about Sexual Misconduct to any ' Responsible Employee , ' " the release said . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> adopted a new reporting policy on <DATE>August 25 , 2014</DATE> , requiring all ' Responsible Employees ' to report student disclosures of Sexual Misconduct to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's Title IX Coordinator . " 
Other significant changes in the new proposal move to modify how the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> responds to sexual assault - limiting the scope of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> to conducting hearings . 
The policy also requires suspension or expulsion be considered in each case heard by the <ORGANIZATION>SMB</ORGANIZATION> . 
Prevention efforts also play a larger role in the new policy , with descriptions of " training , education and prevention programs offered to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students , faculty , and staff , " the release said . 
<PERSON>Emily Renda</PERSON> , project coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION>University Student Affairs Office</ORGANIZATION> , said the new program will include much greater focus on student outreach and encouraging students to report instances of sexual assault . 
" Right now we 're dealing with an administrative culture and a peer culture in some ways that discourages early reporting , " she said . 
" I do n't think that anybody actively discourages reporting [ but ] it 's more that there are a lot of misconceptions about the system . " 
Ultimately , <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> said hopes the policy will spark dialogue about the issue of sexual assault among students . 
" I 'm hoping that people take the opportunity to look at the policy and actually dig into it , " said <PERSON>Renda</PERSON> . 
" This is a really important opportunity for students to start engaging with the policy . "
