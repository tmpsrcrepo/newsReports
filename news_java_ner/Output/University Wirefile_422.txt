The Z Society is pleased to announce that <PERSON>Nicole Eramo</PERSON> , associate dean of students , has received the Pale Z Award . 
The Pale Z Award is the highest and rarest honor that the Z Society can bestow . 
Our Society commends Ms. <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> for her work supporting students whose lives have been affected by sexual violence . 
One of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's most dedicated servants , Ms. <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> stands in the company of <PERSON>Ernest Mead</PERSON> , <PERSON>Pat Lampkin</PERSON> , and <PERSON>John Casteen</PERSON> - also recipients of the Pale Z . 
This week , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> acknowledges the destructive effects of sexual violence . 
Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night Week</ORGANIZATION> comes on the heels of much serious conversation about sexual misconduct on college campuses , including a two-day conference that brought together representatives from multiple institutions . 
It is difficult for colleges to respond to sexual violence cases . 
Administrators such as Ms. <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> are caught in a complex tangle of confidentiality rules and legislation - from Title IX to due process requirements . 
The process of adjudicating sexual misconduct cases can be frustrating and intimidating . 
We recognize criticisms of this process . 
But Ms. <PERSON>Eramo</PERSON> , despite working within the confines of an imperfect system , has proved herself a tireless advocate for students . 
She deserves our gratitude . 
The Z Society thanks her for her efforts .
