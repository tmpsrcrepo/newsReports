Wikipedia | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily Jameis Winston</ORGANIZATION> continues to play despite a checkered past at <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> . 
If Winston was a Cavalier , columnist <ORGANIZATION>Chanhong Luu</ORGANIZATION> writes , he would n't be in the active lineup right now . 
English is my dad 's second language , so throughout Fall Break he would see reports on <ORGANIZATION>ESPN</ORGANIZATION> about <PERSON>Jameis Winston</PERSON> , but he did n't know what they were about . 
He asked me what Winston had done this time and wondered whether he was going to be suspended . 
I wondered the same thing , but of all the " Developing Stories " and red-highlighted text on Sportscenter , nothing mentioned a suspension of the <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> quarterback . 
The school is investigating an alleged sexual assault in <DATE>2012</DATE> and more recent news that <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> had signed autographs for money . 
As a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student committed to the Honor Code and a longtime Cavalier sports fan who has seen her fair share of player dismissals , it seems odd to me that Winston would continue playing despite his troubled past and the new allegations against him . 
Winston redshirted his freshman year of college football . 
As a result , he was quite quiet on the field , but the same could n't be said about his off-the-field life . 
In <DATE>November</DATE> of that year , Winston and his teammate <PERSON>Chris Casher</PERSON> were handcuffed by police on campus for shooting squirrels with a pellet gun . 
They were released , and no charges were filed against them . 
<TIME>Later that night</TIME> , <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> and teammates did more than <MONEY>$ 4,000</MONEY> of damage with a BB - and pellet-gun battle at <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> 's apartment complex . 
A few weeks later , a fellow student accused Winston of rape . 
The police dropped the investigation , but the school is now investigating <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> under the student code of conduct . 
Winston has also been accused of stealing soda and crab legs in <LOCATION>Tallahassee</LOCATION> , and earlier this year <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> jumped on a table on campus and delivered a sexually driven and expletive-fueled one-line speech from a popular internet meme . 
He was originally suspended for just the first half of <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> 's game against Clemson <DATE>Sept. 20</DATE> before the suspension was extended to a full game . 
Winston was not suspended this past weekend against No. 8 <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> for the autograph allegation , despite the fact that <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> running back <PERSON>Todd Gurley</PERSON> was suspended just the week before for the same allegation in connection with the same company . 
When asked by Seminole head coach <PERSON>Jimbo Fisher</PERSON> if he did indeed sign autographs for money , <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> denied the allegation . 
<PERSON>Fisher</PERSON> has repeatedly defended <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> , citing " innocent until proven guilty " as the reason Winston should continue playing . 
This past <DATE>Saturday</DATE> , Winston proved to everyone once again that he was a Heisman-caliber quarterback by leading his team to a comeback win against the Fighting Irish for <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> 's 23rd-straight win . 
After the game , <PERSON>Fisher</PERSON> told Winston to stay humble , " act very passive right here and get people back on your side . " 
Time will tell whether <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> will get people back on his side , whether the allegations against him are true and whether <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> values the athlete side of a student-athlete more than the student side . 
But as a Cavalier watching from the sidelines , the one thing that is clear to me is that <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> would n't have had a chance to redeem himself at <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . 
In <DATE>2008</DATE> , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> quarterback <PERSON>Jameel Sewell</PERSON> was left off the roster because of academic ineligibility . 
Sure , the team struggled , but the school stayed true to its tough academic policy . 
Around the same time , replacement quarterback <PERSON>Peter Lalich</PERSON> was kicked off the team for violating his probation stemming from an alcohol-related arrest . 
In <DATE>2010</DATE> , basketball star <PERSON>Sylven Landesberg</PERSON> was removed from the team for academic reasons . 
But doing the right thing does n't always translate to an automatic loss . 
When men 's lacrosse player <PERSON>George Huguely</PERSON> was charged with 2010 murder of his girlfriend <PERSON>Yeardley Love</PERSON> , a player on the women 's lacrosse team , the men 's team cleaned up its program under the leadership of then-senior Bray Malphrus . 
During the <DATE>2011</DATE> season , <PERSON>Shamel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rhamel Bratton</PERSON> , two of the team 's star players , were suspended and eventually removed from the roster for unknown reasons . 
Without the <PERSON>Bratton</PERSON> twins , the team moved away from a midfield-dominated offense to an attack-led offense spearheaded by <ORGANIZATION>Steele Stanwick</ORGANIZATION> . 
The team had its rough patches , but it went 13-5 on the season . 
Going into the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA Tournament</ORGANIZATION> , no one picked <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> to win , but <LOCATION>Stanwick</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Malphrus</PERSON> and the new offense led the <ORGANIZATION>Cavaliers</ORGANIZATION> to a national championship , their first since <DATE>2006</DATE> . 
Stanwick was later given the award for the best lacrosse player in the country , the Tewaaraton Trophy , even though he did n't score in the title game against <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> . 
More recently , in <DATE>2013</DATE> , quarterback <PERSON>Phillip Sims</PERSON> was thought to be the next savior of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> football after transferring from <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> the previous season . 
But he , too , was removed from the team and school for undisclosed reasons . 
Head coach <PERSON>Mike London</PERSON> had this to say about the incident , putting the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> athletics mission statement into perspective : " The thing we tell the young men who come to the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> to receive a world-class education and play for our football program is pretty simple . 
Go to class . 
Show class and treat people with dignity and respect . 
Those directions are pretty easy to follow and they will lead you on a path of success . 
When an individual strays from those directions , it is very disappointing to me . 
<PERSON>Phillip Sims</PERSON> did not make the commitment he needed to succeed here . " 
I love being a <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Cavalier because the athletes are n't exempt from the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's honor code , and the people involved with the teams emphasize doing the right thing , win or lose .
