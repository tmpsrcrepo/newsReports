Results from a new national study show that about 1,400 college students die every year in alcohol related incidents and another 500,000 are injured . 
The study , released <DATE>last Tuesday</DATE> , was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION>Task Force on College Drinking of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</ORGANIZATION> . 
The study also shows that over 600,000 students are assaulted by other students who have been drinking , and 70,000 are the victims of alcohol related sexual assaults . 
The first year in college and even the first few weeks are the most dangerous times , according to the study , and increased efforts to curb high risk drinking appear to have failed . 
The <ORGANIZATION>NIAAA</ORGANIZATION> study expanded on past analysis that focused on individual deaths and injuries to students who drink . 
It also gathered data on incidents caused by intoxicated students , which increased the overall number of estimated injuries and deaths . 
Reactions to the <ORGANIZATION>NIAAA</ORGANIZATION> study at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> indicated administrators are already well aware of the consequences of drinking , but still remain concerned . 
" We do n't need a study to tell us there is a problem , we have our own stories to confirm that , " Dean of <ORGANIZATION>Students Penny Rue</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" Regardless of how many die , and studies will always quibble over those numbers , it is too many . " 
In order to estimate how many deaths and injuries were related to alcohol , the <ORGANIZATION>NIAAA</ORGANIZATION> used national data from the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ORGANIZATION> and other analyses . 
Because college students make up <PERCENT>31 percent</PERCENT> of all Americans ages 18 to 24 , the <ORGANIZATION>NIAAA</ORGANIZATION> assumed college students would account for <PERCENT>31 percent</PERCENT> of all deaths and injuries in that age range . 
The study also utilized a survey given to students nationwide that showed four out of five college students drink and <PERCENT>31 percent</PERCENT> of college students met accepted standards for alcohol abuse . 
<PERSON>Aaron Laushway</PERSON> , assistant dean of students of fraternity and sorority life , said the numbers worried him . 
But he said he also felt optimistic because recent surveys have shown <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students drink less than they used to and less than they think they actually do . 
" The suggestion the data makes is disturbing -- it shows alcohol plays way too central a role in the lives of students , " <PERSON>Laushway</PERSON> said . 
" However there is encouraging news , and often these kinds of studies tend to belie the good things that are happening , " <PERSON>Laushway</PERSON> said . 
" Students have taken proactive measures to address concerns and to alleviate them . " 
Laushway said he believes such studies help increase community dialogue . 
The <ORGANIZATION>NIAAA</ORGANIZATION> study also discussed potential remedies for problems , almost all of which Rue reported are in use at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We are one of the leaders nationally , " Rue said . 
" We use many programs , like social norming , which is a data driven program to decrease perceptions and downplay peer pressure . " 
Though <PERSON>Rue</PERSON> said she thinks still more could be done to work with the community in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , both she and <PERSON>Laushway</PERSON> said they believe the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> engages in " good coordination . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>NIAAA</ORGANIZATION> study said current anti-drinking policies are ineffective and have done little to reduce high risk drinking among college students .
