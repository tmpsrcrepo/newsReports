THEY 'RE called invisible children . 
They run without shoes -- terrified , tired and often alone -- every evening at dusk as the sky turns bloody red to <LOCATION>Gulu</LOCATION> , the main town located near the Sudanese border in <LOCATION>Northern Uganda</LOCATION> . 
They run from distant villages with only the hope that the family they leave behind each night will be there when they return the following morning , when sunlight shields them from wandering gangs of brutal , murderous militiamen known as the Lord 's <ORGANIZATION>Resistance Army</ORGANIZATION> ( L.R.A. ) . 
While the children run sometimes five miles to the nearest towns , the L.R.A. raids villages indiscriminately : raping , murdering and mutilating those who obscure their deranged path of religious crusade . 
In an article in <DATE>January</DATE> 's Vanity Fair , <PERSON>Christopher Hitchens</PERSON> writes with graphic eloquence of those who ca n't run fast enough . 
The militia 's brutality , he wrote , " has the power to strike the most vivid terror right into the heart and the other viscera . " 
The term " militia " is misleading , however , because the L.R.A. is comprised mostly of children . 
Though perhaps the most disturbing chapter of the story comes as victims appeal to Western intervention , assuming , of course , there was any . 
Each day , ex-Christian fanatic <PERSON>Joseph Kony</PERSON> ( now serving as a sort of deity to his own twisted religion ) enslaves more Acholi children from <LOCATION>Northern Uganda</LOCATION> , roaming the countryside each night in search for more victims and young slaves . 
Kony enslaves the young boys , brutalizes them , then compels them to return to their villages to seek new victims . 
For those too tired or too courageous to comply , he forces the " veteran " boy-soldiers to beat the younger kids , one by one , until only the strongest remain . 
The methods of torture are almost too sickening to publish . 
They remove limbs with dull knives , and disembowel young boys ( many not yet having reached puberty ) with rusty machetes while they are still alive , screaming . 
For the villages they encounter during their nightly raids , the fate is equally grim . 
Kids , who should be attending grade school , remove breasts , lips , ears , and limbs while their victims wail in futile terror . 
Boys rape women with bloodstained machetes . 
At some point , I fear , these descriptions will fade into the largely ignored stories of African wars -- far away , mystifying and unsolvable . 
I wrote last <DATE>October</DATE> about the ongoing genocide in <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> , and even then , descending into the tone of hopeless despair seemed scarily easy . 
Then and now , whenever someone writes of African genocide , desperation often overwhelms any glimmer of hope or , god forbid , a solution . 
And as is so often the case , these two wars sustain and support each other . 
According to the most recent report commissioned by <ORGANIZATION>Human Rights Watch</ORGANIZATION> , the L.R.A. receives material and strategic support from the Sudanese government . 
In exchange , the L.R.A. wages clandestine warfare against the enemies of the government in <LOCATION>Khartoum</LOCATION> . 
When the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> pressures the Sudanese government to slow the genocide ( this happens less frequently that you 'd imagine ) the government simply shifts the burden to <PERSON>Kony</PERSON> and the L.R.A. , who continue the murdering without scrutiny . 
All things considered , the current war in <LOCATION>Uganda</LOCATION> exhibits noticeable dissimilarities to its equally bloody counterpart to the north . 
Unlike the genocidal Janjaweed militias in <LOCATION>Darfur</LOCATION> , which operate as independent cells under intermittent guidance from <LOCATION>Khartoum</LOCATION> , the L.R.A. is the militant wing of <PERSON>Kony</PERSON> 's deranged crusade . 
That is , the entire organization relies upon his charismatic leadership and his tactics of enslaving and indoctrinating child soldiers . 
Arresting him , abducting him , or killing him then seem like obvious strategies . 
Paralyzing <PERSON>Kony</PERSON> 's militias would not only eliminate a tremendous threat to human rights in <LOCATION>Northern Uganda</LOCATION> , it would empower <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> and American negotiators with <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> and most importantly , stabilize a region in desperate need of intervention . 
Without their proxy genocidaires , the Sudanese government and the Janjaweed militias ( arguably the same agent ) lack the transnational capability to wage guerrilla terrorism against civilian populations . 
The conclusion is so apparent , I doubt I need to make the suggestion : Killing or incarcerating <PERSON>Kony</PERSON> , thereby releasing his thousands-strong army of enslaved boys , would save thousands of lives . 
And authorities ought to resist the temptation to grant <PERSON>Kony</PERSON> immunity from <ORGANIZATION>ICC</ORGANIZATION> prosecution for his crimes against humanity . 
While perhaps politically convenient , such criminal negligence would allow one of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> 's most notorious terrorists to permanently escape justice . 
Regardless of your opinions on humanitarian intervention , the opportunity to promote peace and stability while simultaneously dismantling an international terrorist network ought not to pass by unnoticed . 
The consequences of inaction in the case are not that nothing will happen . 
Almost undoubtedly something else , something awful will happen . 
Ignoring this problem tacitly supports terrorist networks in the region and condemns another generation of Ugandan children to an existence that should never be visited on real people .
