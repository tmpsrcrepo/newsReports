The <ORGANIZATION>Virginia House of Delegates</ORGANIZATION> passed two bills <DATE>Monday</DATE> changing current laws regarding human trafficking , an issue that has gained significant traction recently in the state legislature . 
" This is a rapidly growing crime in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , and our goal is to stop it , " said <LOCATION>Del</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Robert Bell</PERSON> , R-Albemarle , who proposed one of the bills . 
" The sex trade is ... an abuse of the young people that are victimized by it , and we want to stop it as soon as we can . " 
The bills passed in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> will serve to clarify the application of current laws regarding trafficking , kidnapping and abduction . 
" Part of the problem is that some law enforcement [ officers ] have difficulty just trying to figure out exactly what laws pertain to traffickers , " said one aide to a Democratic state senator , who asked to remain anonymous . 
" There are laws already on the books for people who engage in kidnapping or abduction , so there are similar statutes that might be related to trafficking , but they 're not all necessarily grouped together in a stand-alone trafficking set . " 
<ORGANIZATION>House Bill 235</ORGANIZATION> , which passed 94-5 , focuses on clarifying the punishment for those engaging in sexual trafficking as customers . 
With the new provisions , those who solicit underage prostitutes , if convicted , will be required to register with the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> sex offender registry . 
The bill also calls for equal punishment for offenders , regardless of whether or not a minor is brought into sexual trafficking willingly . 
" We do n't think it 's a question of whether its against their will or not , " <PERSON>Bell</PERSON> said . 
House Bill 660 , which was passed 92-7 , allows prosecutors of human trafficking cases to seize , and ultimately call for the forfeiture of , assets whose acquisition is traceable to trafficking . 
" It is substantially broader than our current statute that only covers cars and only second offenses , " <PERSON>Bell</PERSON> said . 
Though results in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> do not always predict the outcome of a bill in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> , the recent bicameral support for the human trafficking bills bodes well for the ultimate passage of concrete legislation , the Democratic aide said . 
Sex trafficking is an issue that has similarly received increased attention in the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> area in recent years . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Justice Initiative</ORGANIZATION> , an organization that started up this <DATE>fall</DATE> and is working to raise awareness about human trafficking in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> and the surrounding area , plans to offer programs for victims of human trafficking , residents of the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> area and local law enforcement . 
" We 're working towards the idea of having an in-depth training in police departments so they will know what to be looking for , " said <PERSON>Julia Craig</PERSON> , point person for the organization . 
Though the CJI was not heavily involved in the two recent <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> initiatives , their umbrella organization , the <ORGANIZATION>Richmond Justice Initiative</ORGANIZATION> , was " at the forefront of the two bills , " <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> said . 
The <PERSON>Arbor</PERSON> , an up-and-coming organization that plans to support and provide housing for victims of human trafficking in the area , planned a <DATE>Feb. 3</DATE> awareness event with <ORGANIZATION>Albemarle County Public Schools</ORGANIZATION> which has been rescheduled due to snow . 
Presenters will discuss human trafficking in the region , as well as services the <PERSON>Arbor</PERSON> plans to provide for victims and their families . 
<PERSON>Craig</PERSON> says there are a number of things <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> residents can do to raise awareness about human trafficking on their own . 
" A lot of people do n't even really realize it exists , so just spreading the word about the issue would be one thing , " <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> said . 
" You 're able to anonymously call into the national human trafficking hotline and report a tip , so if you feel like something fishy [ is going on ] , you can report a tip . "
