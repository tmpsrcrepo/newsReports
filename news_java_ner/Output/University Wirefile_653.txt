<PERSON>John Pappas</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily Looking</ORGANIZATION> to the future , <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said he knows both the student body and CAPS are strong enough to continue supporting those who need help . 
In what <ORGANIZATION>Counseling and Psychological Services</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Tim Davis</PERSON> has termed an " all-out blitz , " the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has been aggressively working to reduce suicide risk and build prevention efforts following a difficult fall semester , involving both Counseling and <ORGANIZATION>Psychological Services</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Madison House</ORGANIZATION> in the process . 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said the entire department has been discussing short-term and long-term actions to decrease the suicide risk at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> after a trying fall . 
" Starting in the <DATE>second week of January</DATE> , there have been suicide awareness talks - <DATE>30</DATE> of those in the past five weeks , " <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said . 
" We 've had three large training sessions open to all faculty members . 
We are really sprinting to get the word out . " 
<PERSON>Andrea Iglesias</PERSON> has been hired from the <ORGANIZATION>University of Colorado-Boulder</ORGANIZATION> to fill a new CAPS position , assistant director for outreach . 
In this role , she will focus entirely on suicide prevention and facilitating long-term prevention efforts . 
Even though last semester saw an increase in the risk of student suicide , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is known to low-risk overall , <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said . 
" If we look at to the <DATE>fall</DATE> , we look like we 're in bad shape , but if we look to the 10 year , we are at a very low rate of student suicides , " <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said the heightened risk comes as the culmination of multiple traumatic events . 
" Whenever there is a suicide on campus , then you are at more risk , " <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said . 
" Especially with such a close-knit community and then you mix in <PERSON>Hannah [ Graham</PERSON> ] 's tragedy and the Rolling Stones article . " 
HELP Line , a student hotline run through <ORGANIZATION>Madison House</ORGANIZATION> , also helps to deal with suicide prevention on Grounds , among other issues . 
HELP Line Head Program Director <PERSON>Stephen Giannotti</PERSON> , a fourth-year College student , said there is an extensive procedure to address calls . 
" Suicide is one of the things we train [ for ] , " <PERSON>Giannotti</PERSON> said . 
" If [ callers ] do n't have the means with them we try to get them thinking about something else , give them someone to talk to . " 
Operators are prepared to speak to callers about a broad range of issues , from sexual assault to suicide to questioning one 's sexual orientation . " 
[ Suicide is ] not the only call we exclusively cater to , " <PERSON>Giannotti</PERSON> said . " 
[ We address ] any issue anyone wants to talk about . " 
The hotline is non-directive , so operators do not tell callers what to do . 
Instead , they attempt to provide a listening ear for the caller . " 
[ We 're ] more of a sounding board for [ callers ] , " <PERSON>Giannotti</PERSON> said . 
Although not affiliated with <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , the hotline has made attempts to reach out to the larger <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
" Since we 're a nonprofit , we 're more on our own , " <PERSON>Giannotti</PERSON> said . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has n't really reached out to us [ with suicide prevention efforts ] . " 
<PERSON>Giannotti</PERSON> said they have an outreach team of 10 to 15 people who present appeals to CIOs and student groups around Grounds . " 
[ We appeal to ] anything student led , and we try to reach out to every department , " <PERSON>Giannotti</PERSON> said . " 
[ After the events of last semester ] the E-school reached out to us , [ and we ] did a lot of talks to specific buildings within the E-school last semester . "
