<PERSON>Ryan O'Connor</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily With midterm elections a little more than a month away , the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> campaigns of Democrat Mark <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> , Republican Ed <PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> and Libertarian <PERSON>Robert Sarvis</PERSON> are in full swing . 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> , a former <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> governor and the incumbent , is both running on his record and pushing for several policies unenacted thus far . 
<ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> is also focusing on his bipartisan initiatives , something he says is crucial in a " purple state " like <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . 
" I believe the foundation of good policy is not based on whether you are a Democrat or a Republican , " <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> said in an email . 
" It 's about whether you are solving the problems facing Virginians . 
In <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> I have a long record of working across the aisle to find solutions . 
I am willing to join any gang , group or team that is working towards bipartisan solutions that benefit all Virginians . " 
<PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> , meanwhile , has worked to frame his message in contrast with what many see as the biggest failures of the Democratically-controlled <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> , the son of Irish immigrants and a <LOCATION>Fairfax County</LOCATION> resident , became the first GOP Chairman in 80 years to see his party win majority positions in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> and both houses of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> when he was in charge in <DATE>2004</DATE> . 
The <PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> campaign has developed a five-point agenda for economic growth , or EG2 , based on his belief that economic growth will be achieved through replacing the Affordable Care Act , unleashing American energy , providing tax and regulatory relief , promoting education reform and cutting wasteful spending . 
<PERSON>Sarvis</PERSON> , a former entrepreneur and math teacher as well as a candidate in last year 's governor 's race , is focusing his campaign on problems within the traditional two party system . 
The three candidates have been hard at work mobilizing volunteers . 
While <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> has the advantage of an experienced and proven campaign operation , <PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> is working hard to organize a grassroots campaign with the aid of local communities . 
Dubbed the " G-Force , " the volunteers for his campaign range from young Republicans to veterans . 
<PERSON>Sarvis</PERSON> has also worked hard to build support . 
" We have a small campaigning team , " <PERSON>Sarvis</PERSON> said . 
" We have some local coordinators , some of whom are on campus . 
We run on a lot of volunteers . 
As for funding , we get a lot of donations . 
I self-funded a part of it , but mostly donations from Virginians who have been long-time libertarians . " 
The three candidates are all placing college voters high on their priority lists . 
One of <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> 's biggest campaign pushes has been to make college debt a leading issue , and he has toured colleges around the state , including the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , to promote policies which he says would lighten debt burdens . 
Warner funded his own education at <ORGANIZATION>George Washington University</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Law School</ORGANIZATION> , and often recounts that story to students struggling to pay back debt . 
" We should cap the amount of your monthly bills at <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of your income , providing employers with the option to offer <MONEY>$ 5,000</MONEY> pre-tax to help employees pay off their debt and making the costs and benefits of college more transparent before you apply , " <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> said in an email . 
Also on his tour of college campuses , <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> has stressed the importance of dealing with sexual assault on campuses . 
He introduced the bipartisan Campus Safety and Accountability Act to better protect and empower students against sexual assault as well as strengthen transparency and accountability of educational institutions . 
<PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> said he believes his policies will provide greater opportunities for college graduates and older constituents alike . 
" We do n't have to have an economy where <PERCENT>46 percent</PERCENT> of the newly-graduated workforce are unemployed , " <PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> said . 
" We can have a country where the next generation does better than the one that came before us - but that needs a change in policy . " 
<PERSON>Sarvis</PERSON> has also focused on younger voters , and will speak at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> this <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> . 
" I think young people tend to be more open-minded , " he said , " Sadly , young people are also the worst served - underserved , in fact - by our political system . 
We put the burden of debt on them . 
... We make them pay high taxes to provide for retirees . " 
Now six years since the start of the <DATE>2008</DATE> recession , campaigns are still placing strong focus on improving the economy . 
" I want to fix the anemic economy , " <PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> said . 
" I want to create jobs . 
I want to lift people out of poverty , hold down health care cost and fix the economy ; I think we need to have different policies and a different approach . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> campaign is also prioritizing the role of entrepreneurship as a way to spur economic growth . 
Warner himself was an entrepreneur before entering politics , and is currently the wealthiest member of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We need to provide entrepreneurs with the right tools , like the ability to use crowdfunding to increase access to capital , in order to encourage small businesses to grow , " he said . 
While <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> is in large part running on his record , <PERSON>Sarvis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> have focused on issues they believe will set them apart . 
<PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> has voiced strong support for the <ORGANIZATION>Keystone Pipeline</ORGANIZATION> and opposition of the Affordable Care Act . 
" There is a very clear difference in terms of our policies for this election , " <PERSON>Gillespie</PERSON> said . 
" My policies will ease the squeeze for Virginians and make it easier for the unemployed to find work . " 
<PERSON>Sarvis</PERSON> ' primary concerns have been job growth and the economy , increased personal liberties , reduced militarization of police , and reduced involvement in international affairs . 
<PERSON>Sarvis</PERSON> also supports the legalization of marijuana and increased legal immigration . 
<PERSON>Sarvis</PERSON> admits he falls short of campaign finance , but said feels he compensates with his fact-heavy campaigning . 
" We 're trying to focus on substance , " <PERSON>Sarvis</PERSON> said . 
" Republicans and Democrats [ are ] actually very similar , once you really look at their rhetorics . 
Neither really focus on the issues . " 
Despite the historical disadvantage third party candidates typically see , <PERSON>Sarvis</PERSON> said he remains hopeful . 
" I think this is a great opportunity to vote for someone you actually believe in , who wo n't be a part of the two party system , " he said . 
" We 're putting a lot of pressure on Republicans and Democrats . " 
The election will take place <DATE>Nov. 4</DATE> .
