Last year , I argued that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> needs gender-neutral housing options . 
With about 140 other colleges - including <ORGANIZATION>George Washington University</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>University of Maryland</ORGANIZATION> - offering such options , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> lags far behind others in these inclusive policies . 
It 's now <DATE>one year later</DATE> , and we still lack the option . 
The recent controversy over whether women 's colleges should admit male-to-female transgender applicants ( people born into the male sex but who identify with the female gender ) underscores the growing presence of transgender persons in college communities . 
We need to accommodate such <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students , and a gender-neutral housing option is one of the best ways to do so . 
LGBTQ Americans have seen enormous legal and cultural gains over the past several years . 
Still , transgender rights have lagged behind those of gay and lesbian Americans . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has only a handful of students who are openly transgender-and despite events like Transgender Day of Remembrance ( <DATE>November 20</DATE> ) , they remain a largely invisible group . 
Last <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>Mount Holyoke College</ORGANIZATION> , a women 's college in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> , announced a new admission policy : they will admit transgender women ( again , applicants who identify with the female gender but were born with male genetalia ) . 
Women 's colleges have long admitted women and graduated men ( the policy traditionally stipulates that legal documentation must identify students as female at the time of matriculation ) , but <LOCATION>Mount Holyoke College</LOCATION> - which is one of the prestigious " Seven Sisters " schools - prompts a new level of conversation on this controversial topic . 
The <LOCATION>Holyoke</LOCATION> decision encourages us to think more deeply about how to accommodate transgender students here at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Perhaps the most powerful way to improve the daily life of these students is to allow for mixed-gender housing options . 
Transgender students - who often face discrimination and harassment over their personal appearance , behaviors , or other forms of self-expression - might have a more difficult time expressing their identity in same-sex housing . 
In fact , these arguments are often used in favor of gay and lesbian students ( who constitute a much larger category ) . 
For example , after the high-profile suicide of <ORGANIZATION>Rutgers University</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Tyler Clementi</PERSON> , the school found that subsequent gender-neutral housing helped create a more inclusive environment . 
Given the dorm 's central role in first year social life , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policies that ignore the housing needs and preferences of LGBTQ students are not only neglectful but potentially discriminatory . 
So how would gender-neutral housing look on Grounds ? 
Most dorms would remain exactly the same , with each floor or suite designated to only one sex . 
The gender-neutral option need not involve entire buildings - a simple floor or suite could accommodate interested individuals . 
Gooch-Dillard , with its suite style rooms , seems particularly suitable . 
And of course , this would remain an opt-in process , so no student who desires a traditional same-sex living space would be assigned the gender-neutral option . 
Some students in residence life whom I have spoken to worry that gender-neutral areas might become targets of anti-gay attitudes and marginalization . 
I do not find this convincing . 
Even at our <ORGANIZATION>Southern</ORGANIZATION> , relatively traditional school , attitudes toward the LGBTQ community reflect those of the nation ( i.e. increasing tolerance , particularly among young people ) . 
In fact , the <ORGANIZATION>Day of Silence</ORGANIZATION> ( where students abstain from speech for one day in protest of the bullying faced by LGBTQ individuals ) was initially started by <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students back in <DATE>1996</DATE> before it turned into a national movement . 
Higher education contains too many thriving case studies ( for both limited and universal gender-neutral housing ) to disregard these options with simple hypotheticals . 
I do not ask our university to be radical but merely to adopt the more open and democratic policies of so many of its fellow educational institutions . 
Taking other American colleges as case studies , it 's clear that student action is the typical catalyst for gender-neutral housing . 
" Where is the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> 's gender-neutral housing movement ? " 
I asked in my column last <DATE>November</DATE> . 
I repeat it here with a hope that the recent attention to transgender people might encourage <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students to take action . 
Such policy changes , which harm no one , would mean a great deal to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's small but prominent LGBTQ community .
