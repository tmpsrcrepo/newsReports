The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's athletic recruitment process yesterday received off-the-field attention when the school rescinded its scholarship offer to highly-touted baseball recruit <PERSON>Corey Brown</PERSON> . 
The high school senior , a nationally ranked outfielder , agreed to a deal with prosecutors and on <DATE>Monday</DATE> pled guilty to a felony charge of battery stemming from an incident in which <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> and three other boys repeatedly had sex with a 14-year-old girl in a car . 
In light of <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> 's despicable actions and with the integrity of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> at stake , <LOCATION>U.Va</LOCATION> . 
officials certainly made the correct decision in withdrawing their offer from <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> . 
Allowing <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> to come to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> would have been a serious compromise of the reputation of both the <ORGANIZATION>Athletic Department</ORGANIZATION> and the school itself . 
His crime shows a disgusting disregard for both the law and other people , and inviting <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> to join the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community would have gone against every standard of decency and morality . 
Critics often point out the lowering of certain standards for athletes , but under no circumstances should one of those involve tolerating individuals who have committed violent offenses , especially sexual crimes . 
Just like any other person offered admission to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , athletes have an obligation to abide by a code of conduct that respects the law and everyone around them . 
Had <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> been permitted to enroll , it would have been an affront to the victim , the baseball team and all other law-abiding athletes and students . 
Indeed , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> officials deserve praise for their actions . 
Rescinding <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> 's scholarship offer shows a recognition of not what is necessarily the best for the baseball program but for <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> 's dedication to integrity in athletics and admission . 
Under Coach <PERSON>Brian O'Connor</PERSON> 's first year of leadership , the baseball team has quickly risen in prominence , and its success indicates a bright future . 
A player of <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> 's caliber could have easily contributed to the success of the <ORGANIZATION>Cavaliers</ORGANIZATION> , and realizing that his skill on the diamond is not the only worthy attribute in a team member shows a commendable order of priorities on the part of athletic officials . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's action sets it leagues ahead of its peers . 
Future <ORGANIZATION>ACC member University of Miami</ORGANIZATION> failed to immediately end its agreement with football recruit <PERSON>Willie Williams</PERSON> , after he committed crimes on a recruitment trip that might have violated his probation for a burglary , one offense in a series of many others he was convicted of -- <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> had been arrested 10 times before . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's swift decision in <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> 's instance proves that , unlike some fellow competitors , it is not willing to hesitate in matters that can surrender the high ground on issues of right and wrong . 
An important aspect to consider in this type of situation is what threshold must be crossed in order for a student 's scholarship offer to be rescinded . 
Brown 's mother said <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> found out about the allegations against him in <DATE>September</DATE> , and he signed his letter of intent in <DATE>November</DATE> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> was correct in not being overly hasty to drop the offer when charges were filed , but once a conviction occurs in this type of crime , no student , athlete or not , should be allowed to come to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Yesterday 's announcement by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> affirmed its commitment to ensuring that this community only rewards those who can be expected to respect it in the future . 
Some things are more important than how many victories go in a team 's win column , and admitting <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> into such a prestigious program and school would have made the University the big loser in the end .
