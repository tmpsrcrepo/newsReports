Gender studies has taken on a whole new meaning in a classroom at <ORGANIZATION>Boston College</ORGANIZATION> . 
Recently , <ORGANIZATION>Boston College</ORGANIZATION> professor and feminist philosopher <PERSON>Mary Daly</PERSON> refused to allow two male students to take her course , " Introduction to Feminist Ethics . " 
Daly claims that allowing men in the class would make female students uncomfortable as they talk about and debate sensitive feminist ideas . 
What may seem like a disagreement over academic trivia actually raises interesting questions about how women and men should be viewed as we approach the next millennium . 
Mainstream feminist rhetoric in the <DATE>last decade</DATE> has been characterized by a call for equality in work and social spheres . 
We have seen sexual harassment laws strengthened , progress in wage parity and an infusion of women into positions of power and influence . 
Institutions like the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Military Institute</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Citadel</ORGANIZATION> have opened their doors to women after long histories of single-sex admittance policies . 
What ties these events together is an overarching belief that women are equal to men and that we deserve to have the same opportunities and privileges as our male counterparts . 
It seems both interesting and disturbing , then , that there would still be some kind of support for a policy that encourages the separation of the sexes . 
Particularly troubling is the arena in which this separation takes place . 
The college classroom is a rare environment in which there can be a great give and take of ideas and views . 
Minds can be changed and opinions sharpened through intellectual discourse . 
But that ca n't happen when everyone is n't allowed to participate . 
<ORGANIZATION>Boston College</ORGANIZATION> 's web site says that in " Introduction to Feminist Ethics II , " students " will consider fundamental problems arising from the prevailing patriarchal myths and symbols , and the consequent reduction of women and nature to the status of objects . " 
It sounds like a course that could have a broad appeal . 
After all , it is n't only women who are affected by the changing ideas and policies in our society . 
More than that , however , this class allows students of both sexes to explore ideas and beliefs that perhaps are different from their own . 
One of the students refused admittance to the class is a member of the BC College Republicans , and <PERSON>Daly</PERSON> said she believes he had a political agenda . 
" I 'd rather go on leave than teach with him . 
The last thing he 'd have an interest in is feminist philosophy , " she told <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> ( " Feminist Ethics Course : No Place for Men , " <DATE>Feb. 26</DATE> ) . 
That may be true , but perhaps this student needs the class more than anyone . 
His assumed political agenda may not fit in with <PERSON>Daly</PERSON> 's beliefs , but the addition of a different opinion could only strengthen her teaching . 
This is n't a support group , it 's a class . 
Why not see it as an opportunity to give the student a different perspective ? 
More than the academic pros and cons of the situation , it creates a dangerous model for gender relations . 
We can not in one breath claim women should be seen as equals , allowed to participate in the same activities as men , and in the next express support for all-female classes . 
Women can not be equal on our own terms , when it 's convenient for us . 
If " Introduction to Feminist Ethics " appears on <ORGANIZATION>Boston College</ORGANIZATION> 's course listings , then it must be open to all students , regardless of their sex . 
This is n't the first we 've heard about separating the sexes . 
A few years ago , a girls-only middle school in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> came under attack . 
The principle behind the school 's establishment was similar to <PERSON>Daly</PERSON> 's justification for excluding men from her class . 
In response to studies that claimed boys are called on more than girls , an all-female learning environment was created to foster a more comfortable atmosphere . 
The problems involved in each are equally similar . 
In the real world , men and women must live together . 
We will be each other 's bosses , colleagues , teachers , mentors and friends . 
Isolating each sex from one another , particularly in education , does not create a realistic portrayal of what the world is like . 
More importantly , it deprives each group from getting a complete picture . 
Maybe men and women do need something of their own -- times when they can get together and bond with members of their own sex . 
There is nothing inherently wrong or unfair in that . 
But those times and experiences belong in the social realm -- dinner with your girlfriends or a movie with the guys -- not in the classroom or the workplaces , and not as part of any kind of institutionalized policy . 
In essence , what <PERSON>Daly</PERSON> is saying when she refuses to admit men into her classroom is that they do n't belong ; that they wo n't fit into a female environment ; that the women in her classes wo n't be able to handle the presence of men . 
Her view does not strengthen the position of women . 
It shortchanges both sexes . 
That 's a loss for everyone .
