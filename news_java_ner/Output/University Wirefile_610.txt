Kelsey Grant | The Cavalier Daily Many sorority national headquarters are putting strict measures in place to prevent member participation in this year 's Boys ' Bid Night activities . 
Several chapters have been required to schedule mandatory meetings or social events in lieu of Bid Night activities , in addition to a request from the <ORGANIZATION>National Panhellenic Conference</ORGANIZATION> last week requesting all sororities cancel organized Bid Night activities . 
Many students are pushing back against these additional restrictions - both from individual chapters and the <ORGANIZATION>National Panhellenic Conference</ORGANIZATION> - which functionally mandate the exclusion of sorority women from the annual festivities . 
The restrictions are condemned by some as strengthening gender discrimination , impeding personal liberties and lacking transparency to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> sorority community . 
The <ORGANIZATION>NPC</ORGANIZATION> 's restrictions , sent to sororities with <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> charters on <DATE>Jan. 20</DATE> , was made without consultation from <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> sorority leadership , but it falls within the <ORGANIZATION>NPC</ORGANIZATION> 's authority , said <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Sorority Council</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Allison Palacios</PERSON> , a third-year College student . 
" Each national organization has the capacity to exercise their own sovereign rights over their members , " <PERSON>Palacios</PERSON> said in an email . 
All the same , students wrote and circulated a petition as well as a letter to the <ORGANIZATION>National Panhellenic Conference</ORGANIZATION> and national sororities to voice opposition to the Boys ' Bid Night ban . 
The petition - started by fourth-year College student Story <PERSON>Hinckley</PERSON> , a member of Kappa Alpha Theta - aims to revoke the mandate in support of women 's rights at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Hinckley</PERSON> said the way the <ORGANIZATION>NPC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>ISC</ORGANIZATION> are treating the issue right now will not lead to beneficial change . 
" Instead of correcting issues within the [ <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> ] and fraternities themselves , these issues will be continually addressed indirectly through restrictions on the <ORGANIZATION>NPC</ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION>ISC</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Hinckley</PERSON> said . 
" With the issue of rape and sexual assault on Grounds , women continue to be punished twice . " 
The letter , written by women of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Kappa Delta</ORGANIZATION> chapter , addressed the <ORGANIZATION>NPC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>National</ORGANIZATION> presidents , citing the issue of gender discrimination in the new regulations . 
" Sororities are organizations founded to empower women , " the letter reads . 
" They are , by their very nature , organizations meant to foster strength among their members . 
They are organizations that inherently promote gender equality . 
This mandate is diametrically opposed to the values on which our organizations were founded and continue to uphold . " 
The letter also condemns the choice to exclude <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> sorority women from the formulation of restrictions . 
" Given the current climate surrounding Greek life at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> , it is appropriate and necessary to question the occurrence of Boys ' Bid Night and its value to our community , " the letter reads . 
" What is inappropriate and concerning to us is the compulsory nature of this mandate . 
Not only were none of the chapter leaders consulted , but some 2,000 members of the national sorority chapters at U.Va . 
are expected to comply with this decision . " 
Kappa <ORGANIZATION>Delta</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>National Chapter</ORGANIZATION> is one of the national organizations imposing additional restrictions on the members of its <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter . 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Taylor Enders</PERSON> , former president of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter , noted backlash to the restrictions . 
" On Boys ' Bid Night , no sorority woman is allowed to go to a fraternity , even if they are acting as an individual , " <PERSON>Enders</PERSON> said . 
" Basically , before we have been prevented from planning events as a sorority that involved drinking , but this is the first time , from my understanding , that we have been mandated to do something as individuals . " 
Many fraternity members have voiced opposition as well , claiming the restrictions imply they can not be trusted to behave responsibly . 
Inter-Fraternity Council President <PERSON>Ben Gorman</PERSON> , a third-year College student , said the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> has not been contacted by any sororities but he has seen fraternity frustration mounting . 
" I think fraternity members are frustrated , " <PERSON>Gorman</PERSON> said in an email . 
" Despite supporting , creating and implementing these new [ FOA ] standards of safety , they have been written off as incapable of being responsible individuals without the chance to demonstrate they can hold safe social events . " 
<PERSON>Gorman</PERSON> said disregarding sorority members ' rights has the potential to create backlash throughout the entire Greek community . 
Instead of leading to positive change , the restrictions may bring overall negative consequences . 
" By discrediting the safety initiatives the policy undermines the principle of student self-governance that our University was founded on , " <PERSON>Gorman</PERSON> said . 
" Rather than encourage students to hold themselves accountable for their actions , system-wide bans are often perceived as collective punishment and consequently impede cultural change . " 
<PERSON>Hinckley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gorman</PERSON> called for a sustainable , long-term solution to the issue of safety in the Greek system . 
" If you were to lock someone in a room for two years , odds are that person would remain safe , " <PERSON>Gorman</PERSON> said . 
" But that 's only a Band-Aid solution that assumes people can respect neither themselves nor their peers . " 
Second-year College student <PERSON>Abraham Axler</PERSON> , chair of the representative body and second-year class president , said he is similarly frustrated by national sorority action . 
Axler is sponsoring a <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> resolution which calls on national sorority organizations to allow <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> sorority chapters to decide how to proceed . 
" Be it resolved that the <ORGANIZATION>Student Council of the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> strongly urges <ORGANIZATION>National Sorority Organizations</ORGANIZATION> to affirm the ability of their members to execute their University-approved safety plan before intervening with <ORGANIZATION>National</ORGANIZATION> mandates , " the resolution reads . 
" To respect our principles of trust and student self-governance , by engaging in meaningful dialogue with their U.Va . 
members to create collaborative policies . " 
<PERSON>Axler</PERSON> said he chose to sponsor the bill because of his strong feelings on the issue , which stem from the huge number of constituents impacted by national sorority authority . 
" This matter is urgent as many of our constituents are distraught by both a breach of their self governance and of their restriction of activities on <DATE>Jan. 31</DATE> , " <PERSON>Axler</PERSON> said in an email to <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> . 
" This is a time where we need to be responsive to our constituents . " 
Council will vote on the resolution in a special session <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> at <TIME>7:45 p.m.</TIME>
