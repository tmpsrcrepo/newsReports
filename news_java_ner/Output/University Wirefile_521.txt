In recent days , faculty and students have gathered in a variety of settings to discuss sexual violence in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
According to recent research , this discussion could prove positive for survivors , who research shows may gain long-term benefits from talking to others about their experiences . 
Psychological research has focused heavily on the importance of communication as well as intervention in optimizing mental health outcomes for rape survivors . 
" A number of intervention programs tailored for women focus on identifying and ameliorating risk factors associated with increased likelihood of sexual assault , " wrote Dr. <PERSON>N. Dickon Reppucci</PERSON> , a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> psychology professor . 
Reppucci is one of three authors of the study , " Social , <ORGANIZATION>Community</ORGANIZATION> , and Preventive Interventions . " 
This study found that such programs yielded observable post-intervention changes for survivors . 
At six months post-intervention , female participants reported more positive lives , defined by less depression , fear and anxiety . 
Third-year <PERSON>Batten</PERSON> student <PERSON>Sarah Jameel</PERSON> , a member of the <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Islamic Student Association</ORGANIZATION> who helped organize a rally against sexual violence <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , said communication may help to prevent and ameliorate the effects of sexual violence . 
" Maybe organizations could utilize their big and little sibs systems not just to strengthen bonds for the social and academic scene , but also for safety , health , and all the other stuff that goes into looking out for each other , " <PERSON>Jameel</PERSON> said . 
" Maybe sibs can point out what you do in these kinds of situations . " 
Faculty members advocate similar initiatives to prevent and address sexual violence on Grounds . 
" It seems to me that encouraging strong connections between older and younger college women may be a huge help because older women are a real resource for the first-year women , " English Prof. <PERSON>Katharine Maus</PERSON> said . 
A <DATE>2010</DATE> study at <ORGANIZATION>the University of South Carolina</ORGANIZATION> found <PERCENT>52 percent</PERCENT> of undergraduate students who were raped sought help .
