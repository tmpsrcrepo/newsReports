Last night , author <PERSON>Michael Scarce</PERSON> held a discussion with students concerning male-on-male rape , alerting audience members to the issues male victims face . 
The discussion , which included about 35 students , was based on Scarce 's new book , " Male on Male Rape : The Hidden Toll of Stigma and Shame . " 
The event was sponsored by the Women 's Center , <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Facts and Education</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> department and the Lesbian , Gay , <ORGANIZATION>Bisexual and Transgender Union</ORGANIZATION> . 
Scarce said it is " fairly rare to hear of men being raped ... You only hear of the weird scenarios , like in the movie ' Deliverance . ' " 
He said stereotypes , such as those formed in that movie and in American culture , are the biggest obstacle that male victims of rape face . 
" The number one issue of stigma that male survivors face is that of homophobia , " he added . 
It makes it difficult for survivors " to get the kind of support and services they need . " 
In addition to stereotypes , male victims of rape face some problems that female victims do not . 
" Male survivors have higher levels of anger and frustration , " Scarce said . 
" Quite often survivors , especially heterosexuals , will question their sexual orientation afterwards . " 
Even when a male rape victim comes forward to seek help , there are often no services provided because organizations for female rape victims are often not trained or equipped to deal with male rape victims and their problems . 
He said about 5 to <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of all sexual assault victims are male , and most of those assaults involve members of the same sex . 
Oftentimes , male rape victims face difficulties even in the legal realm . 
Laws concerning rape vary by state and often are gender-specific -- for instance , defining rape as committed by a male against a female . 
Often , only sodomy laws are applicable in male-male rape cases . 
Scarce , who formerly served as the coordinator of rape prevention at <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State University</ORGANIZATION> and became involved as an <ORGANIZATION>OSU</ORGANIZATION> student with lesbian/gay student groups . 
His new book is the only book to deal with male-male rape . 
Sexual Assault Education Coordinator <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> said she first saw Scarce at various events around the state concerning rape survivors and sexual assault last year . 
" I was very impressed with his speaking skills when I first saw him , and was glad to get him to speak here , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said .
