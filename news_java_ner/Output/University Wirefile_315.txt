This month <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> is participating in the pilot project of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's first campaign to address dating violence on college campuses . 
The project , known as the Red Flag Campaign , was created by the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Sexual and Domestic Violence Alliance</ORGANIZATION> in association with college groups around the state , said <PERSON>Kate McCord</PERSON> , public awareness manager for the <ORGANIZATION>Alliance</ORGANIZATION> and co-coordinator of the campaign . 
" We are a statewide coalition of individuals and agencies working to respond to and prevent sexual and domestic violence , " <PERSON>McCord</PERSON> said . 
" U.Va . 
has been involved from the beginning of the campaign planning process as a member of the advisory committee . " 
The program centers on the distribution of six informative posters and a Web site , <PERSON>McCord</PERSON> said . 
" The posters cover such things as emotional abuse , coercion , sexual assault and isolation , " <PERSON>McCord</PERSON> said . 
" Along with the posters we have a Web site that acts as a resource for students and other campus personnel who are interested in gaining more information about dating violence and how to intervene for a friend . " 
According to <ORGANIZATION>McCord</ORGANIZATION> , the Alliance ran focus groups with students to identify student thoughts on dating violence as well as to compile information for the text of the poster . 
" Most said they would want to intervene for a friend that is either perpetrating dating violence or being victimized in a relationship , " she said . 
" They [ said they ] would need more information ... so we designed the posters around being very clear what the signs are . " 
Starting <DATE>Oct. 6</DATE> , the posters were hung throughout 10 participating <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> colleges , explained <PERSON>McCord</PERSON> . 
Five hundred red flags were also distributed to five of the 10 pilot schools , as well as a pre-campaign survey , she said . 
" The pilot includes a pre-campaign survey ... to test students ' beliefs on dating violence and their reactions to the campaign material , " she said . " 
The posters can be found around Grounds on academic department message boards , in the libraries and <ORGANIZATION>Student Health</ORGANIZATION> , and they are trying to reach out to the Greek community , said <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , director of <ORGANIZATION>Sexual and Domestic Violence Services</ORGANIZATION> at the Women 's Center and member of the Campaign 's advisory board . 
" My goal with this campaign is to continue to raise awareness within the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , particularly with undergraduates , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
Most students do n't realize that dating violence affects people their own age , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
" The truth is I work with students all the time that are being abused , " she said . 
The pilot survey process ends today , however , posters will continue to run " until we run out , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
The actual campaign will start <DATE>August 2007</DATE> and will spread to 20 other <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> colleges , <PERSON>McCord</PERSON> said . 
" It is intended to reach particularly new students during orientation week , " <PERSON>McCord</PERSON> said . 
" It is unknown how long it will run . "
