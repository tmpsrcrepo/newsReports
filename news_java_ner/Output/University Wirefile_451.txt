The term " student activism " brings to mind the turbulence and chaos of the <DATE>1960s</DATE> . 
I think of the <ORGANIZATION>Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee</ORGANIZATION> , and its heroics in organizing and participating in the marches and sit-ins of the Civil Rights movement . 
I think too of the more than 4.5 million students who went on strike in the aftermath of the <DATE>1970</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Kent State University</ORGANIZATION> shootings . 
It 's hard to forget that the <DATE>1960s</DATE> student activism movement was tinged with connotations of rampant drug use and sexual upheaval , but that is not to take away from the obvious successes of this era 's student activism . 
In contrast , this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's activism scene might appear dead . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is game for one or two good protests a year - the <ORGANIZATION>Black Student Alliance</ORGANIZATION> 's recent rally against police brutality comes to mind , as does the furor following the announced cuts to AccessUVa <DATE>last year</DATE> - but apart from these and some other scattered examples , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has been largely devoid of significant activist movements . 
However , I would actually argue that <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has a very healthy activism scene . 
It is not over the top in the manner of <DATE>1960s</DATE> era <LOCATION>Berkeley</LOCATION> , but it is not frozen by any means . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's love for tradition , its penchant for discussing issues thoroughly before acting , and its brand of selective protest make for a special and practical place for the student activist . 
This relative dearth of activism can be partially explained by this university 's general resistance to change and the power of traditional institutions . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> 's single sanction , though some may argue the Informed Retraction has weakened it , remains intact despite decades of mixed student reactions . 
Greek life , a staple of southern college life for a century and a half , still wields great influence over the student body , despite comprising only about <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of undergraduate students . 
Putting aside institutional continuity , even our social customs are very traditional . 
One glance at the student section at football games , with guys still in ties and girls still in pearls , proves that this is a place where old traditions die long and slow deaths , and often seem like they will live forever . 
With this in mind , where can the student activist fit in ? 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's reverence of its traditions and institutions is a blessing to its students in many ways . 
The Honor system does , for all its faults , encourage an academic and social atmosphere where students feel much more trust in their peers than at other institutions . 
The Greek system , for all of its respective faults , adds a valuable component to - but does not completely dominate - the social scene . 
Undoubtedly , both the Honor system and the Greek system have their shortcomings . 
But because of these organizations ' ( and other similarly revered institutions , such as the <ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> ) long history of service to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , the student activist must not create upheaval for the sake of upheaval . 
The student activist must be prudent in his or her push for change by pushing for concrete achievements , such as when the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> advocated for its Restore the Ideal Act in the <DATE>spring of 2013</DATE> . 
It is crucial for the student activist to take the temperature of the student body before pushing for change . 
With this in mind , organizations such as Sustained Dialogue , which debate and discuss issues of importance to this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and the larger world , are a critical resource . 
I often hear , anecdotally , frustration with organizations such as Sustained Dialogue because they are based in discussion , and not action . 
To these complainers , I would remind them that movements with no basis in intellectual thought or discourse rarely succeed . 
The student activist may throw caution to the wind in the event of a clear moral dilemma , along the lines of <PERSON>Jim Crow</PERSON> segregation . 
But does an analogous dilemma exist today ? 
It is difficult to say . 
The closest comparison would likely be the movement to eliminate sexual assault from college campuses . 
Everyone agrees that sexual assault is wrong , and so the current rush to speak out against sexual assault is in many ways a wonderful development ( whether or not it may lead to wanton accusations and the trampling of due process rights is an issue for another day ) . 
The current movement of sexual assault awareness seems a striking example of selective activism near its best . 
And so when a clear moral dilemma arises , the student activist has a duty to respond accordingly . 
All of this is to say that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> actually provides a very healthy climate for student activism . 
Our reverence for tradition , combined with a thorough examination of issues and a keen sense of when to act , gives this <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> the confidence to uphold the traditions that make it great and the strength to change them when necessary .
