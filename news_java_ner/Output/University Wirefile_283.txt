On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> will hear arguments regarding a rarely enforced law in <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> requiring minors to notify a parent 48 hours before an abortion is performed . 
In <DATE>October</DATE> , this page applauded <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> 's efforts to pass similar laws . 
Now we call for <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> to uphold and rule that <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> 's enforces the law . 
Parents should be a source of wisdom and guidance in an adolescent 's life , especially when dealing with such life-changing decisions as abortion . 
It is the belief of the editorial board that it is generally in a young girl 's best interest to notify her parents when seeking an abortion - and that notification should be required by law . 
Some will try and turn the <LOCATION>New Hamphire</LOCATION> case into a pro- or anti-abortion issue . 
That is not what is at stake . 
In an age when we recognize the parents ' responsiblity in crimes committed by their minor children , we also must demand that parents provide support and guidance when their children make a decision about abortion . 
In response to our previous editorial , we received letters to the editor that said laws such parental notifcation do not allow for cases such as rape and impregnation by the father . 
These cases are a small percentage of minor abortion cases , and should not be a measuring stick for abortion laws . 
When a parent chooses to abuse their child , they forfeit the right to govern their child 's behavior . 
In such cases , the welfare of the victim should supersede the rights of a parent to know what decisions their child is making . 
But these exceptions should not nullify laws that are beneficial and responsibly protect the majority . 
We also are not asking that parents give consent before their child can get an abortion . 
The wisdom and guidance a parent can provide is crucial to their child making a well-informed decision . 
It is ultimately minor 's decision . 
The minor will soon become an adult , and will have to face the results of a decision for or against abortion . 
We must not hide behind the fact that it might be difficult for a child to broach the subject of pregnancy and abortion to their parents . 
This presents the possibility that a child might seek an abortion just to hide the pregnancy from their parents , which is not a valid reason for having an abortion . 
Playing games with life is a lose-lose situation . 
Parents , in the vast majority of cases , provide love and support for their children . 
They feed and clothe them ; they teach them right from wrong . 
In times of turmoil , we should encourage children to seek out their parents ' guidance , not turn away from it .
