<PERSON>Brittany Hsieh</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily Presentations often include chanting , Â   singing , dancing and stepping , but each fraternity or sorority brings their own traditions to the event . 
For black fraternities and sororities , new members are revealed to the public during Â   neophyte presentations . 
The crowd at <ORGANIZATION>New Cabell Hall</ORGANIZATION> erupted into applause and loud cheers as masks were pulled off third-year College student <PERSON>Garrison Ambrose</PERSON> and his line brothers , revealing the new inductees of <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Phi Alpha</ORGANIZATION> fraternity . 
<ORGANIZATION>Alpha Phi Alpha</ORGANIZATION> was the first historically black fraternity this <DATE>spring</DATE> to celebrate its new members in a neophyte presentation last week . " 
[ A neophyte presentation ] marks the culmination of the efforts of the young men who pursue <ORGANIZATION>Omega</ORGANIZATION> , " alumnus and <ORGANIZATION>Omega Psi Phi</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Anthony Onuoha</PERSON> said . 
" It is the culmination of their effort , hard work and sacrifice of time . " 
Most neophyte presentations include chanting of the fraternity 's history and lineage as well as stepping and dancing or singing . 
However , each fraternity brings its own unique traditions to the event . 
For example , <ORGANIZATION>Omega Psi Phi</ORGANIZATION> members pride themselves on having educational and entertaining presentations . 
" Excellence , enthusiasm and methodical precision are expected , " <PERSON>Onuoha</PERSON> said . 
" During a [ presentation ] the expectations are high . 
There should be no mistakes . 
We want people to feel it . 
We want to move the audience . " 
Starting from induction and even afterwards , <ORGANIZATION>Omega</ORGANIZATION> members work as a team to uphold the fraternity 's motto : " Friendship is essential to the soul . " 
Fourth-year <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> student and <ORGANIZATION>Omega Psi</ORGANIZATION> Phi member <PERSON>Cecil White</PERSON> said he was drawn to this fraternity because of its motto and ideals . 
" My process was one of the most life-changing things I have ever experienced , " White said . 
" It meant coming into my own as a man and committing myself to something that was bigger than me . 
It meant understanding the true meaning of friendship and brotherhood . " 
Preparing for their presentation can be emotionally , mentally and , at times , physically toiling , <ORGANIZATION>White</ORGANIZATION> said . 
The preparation process is secretive , which dates back to the <DATE>1980s</DATE> when historically black fraternities and sororities decided to move underground . 
" The process is meant to challenge you , your mind and your spirit , " fourth-year College student and <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Phi Alpha</ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON>Colin Williams</PERSON> said . 
" You are finally finishing your process . 
The one thing you need to do is focus on the end-goal and stay true to the reasons why you wanted to join the fraternity . " 
Once members enter the fraternity , they began participating in the organization 's service projects . 
Historically black fraternities are predominantly service organizations , rarely hosting parties and instead focusing on giving back to the community , <PERSON>Onuoha</PERSON> said . 
" We take pride in service first and foremost , " <PERSON>Onuoha</PERSON> said . 
" We might have one to two parties a semester . 
<ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> fraternities might have parties once every two weeks and only have one big service event a semester . 
With us , we have weekly servicing . " 
While <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> chapters recruit first years , chapters which are part of the <ORGANIZATION>National Pan-Hellenic Council</ORGANIZATION> initiate third or fourth years . 
Black fraternities and sororities look for individuals who have already established themselves within the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , as becoming a member is a life-long commitment . 
" They say the real work starts after you graduate , " White said . 
" The vast majority of <ORGANIZATION>Omega</ORGANIZATION> members are graduates . 
We bring in more initiates through graduate chapters than undergraduate chapters . " 
Although black fraternities differ from <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> organizations , they are subject to the same regulations . 
For example , after the publication of a Rolling Stone article detailing allegations of sexual assault at <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity , frustration resonated among members of the <ORGANIZATION>National Pan-Hellenic Council</ORGANIZATION> when President <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> suspended all fraternal events . 
" We were involved in absolutely none of the conversations that took place regarding University-wide remediation on a wide scale , " White said . 
" We were n't included in the conversation and yet we still faced the same sanctions the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> did in terms of being suspended . 
I do think that we are underrepresented and underacknowledged . " 
In the future , <PERSON>Onuoha</PERSON> said black fraternity members hope to see greater representation within the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community and collaboration among different councils . " 
[ I hope to see ] more interaction between the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>NPHC</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Onuoha</PERSON> said . 
" It does n't happen frequently enough . 
Also , general knowledge about each other [ is important ] . 
Some <ORGANIZATION>NPHC</ORGANIZATION> organizations do n't know what <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> organizations do and they just stereotype . 
I feel like people just need a better understanding of [ both ] . "
