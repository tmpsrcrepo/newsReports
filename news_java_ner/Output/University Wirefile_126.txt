With a grant from the <ORGANIZATION>National Institute of Justice</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , researchers at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia Health System</ORGANIZATION> are looking to improve scientific techniques used to identify offenders in sexual assault cases . 
<PERSON>Richard Rau</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>NIJ</ORGANIZATION> senior program manager for forensic sciences , said the project aims to decrease the enormous backlog of forensic evidence sitting in crime laboratories . 
Cell biologists , with the aid of <MONEY>$ 300,000</MONEY> in funding , are looking at ways to pull male sperm cells away from cells of the sexual assault victim . 
The DNA can then be extracted from the male sperm and used to identify possible suspects . 
" By separating and then amplifying DNA cells , we are able to more efficiently determine identities " of sex offenders , said <PERSON>Margaretta Allietta</PERSON> , a lab specialist working on the project . 
Researchers at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> are working with the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Division of Forensic Science</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> to allow for the smooth transition of the technology from research to crime lab . 
Researchers said they hope to have a prototype ready for testing by the end of the year . 
The use of robotics allows the process to move more quickly . 
" The current system used for DNA testing is a long and tedious process that is no longer adequate , " <PERSON>Allietta</PERSON> said . 
" Through automation , crime labs will be able to efficiently analyze hundreds of samples of swabs taken from rape victims . " 
Researchers spent the past year planning the project . 
Congressional funding recently was given to the <ORGANIZATION>NIJ</ORGANIZATION> , the research and development portion of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Justice</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Rau</PERSON> said . 
The grant to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and the potential breakthrough in the field of DNA testing have been eagerly anticipated by many , from those in the legislature to those working in crime labs , he said . 
The principal investigator for the project is <PERSON>John Herr</PERSON> , director of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Research in Reproductive Health</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Herr is away on business and could not be reached for comment .
