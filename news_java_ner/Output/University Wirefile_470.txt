The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Friday</DATE> the publication of final changes made to the Clery Act by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of <DATE>2013</DATE> . 
The new changes include requiring institutions to report incidents of stalking and incorporate a statement of policy about programs aimed at curbing dating violence , domestic violence , sexual assault and stalking in its annual security report . 
The combination of the new changes and existing standards aim to render the Clery Act more effective to address sexual violence on college campuses . 
The Clery Act requires institutions of higher education in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to disclose crimes which occur either on campus , on public property adjacent to or within campus , or in campus-affiliated properties . 
Secretary of Education <PERSON>Arne Duncan</PERSON> , Under Secretary <PERSON>Ted Mitchell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lynn Mahaffie</PERSON> , acting assistant secretary for postsecondary education , held a press call <DATE>Friday</DATE> , opening the floor for questions about the updated requirements . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>Department</ORGANIZATION> has the responsibility to ensure that all students have the opportunity to learn and grow in a safe environment , " <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON> said . 
In addition to the new stalking requirements , the changes also mandate the inclusion of gender identity and national origin as categories of bias that serve as the determination of a hate crime . 
" Hopefully it 'll help bring ... issues more into the national discourse and give more attention to issues like intimate partner violence at U.Va. , " said third-year College student <PERSON>Sara Surface</PERSON> , the external chair of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I 'm happy to see that the issue of sexual assault is finally getting the attention it deserves . 
It 's good to see [ the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> ] tackling the issue , but there will always be tensions when the people making policy are n't the ones actually working on the ground with the issue . " 
Surface said there is much work to be done in regards to definitions of consent and how colleges can apply these definitions . 
The final rule will not go into effect until <DATE>July 1 , 2015</DATE> . 
It will be formally published in the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Register</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Monday , Oct. 20</DATE> . 
Because <ORGANIZATION>VAWA</ORGANIZATION> statutory provisions are currently in effect , institutions are expected to make a good faith effort to comply with the requirements . 
<PERSON>Duncan</PERSON> said he does not know if there would be any fines levied against schools that do not include certain categories , such as domestic violence and stalking , in their reports before <DATE>July 1</DATE> .
