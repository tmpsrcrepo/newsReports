<PERSON>Thomas Bynum</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily Gov. <PERSON>McAuliffe</PERSON> announced the establishment of a new <ORGANIZATION>Equal Opportunity Legislative Agenda</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> . 
The agenda aims to promote economic growth by making the workplace more comfortable for Virginians , especially women and homosexual , bisexual , transgender and queer individuals . 
" In a new <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> economy , we need to be able to attract the best and brightest entrepreneurs here , build a workforce for the <DATE>21st century</DATE> and ensure that the next generation of Virginians has greater opportunity to succeed , " <PERSON>McAuliffe</PERSON> said in a press release <DATE>Monday</DATE> . 
" All that depends on having a business-friendly environment where every Virginian is treated equally and fairly under the law , no matter their background , gender , or whom they love . " 
When first elected into office , <PERSON>McAuliffe</PERSON> banned sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Equal Opportunity Agenda</ORGANIZATION> proposes that all wording directly refering to " husband and wife " and " man and woman " simply be changed to " spouse , " ensuring same-sex couples receive the same benefits and government protections as opposite-sex couples . 
McAuliffe 's proposal also addressed gender discrimination , with a press release stating " today , women are paid just <MONEY>79 cents</MONEY> for every dollar a man makes in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . " 
McAuliffe hopes to address this discrepancy by creating harsher penalties for employers who violate equal pay laws . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Equal Opportunity Agenda</ORGANIZATION> goes on to propose further protections for women " by directing the <ORGANIZATION>State Council of Higher Education</ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> to assist in the development of updated sexual misconduct policies at all <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> public institutions of higher education by <DATE>July 31 , 2015</DATE> , " according to the press release . 
Among the proposals are including expulsions on the transcripts of those found in violation of the university 's conduct policy , and requiring businesses with employees who are survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault to allow them to take leaves of absence to receive counseling . 
This leave also extends to victims ' family members if they are helping the victim recover . 
McAuliffe also proposed changes to current abortion laws , including a stipulation to , " repeal the <DATE>2012</DATE> Virginia law that requires all women to undergo a mandatory ultrasound before seeking pregnancy termination . "
