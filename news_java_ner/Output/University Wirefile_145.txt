<ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> , a large energy resource development company now in the middle of a hot <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> debate regarding its business in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> , continues to deny any alleged misconduct in its dealings with the military-led nation . 
The California-based company absolutely has not engaged in any form of misconduct , <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Barry Lane</PERSON> said . 
<LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> , a small country in <LOCATION>Southeast Asia</LOCATION> wedged between <LOCATION>Bangladesh</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> , has been the recent subject of intense international and local controversy . 
The nation 's government , which can be categorized as a repressive " military regime " with a poor humanitarian record , overturned democratic elections in <DATE>1990</DATE> , according to the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> . 
Although <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> has not denied the Burmese government is repressive , the company itself has " totally adhered to Western labor standards , " <PERSON>Lane</PERSON> said . 
Smaller than <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> relies on natural gas as one of its chief resources . 
The country began developing its resource , discovered in the early <DATE>1990s</DATE> , with the formation of the <ORGANIZATION>Moattama Gas Transportation Company</ORGANIZATION> . 
University of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's role <ORGANIZATION>The University</ORGANIZATION> currently owns about <MONEY>$ 1.5 million</MONEY> worth -- or roughly <PERCENT>0.02 percent</PERCENT> -- of <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> stock , said <PERSON>Alice Handy</PERSON> , president of <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia Investment Management Company</ORGANIZATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has " external managers to make the decisions on what companies to invest in , " she said , and " right now we have stock in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> company that just happens to be involved in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> now is valued at more than <MONEY>$ 8.1 billion</MONEY> , <PERSON>Lane</PERSON> said , which is equivalent to " 254 million shares at approximately <MONEY>$ 32</MONEY> and change . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> , in turn , owns <PERCENT>28.4 percent</PERCENT> of the <MONEY>$ 1 billion</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>Moattama Gas Transportation Company</ORGANIZATION> . 
<ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> is one of four investors in the <LOCATION>Moattama</LOCATION> Gas <ORGANIZATION>Transportation Company</ORGANIZATION> , which include companies from several nations . 
A French oil and gas company <ORGANIZATION>TotalFinaElf S.A.</ORGANIZATION> is the " project builder and operator , " with a <PERCENT>31.24 percent</PERCENT> interest . 
<LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>PTT Exploration & Production Public Co. Ltd.</ORGANIZATION> , with <PERCENT>25.5 percent</PERCENT> interest , and the Burmese state-owned <ORGANIZATION>Myanmar Oil & Gas Enterprise</ORGANIZATION> , with <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> interest , are the other project investors . 
The controversy In <DATE>1996</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Moattama Gas Transportation Company</ORGANIZATION> began construction on the Yadana pipeline project in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> . 
The pipeline currently is used to carry natural gas from the Yadana gas field , located 43 miles offshore , to <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> to fuel a major power station operated by the Thai government . 
The project involved the placement of 412 kilometers of pipeline , 39 miles of which cross the Burmese mainland . 
Various international contractors managed the pipeline 's construction , and 74 Burmese college graduates operate the Yadana project 's operations . 
According to <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> , the project has contributed to " modernization and social change " in the region . 
<ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> and its partners have been a source of " socioeconomic aid and programs for the Burmese citizens " in the form of hospitals and infrastructure improvements , <PERSON>Lane</PERSON> said . 
The other side of the issue Nationwide objection to the Yadana pipeline project in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> centers on the human rights atrocities committed by the country 's ruling military dictatorship , the <ORGANIZATION>State Peace and Development Council</ORGANIZATION> . 
According to <ORGANIZATION>Ka Hsa Wa</ORGANIZATION> , director and cofounder of <ORGANIZATION>EarthRights International</ORGANIZATION> , a human rights and environmental protection organization , military violations include forced slavery , rapes and murders . 
The Burmese state-owned <ORGANIZATION>Myanmar Oil & Gas Enterprise</ORGANIZATION> receives <MONEY>$ 150</MONEY> to <MONEY>$ 400 million</MONEY> per year from the pipeline project , half of which is used to fund the Burmese army , Wa said . 
The army is responsible for relocating several villages , including the village of <ORGANIZATION>Mi Chaung Laung</ORGANIZATION> , and causing thousands of Burmese people to flee the country , said <PERSON>Katie Redford</PERSON> , co-director of EarthRights and a <DATE>1995</DATE> graduate of the <ORGANIZATION>University Law School</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Hundreds of people who have fled <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> have testified " to the atrocities , she said . 
<ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> , on the other hand , said the idea that villages were relocated is a " common misperception . " 
Wa said the sentiment of the Burmese people in the pipeline area regarding <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> is that " if the white people [ leave ] , the military will [ leave ] . " 
<PERSON>Aung San Suu Kyi</PERSON> , leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Burmese National League of Democracy</ORGANIZATION> , who led her opposition party to win <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>Parliament</ORGANIZATION> in the nullified <DATE>1990</DATE> election , has spoken out in support of sanctions on trade with <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> , said <PERSON>Jeremy Woodram</PERSON> , director of the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> , branch of the <ORGANIZATION>Free Burma Coalition</ORGANIZATION> . 
The Coalition is a group working to nurture grass-roots support for freedom and democracy in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Labor</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Human Rights Commission</ORGANIZATION> all have condemned the military regime , <PERSON>Woodram</PERSON> said . 
In <DATE>1997</DATE> former President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> imposed sanctions against <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> for its human rights violations , an act that compelled many American businesses to leave <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> . 
President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> also has expressed his support for sanctions against <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> . 
The campaign , especially on college campuses , " has had a very strong effect inside <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> , " <PERSON>Woodram</PERSON> said . 
" These types of actions at universities do have concrete and real effects . " 
The verdict In <DATE>1997</DATE> a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Federal District court agreed to hear <ORGANIZATION>EarthRights International</ORGANIZATION> 's claims against <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>Doe v. Unocal</ORGANIZATION> . 
After three years the court granted <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> 's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case . 
Although the court agreed " <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> knew that forced labor was being utilized , " it said because " there are no facts suggesting that <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> sought to employ forced or slave labor , " there was insufficient evidence to establish liability under international law . 
The ruling currently is in appeal . 
At <ORGANIZATION>the University the Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> on its <DATE>October</DATE> meeting agenda its decision to hear concerns related to a unanimous <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> resolution regarding the divestment of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> assets in <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> . 
Council will present its position regarding <ORGANIZATION>Unocal</ORGANIZATION> investments to the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Oct. 19</DATE> .
