The definition of rape , as written by state law , has evolved significantly in the past century . 
What was originally defined as the " unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman against her will " - requiring lack of consent and evidence of resistance - has been expanded to be gender unspecific on the part of both the victim and perpetrator . 
Additionally , evidence of resistance is no longer required , and marital rape has been fostered into the law . 
While important strides have been made in ensuring the definition of sexual assault is as expansive as possible , semantic elements of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> sexual assault law remain highly stigmatic . 
This is most visibly evidenced in the <DATE>Feb. 10</DATE> charge against <PERSON>Jesse Matthew</PERSON> of " abduction with the intent to defile . " 
News sources used sexual assault , rape and molestation interchangeably with the word defile , saying " he had the intent , at that point , to defile , or sexually molest her . " 
Etymologically , the word " defile " has a deeply religious connotation , and has been used as a value judgment for centuries . 
Originally derived from the French word " defouler , " in the <DATE>15th century</DATE> defile meant to " desecrate or profane . " 
But it was n't until defile was used as the English translation of the Greek word " ?????? 
, " or to " render common , " in the <PERSON>King James</PERSON> translation of the Bible that " defile " took on a moral connotation . 
In a time when a woman 's value derived from her virginity - a time when chastity eclipsed all other virtues in significance - to have sex was to be desecrated or profaned . 
This correlation of values persisted even until the <DATE>19th century</DATE> , when such nomenclature was used in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>State v. Montgomery</ORGANIZATION> . 
In <DATE>1890</DATE> , <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> resident <PERSON>George Montgomery</PERSON> was charged under criminal law with having " unlawfully and feloniously [ taken ] one <PERSON>Sophia Wheelock</PERSON> . . . against her will and by force and menace and duress , compelled her . . . to be defiled , " with the definition of defile outlined to mean " to pollute , to corrupt the chastity of , to debauch or to violate . " 
It was also noted that " defile " did not " connotate previous immaculateness . " 
At the time , state prosecutors used terms like " immaculate " to mean virginity and " defile " to mean assault . 
The word " defile " appeared in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> legislation for the first time in <DATE>1950</DATE> with the writing of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Code Â § 18.2-48 , titled " Abduction . . . for immoral purpose . " 
In the law today , the word defile officially means to " corrupt the integrity of a thing " - applying to both trampled flags or to sexually assaulted people . 
It is easy to disregard this definition as an unfortunate byproduct of an archaic time - a backwards reflection of historically rampant sexism . 
But what is impossible to reconcile is the understanding that this month , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> state prosecutors announced publicly , and to the family and friends of <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> , that their peer , friend , teammate and daughter had been defiled . 
As a guest lecturer in Public Policy Challenges of the <ORGANIZATION>21st Century</ORGANIZATION> at the beginning of <DATE>February</DATE> , Professor <PERSON>Anne Coughlin</PERSON> posed a question to the class : Imagine the difficulty of telling <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> 's parents their daughter had been abducted , murdered and likely assaulted - an unfathomable task . 
Now imagine telling them their daughter had been defiled . 
She had been violated , yes . 
But defiled ? 
She was somehow less of a person - desecrated , profaned - because of the actions of another ? 
<PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> was not defiled . 
Neither were <ORGANIZATION>Elizabeth Smart or Jaycee Lee Dugard</ORGANIZATION> . 
Yet the sentences of Smart and <ORGANIZATION>Dugard</ORGANIZATION> 's perpetrators more accurately reflect the nature of their crimes . 
<PERSON>Brian Mitchell</PERSON> , Smart 's kidnapper , was charged by a <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> state judge with " unlawful transportation of a minor across state lines for sex , " and <PERSON>Phillip Garrido</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Dugard</ORGANIZATION> 's kidnapper , was sentenced to 431 years to life in prison in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> for " kidnapping and sexual assault . " 
These sentences , void of value judgements , stand as examples for the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> legislature to consider in rewriting legal codes . 
State officials must understand that the law code , as it is currently written , takes survivors ' value away from them semantically and only furthers their feelings of alienation , exacerbating the trauma they have experienced . 
It is critical that , amidst the passage of two bills on reformed sexual assault prosecution in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> , the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> legislature reconsider the rhetoric of its legal code in order to eliminate value judgments and stigmatizing semantics - changing " defiled " to what it should be aptly called : assault .
