A former <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Medical Center</ORGANIZATION> employee , convicted of sexually assaulting two patients while on duty in the psychiatric ward in <DATE>April</DATE> and <DATE>May of 2001</DATE> , was sentenced to 10 years in prison <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> . 
<PERSON>Rudolph T. Johnson</PERSON> , 47 , previously pled guilty to two counts of aggravated sexual battery , which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years each . 
<PERSON>Lloyd Snook</PERSON> , <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> 's attorney , said the case was particularly difficult because both <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> and the two victims gave unreliable accounts of the incidents . 
" It 's really hard to figure out what should happen , " <PERSON>Snook</PERSON> said . 
" We pled guilty to something that does n't fit either version of events . " 
Johnson , called by <ORGANIZATION>Snook</ORGANIZATION> to the witness stand , claimed that both incidents were consensual . 
He alleged that the first victim " pulled me down on her and massaged my legs " and the second victim also invited him to make sexual contact . 
Johnson admitted to having sex with the first patient but denied penetration occurred with the second . 
" I did not rape " the first patient , he said . 
" I did have intercourse with this lady . " 
Commonwealth Attorney <PERSON>Elizabeth V. Killeen</PERSON> argued that , because the patients had received serious pain medications , they were largely unable to resist <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> 's advances . 
Killeen presented medication records for the first victim , which indicated she had received heavy dosages of Ativan -- a common sedative in the same family as traveler 's drugs such as Valium and Serax . 
" These levels [ of Ativan ] approach those of a patient undergoing anesthesia , " said Dr. <PERSON>Julia Pearson</PERSON> , supervisor of the toxicology unit in the state division of forensic science called to the stand by <LOCATION>Killeen</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Killeen</PERSON> said that the two sides agreed to convict <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> of aggravated sexual battery because of the difficulty of going to trial in a rape case . 
" The primary factor was that , especially in the case of the first woman , there were issues of whether she was conscious , " <PERSON>Killeen</PERSON> said . 
She said cases of drug-aided rape require that the victim be either unconscious or unable to communicate to get a conviction . 
" Cases involving the administration of drugs are very difficult , " she added . 
In <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> 's defense , <PERSON>Snook</PERSON> called to the stand <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> 's wife , <PERSON>Dorenda Johnson</PERSON> , who made an emotional testimony to <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> 's integrity as a husband and a father . 
" Ruddy is a very caring and giving person , " she said . 
" My children love their father and need their father . " 
Johnson 's sons are 7 and 9 years old . 
Killeen recommended that the judge sentence <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> to seven and a half years for each assault count , while <PERSON>Snook</PERSON> argued that the judge use the sentencing guidelines for the case , which recommended an average of about six and a half years jail time . 
In his closing statement at the time of his verdict , <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON>Edward L. Hogshire</PERSON> said he was particularly concerned with the fact that the two victims were under <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> 's care . 
" The events took place in a hospital , " he said . 
" There have to be consequences , and I do n't think the guidelines address this kind of thing . " 
Hogshire also said he believed 10 years was an appropriate sentence for such a case . 
" This is one of the more difficult cases , " he said . 
" I think overall this is fair . "
