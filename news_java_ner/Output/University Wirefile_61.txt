In response to safety concerns for students on and off Grounds , <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> students soon may be supplied with safety whistles and educational pamphlets informing them what to do if they are attacked . 
If the proposal of <PERSON>Asieh Nariman</PERSON> , second-year College student and <ORGANIZATION>Lambeth Area Council</ORGANIZATION> vice president , is implemented , whistles will be distributed to all <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students . 
If attacked , students can blow the whistles and alert others to help them . 
" You could use the whistle anywhere , " <PERSON>Nariman</PERSON> said . 
" Even in an apartment or a fraternity house . " 
Students would also be given information pamphlets about how and when to use the whistles , and other ways to deter attacks . 
Nariman also hopes to offer classes at the beginning of each school year to teach students about how to avoid assaults near Grounds . 
She said she first introduced the plan to the Lambeth Area Council in response to the sexual assault that occurred near Lambeth in the <DATE>fall</DATE> , but then decided to apply the idea to the entire <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
She added that <PERSON>William W. Harmon</PERSON> , vice president for student affairs , helped <PERSON>Nariman</PERSON> put the project together and said she could count on <MONEY>$ 3,000</MONEY> of the initial funding from his office . 
<PERSON>Harmon</PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION>the University of Pittsburgh</ORGANIZATION> , where he used to work , also used whistles as a safety tool . 
" I think it 's a good idea , " he said . 
" It 's just one way of developing deterrent and one way students can call attention to themselves if they are threatened . " 
He said <PERSON>Nariman</PERSON> had originally wanted to buy 9,000 whistles , but said he believed the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should initially purchase only four or 5,000 . 
" I think we should start small , " he added . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Alumni Association</ORGANIZATION> has also pledged <MONEY>$ 1,000</MONEY> for the whistle initiative , <PERSON>Nariman</PERSON> said . 
According to <PERSON>Nariman</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> and the Inter-sorority Council both support the whistle plan and have agreed to help with distribution , education and funding . 
Nariman plans to distribute whistles to men as well as women because , " if a guy is being assaulted , it 's okay to alert other guys . " 
She said if men had whistles , they could also alert other men to help a woman who is being attacked . 
Nariman also worked with Dean of Students <PERSON>Robert T. Canevari</PERSON> on the whistle proposal . 
" I support her efforts to educate and make people aware of safety concerns and to make whistles available and to give them to people who want them , " <PERSON>Canevari</PERSON> said . 
Although she has received support from the <ORGANIZATION>Police Department</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>the University Alumni Association</ORGANIZATION> and the Parents Program , some students are skeptical about whether the whistles will help improve safety on Grounds . 
" I do n't think it will help because at the point you have to use [ the whistle ] it will be too late , " second-year College student <PERSON>Erika Rietz</PERSON> said . 
But she said it 's a " nice sentiment . " 
First-year College student <PERSON>Julia Villa</PERSON> agreed that the whistles may not help prevent attacks . 
" I guess it 's a nice concept , but how many people are actually going to wear the whistles and use them ? " 
Villa said . 
<PERSON>Nariman</PERSON> said she hopes the program will be implemented this <DATE>fall</DATE> . 
" The whistles are not a joke , " she said . 
" We definitely care about the safety of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students . "
