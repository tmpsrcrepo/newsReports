Days after <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> and a group of parents put up a <MONEY>$ 10,000</MONEY> reward to help catch the man who raped a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student in her home <DATE>last Thursday</DATE> , police are answering calls from people responding with information about the case . 
However , only about 10 to <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> of the people calling police with tips are interested in the reward money , said <PERSON>Richard Hudson</PERSON> , a <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police</ORGANIZATION> detective who answers phones at the Crimestoppers hotline . 
The shocking nature of such a crime naturally generates a lot of interest -- and a lot of calls , <PERSON>Hudson</PERSON> said . 
" I 've been doing this for 17 years and I 've seen a lot of sexual assaults , " he said . 
" This one was definitely unique and not like one I 'd ever seen before . " 
Rapes have occurred at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> before , including one that took place near Beta Bridge last year , but the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> never supplied reward money to catch a criminal until now . 
But the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's offer of a reward in this case does not set a precedent . 
In the future , it will be decided on a case-by-case basis , said <PERSON>Leonard W. Sandridge</PERSON> , executive vice-president and chief financial officer . 
" This was a particularly despicable crime . 
I do not recall another case where the criminal broke into a private residence , raped an individual in the presence of others and used a gun , " <PERSON>Sandridge</PERSON> said . 
The rape occurred in the presence of the victim 's male friend , shattering many students ' sense of safety in their own homes . 
Anyone with information about the crime should call the Crimestoppers hotline at 977-4000 .
