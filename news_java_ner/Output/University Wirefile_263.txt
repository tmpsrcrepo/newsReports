After more than four hours of deliberation , the jury in the trial of former <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Anne Hylton</PERSON> delivered its verdict at <TIME>8:30 Wednesday night</TIME> . 
The jury ruled in <LOCATION>Hylton</LOCATION> 's favor and awarded her <MONEY>$ 150,000</MONEY> , according to <PERSON>Doug Winegardner</PERSON> , the defendant 's attorney . 
The civil lawsuit was held after <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> filed charges against fellow alumnus <PERSON>Matthew Hamilton</PERSON> , alleging he had raped her in <DATE>December 2001</DATE> . 
<PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> 's attorney , <PERSON>Steven Rosenfield</PERSON> , said he was pleased with the outcome of the trial and considered it a victory . 
" It took a lot of courage for a woman who claimed to be raped to come forward and endure a public trial on such serious and sensitive issues , because very few rape victims come out from behind the shadows , " <PERSON>Rosenfield</PERSON> said . 
" It goes to show that with courage and perseverance , a woman who is the victim of rape can have her day in court and be vindicated . " 
Because <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> was suing <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> for <MONEY>$ 1.5 million</MONEY> with an additional <MONEY>$ 350,000</MONEY> for punitive damages , <PERSON>Winegardner</PERSON> said he believed , without having spoken to the jury , the jury 's decision was " something of a compromise verdict . " 
Winegardner added that <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> adamantly denied the allegation he gave <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> a date-rape drug and that he and <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> are considering post-trial motions and appellate issues . 
<PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , director of sexual and domestic violence services at the <ORGANIZATION>University Women 's Center</ORGANIZATION> , pointed out that <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> was not awarded the punitive damages she sought because according to law , if a person is harmed while committing an illegal act , he or she can not receive punitive damages . 
Because <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> had been drinking illegally at the party where the incident in question occurred , she was not eligible to receive such compensation . 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said while she is uncertain about the impact the case could have in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community , she still hopes it can teach students a valuable lesson . 
" There was a moral victory more than a financial victory , and I hope an educational victory to acknowledge that there 's stuff going on here amongst students that does n't just happen to other people , it happens to people like us , " she said . 
Although he and his client were not awarded as much money as they had requested , <PERSON>Rosenfield</PERSON> said <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> was " thrilled " the jury decided she had been wronged . 
" Part of the defense was to blame the victim , one of the greatest fears for women in these circumstances , and the jury rejected blaming Annie , " he said . 
In addition , <PERSON>Rosenfield</PERSON> said he believed the jury 's decision to award <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> the money carried a powerful message . 
" The <MONEY>$ 150,000</MONEY> reward speaks mountains for how seriously harmed they believed she was , " <PERSON>Rosenfield</PERSON> said . 
" It was vindication . "
