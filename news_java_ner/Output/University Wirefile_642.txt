<PERSON>Marshall Bronfin</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily Four political activists arrested on the steps of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity in <DATE>November</DATE> pled guilty to trespassing charges last week in <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville General District Court</ORGANIZATION> . 
All four participants are from <LOCATION>Louisa County</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . 
Paxus <PERSON>Calta</PERSON> , <PERSON>Sapphyre Miria</PERSON> , <PERSON>Edmund Frost</PERSON> and <PERSON>Caroline Berner</PERSON> gathered at the fraternity house on <DATE>Nov. 22</DATE> in the wake of a Rolling Stone article describing an alleged gang rape at <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity . 
<ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police</ORGANIZATION> arrived and asked the protesters to leave , but they remained seated on the fraternity steps and were soon arrested . 
The four arrestees plead guilty to trespassing <DATE>Feb. 20</DATE> , and each received the same sentence of 44 hours of community service . 
They will begin serving the hours in the next 60 days at The Haven , a homeless shelter in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> . 
Previously arrested approximately 50 times for nonviolent protests , <PERSON>Calta</PERSON> said he is usually involved in anti-nuclear protests and has only been arrested once previously in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> with the <LOCATION>Occupy Charlottesville</LOCATION> protest . 
Miria and <PERSON>Berner</PERSON> both released a joint statement before sentencing . 
" We chose to remain seated to give a visible example of the absurdity of our culture where we can so swiftly have the law brought down on us for trespassing while nothing happens to perpetrators of sexual violence , " the statement read . 
Calta and <ORGANIZATION>Frost</ORGANIZATION> gave separate statements at trial . 
" For our non-violent protest against rapes at <LOCATION>U.Va.</LOCATION> , we were swiftly arrested , " <PERSON>Calta</PERSON> said in his statement . 
" Yet repeated reports of sexual assaults on campus are ignored by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> police department . 
I plan to do my community service for an organization which is working to address this injustice . " 
According to his statement , <ORGANIZATION>Frost</ORGANIZATION> also said he objects to the priorities of institutions that arrest and prosecute trespassers during a protest but fail to hold rapists accountable for their actions . 
" We are guilty of trespassing on the property of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Frost</PERSON> said in his statement . 
" I want to know when and how the rapists , and the institutions that shelter them , that enable them , that marginalize the survivors , and that fail to protect women from violence will be held accountable . " 
<PERSON>Calta</PERSON> said he hopes members of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community will continue to speak out for change toward a heavily consent-based culture and address the larger issue of sexual assault running rampant through all universities . 
" I have never gotten as much publicity as at this unplanned arrest at U.Va. , " <PERSON>Calta</PERSON> said . 
" Now is the historical time to change the nature of sexual assault at universities . 
It has been too silent for too long . "
