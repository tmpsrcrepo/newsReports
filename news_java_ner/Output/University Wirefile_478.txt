In <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> 's founding of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , he stressed the importance of students being involved in public affairs and public service . 
He knew that what happened beyond the classroom would have a significant impact on the world we live in today . 
Jefferson 's ideas are as important today as they were when he founded the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
I know students across Grounds are involved in issues of importance around the globe . 
But , there are many opportunities for students to have an impact right here at home in the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> . 
With the <DATE>November 4</DATE> election just around the corner , issues important to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community are on the ballot - especially those that involve reducing the burden of student debt , addressing campus sexual assault and working to expand job opportunities for recent graduates . 
In the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> I have worked in a bipartisan way to address these issues and many more . 
My story may be much like yours : I was the first in my family to graduate from college . 
I was able to pay for my degree by working part time and taking on student debt . 
And after finishing my education , I tried to start a business but failed - not once , but twice . 
What I learned through those experiences is something that no one tells you : getting it right the first time is the exception , not the rule . 
Fortunately , I was able to get back on my feet , and my third attempt ultimately became the company Nextel . 
But I would not have had three chances to try - and fail - if I faced the same amount of student debt that today 's students face . 
This <DATE>September</DATE> I stopped by the O'Hill Forum to talk to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students about the impact of student debt . 
College graduates in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> carry nearly <MONEY>$ 30,000</MONEY> in student loan debt . 
Too many young people are being forced to put off decisions about starting a family , launching a startup business or buying a home because of the burden of student debt . 
As a result of these campus conversations , I have rolled up my sleeves and worked with Republicans and Democrats on specific proposals that will go a long way towards helping young Virginians prepare for college , responsibly manage their student loan debts and find good jobs upon graduation . 
These ideas include my work with <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> Republican Senator <PERSON>Marco Rubio</PERSON> to make the costs and benefits of college much more transparent and to help students and their parents make more informed decisions when picking a college . 
For those facing student loan debts upon graduation , I have proposed capping the amount of loan repayments at <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of your monthly income , and providing employers with the option to offer <MONEY>$ 5,000</MONEY> pre-tax to help employees pay off their student debts directly . 
After graduation , students should have access to world-class jobs in all parts of the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> . 
I am working across the aisle to reduce unnecessary regulations so startups can thrive and to embrace new methods like crowdfunding so that our entrepreneurs have easier access to capital . 
With the right policies in place , I believe the next <ORGANIZATION>Google</ORGANIZATION> or Facebook could start right here in the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> . 
I also spoke to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students about the importance of college safety . 
I recently joined a group of Senate Democrats and Republicans to introduce the Campus Accountability and Safety Act aimed at making college safer for all young women and men . 
The statistics are horrendous - one out of every five college women is estimated to be the victim of a sexual assault . 
We need to change that . 
This bill will strengthen training and accountability standards for sexual assault and encourages universities to take proactive steps to create a safer campus environment . 
It is these types of bipartisan efforts that prove good policy is not based on whether you are a Democrat or a Republican ; it is about whether you are solving the problems facing Virginians . 
We have just a few days until the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Senate</ORGANIZATION> election on <DATE>November 4</DATE> - if you give me the honor of rehiring me , I will continue to partner with those on both sides of the aisle to find commonsense solutions to expand opportunity and to move <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> forward . 
Mark <ORGANIZATION>Warner</ORGANIZATION> is the senior <ORGANIZATION>United States Senator</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> .
