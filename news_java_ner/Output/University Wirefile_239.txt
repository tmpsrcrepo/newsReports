IT IS commonly thought that politics and religion are topics too controversial to be discussed in polite company . 
Yet the Rev. <PERSON>Irene Monroe</PERSON> provocatively held forth on both topics as she lectured a packed house at the <LOCATION>Kaleidoscope Lounge</LOCATION> <DATE>last Monday</DATE> . 
Perhaps it is not surprising that <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> attracted such a large crowd , as she described the purpose of her lecture to " inform the public of the role religion plays in discrimination against LGBT people and how religious intolerance and fundamentalism not only shatters the goal of American democracy , but also aids in perpetuating other forms of oppressions such as racism , sexism , ' classism ' and anti-Semitism . " 
These are stands that attract special controversy today , as it was but a few weeks ago that our Christian conservative president was reelected by a nation rigidly divided on religious grounds , and particularly polarized by issues of " gay rights . " 
<PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> was certainly provocative , as she spoke in rapid-fire fashion , jumping from one heated issue to the next . 
In a relatively short lecture , <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> worked in discussions of <LOCATION>Jesus</LOCATION> , <PERSON>O.J. Simpson</PERSON> , <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> and the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> serial rapist , among many , many other topics . 
She opened with a discussion of <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> 's affair with <PERSON>Sally Hemmings</PERSON> , charging the venerable Virginian with " dipping in chocolate " and violating his marriage vows . 
Much of <ORGANIZATION>Monroe</ORGANIZATION> 's talk verged on the humorous , if unintentionally , as she drew uproarious laughter by wondering aloud whether any of Jesus ' 12 apostles were gay . 
Yet for all of her over-the-top qualities , <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> did have a serious point to make . 
Monroe decried conservative Christian denominations for " trampling on civil rights in the name of Jesus , " and argued that " the ministry of Jesus is about inclusivity . " 
She called marriage " an inalienable right " that can not constitutionally be denied to gay people . 
<PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> also attempted to tie the gay rights movement by implication to the struggle for rights for African-Americans , and blasted black churches for ignoring issues of gay rights . 
But <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> 's stands are not without costs of their own , to those of us who do not share her moral convictions on homosexuality . 
If <PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> is right , is it morally tenable to permit discrimination against gays in our society ? 
The distinction between state action and private action is a blurred and indistinct one , and one that may not be tenable in light of <ORGANIZATION>Monroe</ORGANIZATION> 's strong criticisms of anti-gay discrimination . 
<PERSON>Monroe</PERSON> did not squarely address these questions , however . 
She said , " you can have your point of view to the extent it does not oppress me , " but that does not resolve anything . 
As <ORGANIZATION>UCLA</ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON>Eugene Volokh</PERSON> notes on his blog , " The broad gay rights program is n't just about increasing the freedom of gays ; it is also about decreasing the freedom of those who do n't want to associate with gays in various ways . " 
Antidiscrimination laws , a key component of the gay rights agenda , would restrict the associational rights of individuals who do not wish to associate with homosexuals for moral reasons or otherwise . 
And if history is any guide , churches will not be immune either . 
In <DATE>March of this year</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>California Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> upheld application to a Catholic charity of that state 's law , enacted in the name of ensuring equal rights for women , mandating employers to offer insurance coverage for contraceptives , a stand opposed to the religious beliefs of the Catholic church . 
In the <DATE>1970s</DATE> , in an action upheld by <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> withdrew the tax exemption of <ORGANIZATION>Bob Jones University</ORGANIZATION> for its racially discriminatory policies , despite <PERSON>Bob Jones</PERSON> ' claim that these practices were motivated by scripture . 
The gay rights movement , at its core , is a movement for the hearts and minds of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
Yet as such , it wishes to force its moral values on society as surely as evangelical Christians do . 
Monroe may say she preaches toleration , but we should realize that her views have consequences for the rights of all of us , gay or straight .
