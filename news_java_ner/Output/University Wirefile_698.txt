<PERSON>Sarah MacAdam</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily After <PERSON>Bontempo</PERSON> and <PERSON>McLean</PERSON> gave their opening remarks , conference attendees broke into groups to brainstorm about potential concerns and developing methods for next year 's issue . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Policy Review</ORGANIZATION> hosted a conference <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> on the publication of a <ORGANIZATION>Nationwide Sexual Assault Policy</ORGANIZATION> for universities . 
The conference , which hosted graduate students from various disciplines across the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , was a preliminary step toward publishing a special issue in the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Policy Review early in <DATE>April 2016</DATE> . 
The issue seeks to include various pieces on topics relating to law , health , finance , personal experiences , safety and campus design . 
One of the points raised at the conference was gathering an editorial board to oversee the development of the publication over the next year . 
<PERSON>Frank Bontempo</PERSON> , the outgoing editor-in-chief of the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Policy Review</ORGANIZATION> , said they would like to look at sexual assault policy as an interdisciplinary issue on a nationwide scale as well as with a focus on the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" There 's been a lot going on recently on campus . 
There was <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> , the Rolling Stone article and what happened on the Corner recently , " <PERSON>Bontempo</PERSON> said . 
<PERSON>Emily McLean</PERSON> , incoming editor-in-chief of the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Policy Review</ORGANIZATION> , said it is crucial that the editorial staff represent the general graduate expertise as a whole . 
" We have so many different prestigious graduate programs that do n't necessarily interact on a regular basis , " <PERSON>McLean</PERSON> said . " 
[ This is ] something that we could use to attract students from diff grad programs to give opinions on issue . " 
After <PERSON>Bontempo</PERSON> and <PERSON>McLean</PERSON> gave their opening remarks , conference attendees broke into groups to brainstorm about potential concerns and developing methods for next year 's issue . 
Discussion topics ranged from the role of infrastructure in having a safe campus to student alcohol consumption . 
After the discussion , <PERSON>Bontempo</PERSON> invited attendees to comment on the ideas of their groups . 
<PERSON>Rebecca Beeson</PERSON> , outgoing content director of the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Policy Review</ORGANIZATION> , said considering the student perspective and understanding of universities ' sexual assault policies would be beneficial to the issue . 
" It would be interesting to do some qualitative research . 
I have a feeling that would be very illuminating , " <PERSON>Beeson</PERSON> said . 
Bontempo then continued on to talk about a plan for putting together the issue next <DATE>April</DATE> . 
" This is all very tentative and in the works , " <PERSON>Bontempo</PERSON> said . 
" We initially had thought that the staff would be the entire grad community from across U.Va . " 
<PERSON>Bontempo</PERSON> also said the issue would have an advisory board comprised of administrators , alumni , faculty and students . 
" We thought this would be a good idea , because it would help demonstrate credibility for the publication , " <PERSON>Bontempo</PERSON> said . 
" I do n't think the advisory board would serve an editorial purpose . " 
<PERSON>Bontempo</PERSON> said during the submissions phase , the editorial board would accept from a broad range of people on the issue 's focus . 
" The content would focus solely on sexual assault policy at universities across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , " <PERSON>Bontempo</PERSON> said . 
" We are thinking about putting no limitations on submissions . 
Anyone who wanted to submit , I do n't really think we would put any limits on that . " 
Bontempo also said the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Policy Review</ORGANIZATION> plans to award monetary prizes for the top three submissions . 
" I do n't think with these kinds of awards it would be hard to get people to contribute , " <PERSON>Bontempo</PERSON> said . 
As the conference came to an end , <PERSON>Bontempo</PERSON> said this is just an outline of plans for the issue rather than a final blueprint . 
" This is just a general vision of what it would look like , " <PERSON>Bontempo</PERSON> said . 
" This is n't just VPR 's issue . 
This is the graduate community 's issue . "
