<DATE>Monday</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> 's chapter of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> announced its decision to take legal action against Rolling Stone magazine . 
In a statement , the chapter stated it plans " to pursue all available legal action against the magazine . " 
Such legal action will probably rest on a defamation or libel claim - that in its failure to properly fact-check its article " A Rape on Campus , " the magazine defamed the fraternity ( the legal avenues fraternities and their members can pursue have been explored in depth ) . 
It would be hard to argue that <PERSON>Sabrina Rubin Erdely</PERSON> , in her portrayal of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's chapter of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> , did not defame it . 
And suing a magazine that has defamed you is a logical step . 
But more important than what damages the fraternity may be owed is why this step matters for everyone else . 
After the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Journalism School</ORGANIZATION> 's review came out <DATE>Sunday</DATE> , <PERSON>Will Dana</PERSON> , managing editor of Rolling Stone , announced that all those who worked on <ORGANIZATION>Erdely</ORGANIZATION> 's piece would continue to work for Rolling Stone - including Erdely herself . 
Rolling Stone is not facing serious consequences in the aftermath of its egregiously bad reporting - as far as we know , its subscriptions and page views have not fallen ; no individuals are being held accountable ; and , though the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Journalism School</ORGANIZATION> 's review is fairly damning , it is hard to know whether the magazine 's reputation will suffer long-term damage . 
This is not to say the magazine can not ever again be treated as a reputable source of news . 
But the failures of this article are extreme . 
The most disheartening failure is that survivors of sexual assault may fear reporting or that their stories will be met with disbelief ( a problem that predates this article but was exacerbated by it ) . 
After Rolling Stone failed its readers so miserably , it must be clear both to that magazine and to all credible news sources how to approach reporting on sexual assault - something for which the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Journalism</ORGANIZATION> review provides guidelines . 
But <PERSON>Chris Cillizza</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> excellently sums up why a lack of accountability for Rolling Stone is , in his words , " terrible for journalism . " 
After seeing no accountability in the response to Rolling Stone 's failure , why would readers trust the journalists reporting on these issues at all ? 
For journalism , proper reporting on sexual assault and for sexual assault survivors themselves , Rolling Stone needs to see consequences beyond a comprehensive review of its mistakes . 
This brings us back to <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> 's lawsuit . 
The lawsuit is appropriate for what the fraternity went through as a result of this article - but it also appears to be one of the only ways left to hold this magazine accountable . 
Some may worry that a lawsuit would only create more fear for sexual assault survivors when coming forward with their stories - that not only will these stories be met with disbelief , but they could also be met with legal ramifications . 
But the legal ramifications here are for Rolling Stone , not <LOCATION>Jackie</LOCATION> ; and anything that can reinforce proper journalistic standards will , in the long run , be better for everyone . 
If other news media put out stories similar to " A Rape on Campus , " it is in everyone 's best interest for those stories to be correct . 
And if news media see possible litigation as a result of incorrect stories , there is a much higher likelihood they will avoid the mistakes Rolling Stone made . 
For <ORGANIZATION>Phi Psi</ORGANIZATION> , this lawsuit is right because of the damages the fraternity sustained . 
But it is right more generally because of the need for journalistic accountability in this situation .
