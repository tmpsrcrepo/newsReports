Will Brumas | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily The University</ORGANIZATION> has commenced an internal evaluation of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> to determine whether to extend her current contract . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> 's contract is set to expire <DATE>July 31 , 2016</DATE> . 
Board of Visitors Rector <PERSON>George Keith Martin</PERSON> said that while the consideration of <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> 's contract is now in a formal evaluation stage , this is only part of a more general , constant reassessment of her tenure . 
" Consistent with good board governance , the evaluation of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> president is a continuous , ongoing process , " <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said in an email . 
" We are currently in the midst of the formal evaluation period . " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> , who took office in <DATE>2010</DATE> as the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's eighth president , said the work and projects she has spearheaded are part of an ongoing process , and she would like to continue working with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community on important <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> opportunities . 
" I look forward to continuing to work with the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> , students , faculty , staff , parents , alumni and supporters on the many important opportunities ahead for this great institution , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said in an email . 
" My goal as president has been and will continue to be working to ensure that <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> remains one of the nation 's finest institutions of higher education , and striving not only to maintain but to enhance its excellence in teaching , research , patient care and public service . " 
Student referendums on <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> 's tenure have been by and large a mixed bag . 
Second-year College student <PERSON>Jackson Nell</PERSON> said he believes <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> has done her best in response to each of the challenges the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community has faced - from devoting top <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> resources to the search for second-year <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> to supporting the student body through the Rolling Stone crisis . 
" I think she catalyzed a much deserved conversation about the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's culture and the need to actively combat domestic and sexual violence , " <PERSON>Nell</PERSON> said . 
" I believe that her efforts to be actively present in our community through her emails and her working groups have fostered greater <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> attention to issues of domestic and sexual violence as well as issues regarding U.Va . 
's often troubling past regarding gender , socioeconomic and racial equality . " 
While <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> community has faced its fair share of traumatic and unsettling challenges over the last five years , <PERSON>Nell</PERSON> said he would n't expect <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> to face any significant challenges in extending her contract . 
" I think she has brought a ton of energy , increased transparency and greater administration-student dialogue to Grounds throughout her time here , " he said . 
" I hope that she is able to continue her efforts to make U.Va . 
the premier public university in this nation . " 
Other students , however , feel <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> has not done an adequate job serving the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
First-year College student <PERSON>Aethena Brooks</PERSON> said she does not believe <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> should return to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> after her contract ends . 
" I think in light of recent events , the way she 's handled the things that have happened ... I just do n't think she 's handled them well , " <PERSON>Brooks</PERSON> said . 
" I do n't feel that she 's a student advocate who supports the community . " 
Second-year College Student <PERSON>Zachary Ackerman</PERSON> said the way <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> continues to handle the sexual assault allegations made in the Rolling Stone article will shape his opinion on the effectiveness of the administration . 
" Being here for two years has n't given me the strongest opinion either way , " <PERSON>Ackerman</PERSON> said . 
" I feel that as students we do n't often see what the president does until moments like [ the release of the Rolling Stones article ] . 
I think someone should look into what happened regarding the article and the claims made in them . " 
<PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said he hopes to conclude the evaluation process no later than <DATE>June 30 , 2015</DATE> .
