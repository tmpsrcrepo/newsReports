<PERSON>Ken Cuccinelli</PERSON> has recently defended himself in his gubernatorial campaign against accusations that his positions are anti-woman by pointing to his involvement in starting the group Sexual Assault Facts and Education ( SAFE ) on Grounds at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> while he was a student . 
As vice president of One Less , an organization that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> created <DATE>last year</DATE> through the union of SAFE and Sexual Assault Peer Advocacy ( SAPA ) , I feel that his involvement in sexual assault prevention during his time at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> only makes his poor track record on women 's issues as a state senator , attorney general , and a gubernatorial candidate even more egregious . 
As attorney general , <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> was one of just three attorneys general in the entire country refuse to sign onto a letter encouraging <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act . 
This law is critical for protecting women from domestic abuse and sexual assault . 
The newly reauthorized law will provide <MONEY>$ 1.6 billion</MONEY> toward the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women and , according to the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Times , it provided <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> with <MONEY>$ 4.7 million</MONEY> in grants since <DATE>2010</DATE> . 
Cuccinelli claims on the campaign trail that he nearly witnessed an attempted sexual assault on Grounds , inspiring him to become an advocate . 
But then as a politician he refused to support one of the most successful prevention efforts against sexual violence in recent history . 
A second major discrepancy between <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> 's rhetoric about his college days and his political track record is his stance against abortion even in cases of rape and incest . 
He even supports so-called " personhood " legislation that states " life begins at fertilization . " 
This stance is problematic because not only would it outlaw abortion , even in cases of rape and incest , but medical experts have stated this legislation could be used to deny access to common forms of birth control , including the pill . 
Cuccinelli 's references to his participation in a vigil for survivors of sexual assault during his time at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> are an even harder pill to swallow given how he has spent his time in elected office in the years since . 
Having been involved in organizing the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> vigil for sexual assault survivors for the past two years , I know firsthand what an important and moving experience it is . 
It is beyond my comprehension how anyone involved in such an event could then build <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> 's resume of attacking women 's access to health care and ability to make their own health care decisions . 
<PERSON>Ken Cuccinelli</PERSON> 's comments about his role in founding SAFE make his career-long anti-women 's rights agenda even more saddening . 
He is intimately familiar with the challenges women face <DATE>today</DATE> - both on Grounds and throughout the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> - and yet he wants to stack the deck against us . 
His record speaks for itself . 
He has turned his back on these priorities as a state senator , attorney general , and now sadly , as he runs for governor . 
If <PERSON>Ken Cuccinelli</PERSON> really created the change that he claims he did at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , how could he fall so short of implementing that change in office ? 
<PERSON>Caroline Bartholomew</PERSON> is a fourth-year College student and the vice president of One Less .
