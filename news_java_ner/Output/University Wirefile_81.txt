<ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville City Police</ORGANIZATION> announced <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> they filed charges of rape and armed robbery against <PERSON>Montaret D. Davis</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Norfolk</LOCATION> for the <DATE>Aug. 26</DATE> assault of two <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> students . 
The attack occurred in the <LOCATION>Venable</LOCATION> area between 15th Street NW and Rugby Road , off of <LOCATION>Grady Avenue</LOCATION> , shortly after <TIME>4 a.m</TIME> . 
The perpetrator entered the female victim 's home and raped her while holding her male friend at gunpoint , police said . 
Police arrested the suspect after a <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> DNA database matched his DNA signature with samples taken from the victim 's bed sheets and from saliva left on a beer can in the victim 's home , <LOCATION>Charlottesville City</LOCATION> Police Sgt. <PERSON>Don Cambell</PERSON> said . 
The charges against <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> effectively ended both the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> departments ' month-long search for the perpetrator , police said . 
" The case is cleared by arrest and now we 're just trying to tie up loose ends , " <PERSON>Cambell</PERSON> said . 
" We 've got our man - the case is closed . " 
According to police , <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> entered the victim 's home and woke up the two victims at gunpoint . 
He then allegedly blindfolded the female and ordered the male , a friend who was spending the night after a party , not to look at him . 
After the rape , <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> reportedly forced the female to take a shower and stole money from both victims ' wallets . 
Later , he allegedly directed the victims into the kitchen , where he tried to comfort the female as he drank the beer , police said . 
<PERSON>Cambell</PERSON> said <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> fits the victims ' initial description of the perpetrator as a black male in his mid-20s , heavyset and between 5-foot-8 and 6-feet tall . 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> " is the man , " he said . 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> " matches the description , height , weight , everything , and DNA basically corroborates . " 
Additional charges against <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> include sodomy , attempted robbery , entering a dwelling at night and the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon . 
<PERSON>Cambell</PERSON> said <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> could face up to life imprisonment depending on his prior convictions and how a jury decides his case . 
Davis was charged at the <ORGANIZATION>Albemarle Joint Security Complex</ORGANIZATION> , where he has been detained for the <DATE>last 41 days</DATE> on a sentence for driving with a suspended/revoked license . 
Davis turned himself in for the six-month sentence just 14 hours after the rape occurred . 
<PERSON>Cambell</PERSON> said there was no reason to believe the victim and suspect previously knew each other . 
" There was no relationship whatsoever , " he said . 
" He was just a stranger who broke into the house that night and raped the victim . " 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> ' DNA signature originally was obtained after he was convicted of malicious wounding in <LOCATION>South Hampton</LOCATION> <DATE>three years ago</DATE> . 
However , due to a backlog of DNA signatures , <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> ' DNA was not entered into the state database and not compared to crime scene evidence until yesterday . 
<PERSON>Cambell</PERSON> said the suspect 's arrest was largely a result of luck and scientific efforts . 
" We 've just got to be thankful for modern technology because that 's what did it for us , " he said . 
The state lab " is constantly adding signatures into the database , " <PERSON>Cambell</PERSON> said . 
" When they put [ <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> ' signature ] in they got a hit . " 
Inter-Fraternity Council President <PERSON>Wes Kaupinen</PERSON> said safety concerns at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> were well-handled thanks to broad participation . 
" The fact that the [ alleged ] culprit was caught was the result of a tremendous effort from the police , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , the students and the community at large , " <PERSON>Kaupinen</PERSON> said .
