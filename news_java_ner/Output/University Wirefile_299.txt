The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has fought unjust wars and practiced immoral acts formed under the guise of a " war on terror . " 
But most of all , the campaign has wreaked havoc in regions such as <LOCATION>South Asia</LOCATION> and damaged all possible chances for peace and prosperity . 
The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration 's armed support for the despotic Nepalese monarchy and the autocratic Sri Lankan government has resulted in bloody , anti-democratic campaigns of slaughter in the two nations . 
In addition , its use of incentives for <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> has undermined future cooperation between the two rivals and affirmed <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> support for regimes which blatantly flout global non-proliferation regulations . 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military support for the power-hungry Nepalese monarchy has killed 13,000 in the last decade . 
It has armed and trained <ORGANIZATION>King Gyanendra</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Royal Nepalese Army</ORGANIZATION> , which regularly resorts to detention , torture and extrajudicial killings of citizens and hundreds of political leaders . 
Although the <ORGANIZATION>United States</ORGANIZATION> suspended " lethal aid " after <PERSON>Gyanendra</PERSON> sacked the government and assumed direct power in <DATE>2005</DATE> , it still provides bullet proof vests and jeeps to assist in this mass murder , according to <ORGANIZATION>Amnesty International</ORGANIZATION> . 
This has all been done in the name of preventing the opposing Maoist rebels to take over the government . 
However , this " anti-terror campaign " has allowed <PERSON>Gyanendra</PERSON> to abolish a constitutional monarchy and brutally crackdown on political parties and civilians . 
This blind dedication to rooting out terrorists is undermining the Nepalese political process . 
Just this week , opposition protests resulted in three civilian deaths in the hands of royalist forces . 
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has also allied with the <LOCATION>Sri Lankan</LOCATION> government in helping it unleash its own campaign of rape and murder against its Tamil population . 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military cooperation includes the training of brutal Sri Lankan security forces as well as the approval of <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> made military equipment from third parties such as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> engined Israeli Kfir jets . 
This violates the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Leahy Law</ORGANIZATION> which " prohibits the training of any foreign military personnel known to have committed human rights abuses . " 
While it is true that the <ORGANIZATION>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</ORGANIZATION> , or " Tamil Tigers , " are the most successful and violent terrorist group in the world , the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has banned the <ORGANIZATION>LTTE</ORGANIZATION> but has neither condemned the government 's equally gross human rights violations nor halted military assistance . 
For instance , when tsunami aid was to be delivered to <LOCATION>Sri Lanka</LOCATION> recently , the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> did not protest the government 's inhumane bypass of aid to affected Tamil areas . 
While terrorist groups do not deserve aid , there is no reason to bypass the entire Tamil population , a majority of whom do not even condone the radical Tigers . 
The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government 's siding with the government also gives it no incentive to cooperate in the recent international negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION>Tigers</ORGANIZATION> which have reached their lowest point in years . 
The United States should act responsibly and facilitate a political compromise between the government and the <ORGANIZATION>LTTE</ORGANIZATION> instead of letting its obsession with terrorism result in a near-breakdown of civil war . 
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has also compromised global nonproliferation records in its dealings with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> . 
For starters , the same year the A.Q. Khan nuclear black market network was discovered to be run out of <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> , the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> designated <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> the prestigious " major non-NATO ally " status -- a token for its counterterrorism cooperation . 
In doing so , the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has placed counterterrorism cooperation of one nation over wider global nonproliferation . 
The civilian nuclear deal with <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is no better , considering that gas centrifuges for <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> 's nuclear program originated from the same AQ Khan network . 
The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> has also thwarted possible peace endeavors between the two powers due to its terrorism agenda . 
The possible pipeline between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> , which would greatly enhance cooperation between the two regional powers , is despised by <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> thanks to <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> 's terrorist background . 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> has tried to lure the two nations away from the pipeline by making them compete for <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> incentives like the nuclear deal , thereby facilitating antagonism . 
This , according to the <ORGANIZATION>Financial Times</ORGANIZATION> , is the worst possible moment to do so since bilateral cooperation is unusually high and the <LOCATION>Kashmir</LOCATION> issue is the closest to being resolved . 
Once again blinded by terrorism , the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is refusing to support a pipeline which symbolizes potential cooperation between two nuclear powers which have fought three wars . 
No one denies that terrorism is a major issue , and one that needs to be tackled urgently . 
But arming rogue regimes with gross human rights records and preventing the resolution of key regional disputes is certainly not right way to go about it . 
If the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> continues to pursue a one-track mind approach to combating terrorism , <LOCATION>South Asia</LOCATION> will descend into a land of civil war and nuclear destruction .
