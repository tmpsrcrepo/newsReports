Students unveiled the Handprint Project this week , a campaign aimed to curb sexual assault on fraternity bid night . 
The project seeks to educate students about sexual assault prevention and intervention and is co-sponsored by Democracy for <LOCATION>America Charlottesville</LOCATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Honor Committee</ORGANIZATION> , One-in-Four and One Less . 
As of <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> , the online petition associated with the campaign had achieved 1,380 of its goal of 2,000 signatures . 
The campaign encourages brothers at each fraternity to pledge their role as active bystanders by stamping their handprint in blue on a large poster . 
Fraternities will display the poster with all brothers ' handprints at their fraternity house <DATE>Saturday</DATE> as a reminder for brothers to remain vigilant . 
" Every house will have that physical representation of the brothers ' commitment to bystander intervention , " student-organizer <PERSON>Katie Cole</PERSON> , a fourth-year College student , said . 
" I 'm really impressed with how the community has responded to this project . " 
<PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , director of sexual and domestic violence services at the <ORGANIZATION>University Women 's Center</ORGANIZATION> , said bystander intervention has the greatest potential to reduce sexual assault . " 
[ The <ORGANIZATION>Hand Print Project</ORGANIZATION> ] is their way to say ' I 'm a Greek , and I 'm not afraid to say something , ' " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
Historically , the days following bid night have seen a spike in reports of sexual assault , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
Leaders behind the project hope the Handprint Project will help to combat this trend . 
" There 's kind of a culture of feeling entitled to women [ at fraternities ] , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
" The reason is there 's always a lot of drinking on bid night . " 
<PERSON>Cole</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> culture needs to change to create a real difference . 
" It 's such a big night of chaos , and a lot of people do n't know each other , " <PERSON>Cole</PERSON> said . 
" In the confusion , horrible things like sexual assault can occur . " 
Incoming <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Tommy Reid</PERSON> , current vice president of membership , said fraternity brothers hope this project will allow them to leverage their presence in the community to affect change . 
" What we 're doing is ensuring that each person is not just looking out for himself , " said <PERSON>Reid</PERSON> , a third-year College student and member of <ORGANIZATION>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</ORGANIZATION> fraternity . 
The issue of sexual assault on college campuses received increased attention <DATE>last Wednesday</DATE> when President <PERSON>Barack Obama</PERSON> signed a presidential memorandum creating a task force to combat the issue . 
The memorandum responds to a recent <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> report showing that women at college are more likely to be sexually assaulted than anyone else in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will also host a conference on sexual misconduct on college campuses in <DATE>February</DATE> .
