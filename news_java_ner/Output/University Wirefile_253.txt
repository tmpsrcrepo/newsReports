Each year , there are about 3 million unintended pregnancies in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> -- and about half of them happen to women who are using a regular method of contraception . 
Many women experience anxiety after if a condom breaks , she misses a pill or she has sex when she did n't plan to -- or want to . 
However , there is another option for women who experience contraceptive failure or unplanned sex -- emergency contraception , sometimes called the " morning-after pill . " 
It 's a short , higher dose of the same hormones found in regular birth control pills , and women can get it to have on hand just in case there is an emergency . 
National Back Up Your Birth Control Day was <DATE>earlier this week</DATE> and was part of a campaign to encourage women to have <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> in case of contraceptive failure or unwanted or unprotected sex . 
Many women still do n't know about <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> or how to get it . 
Many do n't know they can get it in advance , which is important for women to know about <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> . 
Why do n't more women know about this option ? 
First , some doctors are n't talking about it . 
Studies have shown that less than one in four obstetricians , gynecologists and family practice physicians discuss <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> when they counsel their patients about birth control . 
Calls to some doctors ' offices inquiring about emergency contraception often yield misleading information about it -- for instance , statements like " it 's not available here . " 
Worse , when a woman does get a prescription , a pharmacist might refuse to fill it for " moral reasons . " 
And legislation to further restrict access to emergency contraception is still in the works . 
Just recently , the <ORGANIZATION>James Madison University</ORGANIZATION> administration prohibited the sale of <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> in their student health center ( They have since lifted the ban ) . 
It 's shocking that we have a back-up birth control method that can reduce the risk of getting pregnant by up to <PERCENT>89 percent</PERCENT> and it 's so underutilized . 
In fact , it 's been estimated that widespread awareness and use of emergency contraception could prevent as many as half of the unintended pregnancies in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> each year . 
The birth control pill and other contraceptive methods such as condoms are readily available , but none are one hundred percent effective . 
Only abstinence works all the time , but women who choose not to abstain from sex deserve access to all contraceptive options . 
Emergency contraception needs to be taken soon after unprotected sex ( not more than 120 hours ) , and the sooner , the better . 
So , after an incident of unprotected sex , the clock starts ticking . 
Instead of having to find a doctor , get an appointment , wait for the prescription to be filled -- provided that pharmacy will fill it -- women could already have <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> on hand and avoid wasting precious hours trying to get it . 
Some people think that making <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> more easily available will lead women to be irresponsible or promiscuous even though most women use <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> only as a back-up method . 
Some politicians and anti-choice extremists will stop at nothing to deny women information , education and access to emergency contraception , even women who are survivors of rape or incest . 
However , <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> is safe and effective and reduces the need for abortions . 
Surely both sides of the political spectrum can support this idea . 
The fact is that emergency contraception is birth control , pure and simple . 
The only radical thing about it is that it 's not being used . 
VOX : Voices for Planned Parenthood is working hard to raise awareness about emergency contraception and make <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> more available to students . 
VOX encourages all women to get <ORGANIZATION>EC</ORGANIZATION> . 
Emergency contraception is the best way to prevent unintended pregnancy in case of rape , incest or contraceptive failure and is part of basic medical care that should be accessible to all women .
