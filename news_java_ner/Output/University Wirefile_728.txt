The <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern Leadership Council</ORGANIZATION> hosted Arab-American comedian and philanthropist <PERSON>Maysoon Zayid</PERSON> <DATE>Monday</DATE> . 
Zayid was invited by the group as the speaker for the last event of <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern</ORGANIZATION> cultural month . 
MELC Treasurer <PERSON>Abdulla Jastaniah</PERSON> , a second-year College student , said the group wanted to invite someone who could represent <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern</ORGANIZATION> culture , while also being relatable to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community as a whole . 
" We 've gone through so much this past year as a community , and to bring someone who is not only a minority , but also someone that deals with a disability , we hoped that she could share some of her experiences with us , " <PERSON>Jastaniah</PERSON> said . 
" By listening to her laugh at herself and tell jokes about being disabled , for being unfortunate , but loving her life , maybe we can learn to laugh at ourselves too . " 
Zayid is a unique representative of many minority groups . 
She is a Palestinian , disabled , female comedian . 
She gave a Ted Talk in <DATE>2014</DATE> entitled " I 've got 99 problems ... palsy is just one , " which served as a loose basis for her talk at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Zayid has also been featured on the Queen <PERSON>Latifah</PERSON> Show and You Do n't Mess with the Zohan . 
" In the oppression Olympics , I 'd win the gold medal , " <PERSON>Zayid</PERSON> said . 
She began her performance describing her experience growing up as one of the only Arabs in a small town in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> . 
Zayid made numerous gibes at the many stereotypes pertaining to disability , Arabs and women . 
While her performance followed a similar outline to her original <PERSON>Ted Talk</PERSON> , Zayid also played upon some well-known associations to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
This included her long held admiration for <PERSON>Dave Matthews</PERSON> and the common notion of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> as a Southern institution . 
Throughout all the comedic irreverence , however , Zayid still maintained her original purpose in coming to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> - reaching out and inspiring groups on Grounds . 
She was intent on emphasizing the potential of college students to positively change the course of the world . 
" The world is broken but we can fix it by saying no to violence , to oppression , to discrimination , " <PERSON>Zayid</PERSON> said . 
" Your voice is a weapon , so use it . " 
Zayid runs a non-profit organization for Palestinian children called <ORGANIZATION>Maysoon</ORGANIZATION> 's Kids , and commented on the current state of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
She said the best remedy for the tensions is a two state-solution - typically an unpopular thought in the current discourse on the issue . 
She noted many Palestinians already work in close proximity to Israelis as housemen and maids , among other professions , so to allow them to be considered equals in Palestine would not prove that difficult . 
Paralleling this issue , which highlights her belief there should be equal rights for all , Zayid applies a similar sentiment to the current situation most colleges are facing . 
Many minorities on college campuses around the country have long been unaccounted for - and <PERSON>Zayid</PERSON> said she believes this must change . 
College is a time to cultivate community and equality , something essential to future leadership , she said . 
" From this moment forward , at this university we need to take care of each other and in order to take care of each other we need to be treated as equals , " <PERSON>Zayid</PERSON> said . 
" If one of us is hurt , the entire community is hurt and as a community we need to stand together against the oppression because otherwise what 's the point of being leaders of the future ? " 
She explained the problem of academic dishonesty , favoritism , oppression to women and rape have not truly gotten worse ; it is only that the communication of such events has proliferated . 
" I think with the power that students have with social media , they 're standing up and saying enough is enough and that the backlash against college is n't because its gotten worse , its because we 've gotten more empowered saying enough is enough , " <PERSON>Zayid</PERSON> said . 
Outgoing MELC President <PERSON>Mariam Yaktieen</PERSON> , a fourth-year College student , said while Zayid embodies many groups , she is not the " golden ticket for minorities . " 
" We found her to be a well-rounded and well-respected Arab-American comedian who we believed would be a great addition to our <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern Cultural Month</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Yaktieen</PERSON> said . 
" I hope that MELC was able to hold events this <ORGANIZATION>MEC</ORGANIZATION> month that reached out to many groups on grounds and not just Middle Easterners . "
