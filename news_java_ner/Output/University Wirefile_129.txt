A week ago I received a forwarded e-mail from a friend of mine at <ORGANIZATION>James Madison University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The message was somewhat of a response to the second school shooting in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> in as many weeks . 
The body of the message listed an abundance of reasons why children " kill strangers , classmates or even themselves . " 
The e-mail was obviously written by a conservative , as it bemoaned the lack of religion in public schools and then heaped a chunk of blame on the media for " movies that promote profanity , violence and illicit sex , ... music that encourages rape , drugs , murder , suicide and satanic themes ... " At this point , I got a bit agitated . 
You see , I like violent music . 
I 've listened to music that mentions all the above elements . 
My music collection has a large number of particularly morally depraved CDs . 
I own three <PERSON>Marilyn Manson</PERSON> albums . 
I 've got several recordings by the Lords of Acid , whose selection of song topics center on sex , with a bit of drugs thrown in . 
On my desk right now is a CD from <ORGANIZATION>DJ Tron</ORGANIZATION> , the cover of which depicts a severed hand . 
I have a reason why I listen to such music . 
It was prompted by high school . 
We all know the intense emotions that flow through the veins of any typical teenager . 
With the build up of stress that accompanies seven classes a day , five days a week and various extra-curricular activities , it 's a wonder anyone survives the four years preceding college . 
And yet , we do find a way to deal with it . 
My way was with music . 
Some people like soothing music that calms aggression . 
I like aggressive music that wrings the anger out of me like you would squeeze a sponge . 
Naturally , I get angry anytime someone starts talking about how the music I like is such a horrible influence on children . 
I 'm proof it is n't . 
After a tragedy like the one in <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> this past month , it is easy to see why some people begin passing around the types of mail like the one I received . 
Tragedies provoke people to look for reasons why they happened . 
Citizens try to rationalize the irrational . 
They hope to prevent such tragedies from ever occurring again , and they come up with what seems like a good idea on how to do so . 
But what really bothers me about the events that follow a school shooting is the idea that the actions of one or two teenagers are grounds for nationwide changes . 
Following a school shooting , various talking heads , each with a political agenda , pop out of the woodwork explaining why their solution is so much better than everyone else 's proposed solution . 
And because of the heightened attention to such issues brought on by intense media coverage , these pundits have a large percent of the American public as an audience . 
It 's called demagoguery . 
Essentially , it 's taking a small event and magnifying it to national importance . 
It works , and it should n't . 
<PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON> employed it while lobbying for his tax cut , showcasing several families that would be aided by the tax cut . 
If his proposed legislation is good for one carefully screened family , it 's got to be good for the rest of us , right ? 
In the aftermath of school shootings , all sorts of idea are paraded out . 
A school security guard shot the alleged gunman in the second <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> shooting , so armed guards should be put in all schools . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Columbine</ORGANIZATION> assailants listened to violent hard rock music , so we should hold record companies accountable . 
Each of these students had access to guns , so we should make guns less available . 
Nationwide action must be based on nationwide problems . 
And as much as political activists would like us to believe they are , school shootings are not a nationwide problem . 
Letting such events dictate the way we run the country is silly . 
When the country discusses such matters as gun control and religion in schools , it must be done from a platform free of the raw emotion stirred up by tragedy . 
Likewise , we must be sure that the choices we make are done in the best interest of the country , not in response to the actions of a few individuals . 
Our nation 's government works slowly for a reason . 
Mistakes at a national level are much more expensive to fix than we can imagine . 
Also , politicians have to consider how their actions will affect the 280 million people of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , not just high school students in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> . 
There are no easy solutions to any problem that effects the entire nation , and anyone who proposes one is n't thinking in national terms .
