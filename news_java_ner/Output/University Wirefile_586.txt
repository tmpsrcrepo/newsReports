The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> chapter of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity then voluntarily suspended its Fraternal Organization Agreement with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , thereby stopping all fraternity activities . 
" We remain ready and willing to assist with the fair and swift pursuit of justice , wherever that may lead , and steadfast in our resolve to ensure that nothing like this can happen , ever on our Grounds , " the chapter said in a statement . 
In response to the article , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students held rallies to show their support for victims and to voice their anger with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual misconduct policies . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Middle Eastern and Islamic Student Association</ORGANIZATION> held a rally in the Amphitheatre <DATE>Nov. 20</DATE> titled " Stand Up Against Rape Culture " which attracted more than 1,000 community members . 
First-year College student <PERSON>Maria Dehart</PERSON> lead a " Slut Walk " <DATE>Nov. 21</DATE> . 
Protesters marched around Grounds , ending up at <ORGANIZATION>Peabody Hall</ORGANIZATION> , where they were addressed by <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Students Allen Groves</ORGANIZATION> . 
Protests spilled into the following weekend .

Campus fraternities voluntarily suspended social activities for the upcoming weekend following the release of the article . 
On <DATE>Nov. 22</DATE> , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> released a statement announcing the suspension of all fraternal organizations and social activities until <DATE>Jan. 9</DATE> . 
" Our challenges will extend beyond this <DATE>weekend</DATE> , " the statement said . 
Student leaders held a press conference for local and national media <DATE>Nov. 24</DATE> to discuss student efforts against sexual assault . 
Student leaders such as Student Council President <PERSON>Jalen Ross</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Tommy Reid</PERSON> , One Less President <PERSON>Ashley Brown</PERSON> and One in Four President <PERSON>Brian Head</PERSON> each gave statements . 
Later that night , the English , <ORGANIZATION>American Studies</ORGANIZATION> and French faculties and student organizations One Less and One in Four held discussions for students to express their opinions on sexual assault on Grounds . 
At a special meeting to address the complaints in the Rolling Stone article and <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual misconduct policy more broadly , the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> passed a zero-tolerance policy on <DATE>Nov. 25</DATE> . 
President <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> held a meeting with students <DATE>Dec. 1</DATE> to discuss the administration 's plans to address rape , alcohol abuse and the dangers of fraternity parties . 
These plans included faculty-wide sexual assault education ; collaboration with Greek organizations , ADAPT and the <ORGANIZATION>Gordie Center</ORGANIZATION> ; security personnel to monitor the Corner and Wertland Street areas on weekends ; and funding to hire another trauma counselor for the Women 's Center . 
On <DATE>Dec. 5</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> chapter of <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> released a statement indicating several factual discrepancies between the allegations made in the Rolling Stone article and an internal investigation . 
The chapter noted that no member of the fraternity worked at the Aquatic and <ORGANIZATION>Fitness Center</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>2012</DATE> as the article described . 
Records also showed there was no social function at the fraternity house on <DATE>Sept. 28 , 2012</DATE> . 
" Our Chapter 's pledging and initiation periods , as required by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> , take place solely in the <DATE>spring</DATE> semester and not in the fall semester , " the statement said . 
" We document the initiation of new members at the end of each <DATE>spring</DATE> . 
Moreover , no ritualized sexual assault is part of our pledging or initiation process . 
This notion is vile , and we vehemently refute this claim . " 
The same day , Rolling Stone released its own statement , saying there were numerous discrepancies with the article and noting that their trust in <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> was " misplaced . " 
Rolling Stone later updated their statement to extend their apology and said the blame lies with the magazine , not with <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> . 
" We have come to the conclusion that we were mistaken in honoring <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's request to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account , " the statement said . 
The updated statement also detailed the discrepancies in the story as revealed by the <ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> statement and a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post article . 
The Post reported that after speaking with the three friends of <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's who are mentioned in the article as seeing her on the night of her alleged assault - " Cindy , " " Randall " and " Andy " in the article - that many of the details did not match what she said on the <TIME>night</TIME> in question . 
Jackie 's three friends , third-year Engineering student <PERSON>Ryan Duffin</PERSON> , third-year <ORGANIZATION>Commerce</ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON>Alex Stock</PERSON> and third-year Architecture student <PERSON>Kathryn Hendley</PERSON> , said that <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's date took her to his fraternity house because he needed to pick something up , and that he then brought her to his room and forced her to perform oral sex on five men . 
Other reports have found that the name <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> provided friends of the man is not someone who ever enrolled at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
In the aftermath , Rolling Stone asked the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism</ORGANIZATION> to review the editorial and reporting process of its article . 
The effort is being spearheaded by the Dean <PERSON>Steven Coll</PERSON> and Dean of Student Affairs <PERSON>Sheila Coronel</PERSON> . 
" Rolling Stone has agreed to publish our report in its entirety , without editing , on its website , as well as substantial excerpts in the magazine , " <PERSON>Coronel</PERSON> said . 
Sullivan announced <DATE>Dec. 8</DATE> she had formed an Ad <ORGANIZATION>Hoc Group on University Climate and Culture</ORGANIZATION> to develop safety initiatives on Grounds . 
The committee , which has held two meetings since its inception , has three primary areas of focus : changing the student culture , developing sexual assault prevention policies , and improving administrative and institutional response . 
Achieving these goals will involve changes to Greek life , improving bystander training and peer education , and committing to a host of safety initiatives , the release said . 
Several student groups worked to craft a series of policy proposals for the administration , the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> , and other student groups as part of an effort to combat sexual assault . 
Recommendations include mandated Women and Gender studies classes , funding for legal counsel for survivors of sexual assault , trauma training for police , and University-sponsored alternatives to <ORGANIZATION>Block Party</ORGANIZATION> . 
The report outlined nine steps for the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> and seven steps for the administration to diminish gender-based violence and rape culture on Grounds . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> held another special meeting <DATE>Dec. 19</DATE> to discuss ongoing efforts to combat sexual assault . 
At the meeting Rector <PERSON>George Martin</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community had been victim to " drive-by journalism " in Rolling Stone and vowed strong , measured actions to continue to combat sexual assault . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> also discussed <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> 's proposals which she outlined with the Ad <ORGANIZATION>Hoc Committee</ORGANIZATION> , and heard from <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Michael Gibson</PERSON> and <PERSON>Apalla Chopra</PERSON> , a legal representative from O'Melveny and <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> - the firm tasked by <ORGANIZATION>Attorney General Mark Herring</ORGANIZATION> to examine the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's handling of sexual misconduct cases . 
Many reforms are still in the works , including revised fraternal organization agreements with all Greek organizations , which were expected by the end of the calendar year and will be implemented before the organizations are removed from their suspension . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> also said other student groups ' contractual agreements with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> would likely be reworked . 
" How we answer these questions is not about protecting the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's reputation - it is about doing the right thing , " President <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said in her <DATE>Dec. 1</DATE> press conference . 
" We will not be doing business as usual in <DATE>spring 2015</DATE> . "
