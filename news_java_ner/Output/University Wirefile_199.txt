The <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Inter-Fraternity Council</ORGANIZATION> will officially recognize fewer greek organizations than in years past after they dropped two of their affiliated fraternities last week . 
Low membership numbers prompted <ORGANIZATION>Sigma Alpha Mu</ORGANIZATION> alumni to revoke the charter of the fraternity 's university chapter , according to <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Ryan Ewalt</PERSON> . 
" The alumni decided it was time to close down the house and refocus their efforts on starting brand new , " <PERSON>Ewalt</PERSON> said . 
Although the decision was made in the <DATE>spring</DATE> , it did not officially go into effect until the first day of classes last week . 
" I had a conversation with the [ <ORGANIZATION>Sigma Alpha Mu</ORGANIZATION> ] president last <DATE>spring</DATE> , who indicated that they wanted to continue as an <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> fraternity , " said <PERSON>Aaron Laushway</PERSON> , associate dean of students and director of fraternity and sorority life . 
" The Office [ of Fraternity and Sorority Life ] has received no paperwork from them as we enter into the new academic year , so they have no relationship with the university . " 
Also missing from this year 's <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> roster is <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Delta Phi</ORGANIZATION> , who missed the fall semester deadline to complete the university-mandated <ORGANIZATION>Fraternal Organization Agreement</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Ewalt</PERSON> said . 
The <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> , now comprised of 30 social fraternities , is one of the university 's four greek governing councils . 
The university requires that each fraternity complete several components of the annual FOA . 
One section includes responses to presentations on hazing , drugs , alcohol , personal safety/sexual assault and discrimination , <PERSON>Ewalt</PERSON> said . 
Alpha <ORGANIZATION>Delta Phi</ORGANIZATION> only completed the alcohol and drug requirements , and is therefore no longer recognized by the university or the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> , he added . 
Lack of university and <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> affiliation means a number of things for a fraternity , one of which is exclusion from informal recruitment in the <DATE>fall</DATE> and formal recruitment in the <DATE>spring</DATE> , <PERSON>Laushway</PERSON> said . 
Both <ORGANIZATION>Sigma Alpha Mu</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Delta Phi</ORGANIZATION> will be unable to attend the weekly <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> President 's <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> meetings , where many fraternity policies are voted on , <PERSON>Ewalt</PERSON> said . 
Non-affiliated fraternities also are excluded from practices such as " Party Patrol , " the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> 's method of policing its own events to prevent the involvement of university or <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> , police . 
" We police ourselves so others do n't have to , " <PERSON>Ewalt</PERSON> said . 
" We can take care of the problem and the police are never involved . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Sigma Alpha Mu</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Delta Phi</ORGANIZATION> also are excluded from access to the university server to maintain a Web page and from participation in intramural sports as a fraternity , <PERSON>Laushway</PERSON> said . 
While the future of <ORGANIZATION>Sigma Alpha Mu</ORGANIZATION> remains uncertain , the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> has outlined conditions by which <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Delta Phi</ORGANIZATION> can become a member of the <ORGANIZATION>IFC</ORGANIZATION> in time to participate in <DATE>spring</DATE> rush events , <PERSON>Laushway</PERSON> said . 
Alpha <ORGANIZATION>Delta Phi</ORGANIZATION> must complete the three missing FOA educational requirements by the end of this semester in order to be eligible to participate in formal rush . 
In addition , they must complete all five FOA educational requirements for this academic year , <PERSON>Ewalt</PERSON> added . 
" We are definitely working to get [ the requirements ] done , and we are going to complete all eight by the end of this semester , " said fourth-year College student <PERSON>Luke Giannini</PERSON> , former <ORGANIZATION>Alpha Delta Phi</ORGANIZATION> president . 
" It is something we want to get done and put behind us . "
