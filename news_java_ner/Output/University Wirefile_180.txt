Last week marked the first time in the last hundred years that a woman has been brought up on polygamy charges in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> . 
The arrest is valid and overdue and should be part of a broader investigation into polygamy in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , or at least into the abuse and neglect that attends it in a number of polygamist communities . 
The arrested woman is accused of abetting bigamy and illegal sex because , according to an <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> report , she told her 16 year-old sister that God wanted her to marry the woman 's 36 year-old husband and that if she did not , she would " burn in hell " ( " <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> woman charged with aiding and abetting polygamy , " <DATE>Oct. 14</DATE> ) . 
Her husband also is accused of illegal sex . 
This case is made even more pertinent by its location and timing . 
The accused couple is part of the <ORGANIZATION>Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</ORGANIZATION> , an offshoot of the Mormon church ( which outlawed polygamy in <DATE>1890</DATE> and ex-communicated all bigamists ) . 
The Fundamentalist Church membership is concentrated in a community on the <ORGANIZATION>Utah-Arizona</ORGANIZATION> border and , according to an AP report , is alleged to be involved in rape , domestic abuse and welfare fraud ( " Polygamy controversy roils <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> race , " <DATE>Oct. 14</DATE> ) . 
Currently , an independent candidate for <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> governor , <PERSON>Richard Mahony</PERSON> , is running political ads comparing Fundamentalist Church 's <LOCATION>Colorado City</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>AZ</LOCATION> community to <PERSON>David Koresh</PERSON> 's <LOCATION>Waco</LOCATION> compund -- claiming that their crimes are " worse than Waco " -- and claiming that his opponents will be too soft on the group . 
While this candidate 's statements are a bit dramatic , the problem of multiple marriages , and the often attendant abuse , ought to lead to more arrests . 
There have been multiple reports in recent years of young women -- 15 and 16 years old -- escaping polygamist communities and telling of the coercion that happens there . 
One 15 year-old who left the <ORGANIZATION>Fundamentalist Church</ORGANIZATION> community in <DATE>2001</DATE> said that she did so because she was afraid that she would soon be married to a man twice her age -- this was after her 18 year-old boyfriend was expelled for his relationship with her . 
At the same time , another 15 year-old was suing in a <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> court to be allowed to leave the community and a 14 year-old 's older sister was claiming that the younger girl was being held there against her will ( " Teen-age girls flee Fundamentalist sect to avoid polygamy , " Star-Tribune , <DATE>Aug. 24 , 2001</DATE> ) . 
In response to <PERSON>Mahony</PERSON> 's allegations , <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> Attorney General and Democratic candidate <PERSON>Janet Napolitano</PERSON> points to one arrest made in <LOCATION>Colorado City</LOCATION> and adds that the <ORGANIZATION>Church</ORGANIZATION> 's secrecy makes investigation difficult . 
If the girls ' accounts are any indication of typical behavior within the <ORGANIZATION>Fundamentalist Church</ORGANIZATION> , the lack of further charges is frustrating at best , negligent at worst . 
It is one thing -- albeit an objectionable and illegal one -- for a group of consenting adults to choose to call themselves " married " and raise their half-siblings together . 
It is another thing altogether to compel teenage girls to marry men their father 's age . 
Avoiding prosecution , and denying these young girls the protection the law ought to give them when their parents -- numerous as they may be -- fail to protect them , is inexcusable . 
One pro-polygamy Web site ( www.polygamy.com ) , which provides a page for families to advertise for additional wives , lists the " benefits " women receive from polygamy . 
They claim that polygamy " extends practical security to a woman . 
She need n't worry about losing her husband and income as she loses her looks , because if her husband is attracted by a younger woman , he does n't even have to think about leaving his wife . " 
This repulsive claim suggests that marriage is simply about physical attraction and money , despite the fact that one " plural wife " told Sports Illustrated , " We 're not in this for romance , sex , money or status . 
We 're in it for the spirituality " ( " Be careful what you wish for , " <DATE>Feb. 16</DATE> ) . 
The use of spirituality as rationalization is hard to swallow when polygamy is promoted as a way to -- technically -- avoid charges of infidelity and statutory rape . 
An even more repulsive " advantage " is that , " polygamy removes or reduces the seduction of innocent young women . 
If a man promises to marry her , he can not use his existing marriage as an excuse for not fulfilling a promise . " 
This both assumes that abuse is only possible outside the bounds of marriage and denies the fact that girls who are coerced into marriage by their older sisters are , in fact , being preyed upon . 
Polygamy is illegal throughout the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> . 
It might be a largely harmless crime , were it not for the abuse and coercion it often entails . 
The arrest of a woman for her role in this abuse and coercion is timely and significant . 
It represents a refusal to treat women simply as victims in this system , and has the capacity to motivate other " plural wives " to take responsibility for the mistreatment of the real victims -- the young women of their community .
