She must have wanted to give up at least a thousand times . 
For <PERSON>Adrienne Ortolano</PERSON> , the 11 years she waited to bring her rapist to justice probably were filled with anger , frustration and pain . 
But somehow , she found the strength to keep believing that justice would be served . 
And then one day , it was . 
This <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , <PERSON>Adrienne Ortolano</PERSON> will speak at the annual Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night Rally</ORGANIZATION> , co-sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>National Organization for Women</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>University Women 's Center</ORGANIZATION> . 
Each year , the event is held to raise awareness about sexual assault and to demand the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and the community continue to fight against it . 
The selection of <PERSON>Ortolano</PERSON> as the keynote speaker -- whether consciously or unconsciously -- emphasizes the crucial element of victim support in the battle against sexual assault . 
In <DATE>1986</DATE> , 19-year-old <PERSON>Alex Kelly</PERSON> raped 16-year-old <PERSON>Ortolano</PERSON> in the back seat of a Jeep . 
Ortolano reported the rape to the police and <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> was arrested . 
When the date of his trial arrived in <DATE>1987</DATE> , however , <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> failed to appear in court . 
In fact , he had fled to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> with the help of his parents , and he lived there -- mostly in luxurious ski lodges -- for eight years . 
But <PERSON>Ortolano</PERSON> refused to accept the fact that her rapist might escape the law . 
For eight years , she helped the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> search for <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> . 
In <DATE>1995</DATE> , he turned himself in to the Swiss police . 
And in <DATE>July 1998</DATE> , he was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the rape . 
He now awaits trial for a second rape that allegedly was committed only a few days after <PERSON>Ortolano</PERSON> 's . 
Many believe that had <PERSON>Ortolano</PERSON> not come forward with her accusation , the second victim would have remained silent . 
After all , <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> was a well-known , popular and wealthy member of the community . 
In fact , before <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> fled the country , public support seemed overwhelmingly in his favor . 
For either victim , speaking out took an enormous amount of courage . 
Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> recognizes the role of the community in empowering sexual assault victims to speak out and fight like <PERSON>Ortolano</PERSON> did . 
The annual event actually has three parts . 
The first is a rally that takes place on the Downtown Mall , with speakers and music . 
When the rally concludes , the march begins , starting at the Downtown Mall and continuing down Main Street and Rugby Road and ending up at the <LOCATION>Rotunda</LOCATION> . 
It is this portion that usually garners the most attention -- a mob of women and men chanting " Women unite/Take Back the Night " or " No matter how we dress/No matter where we go/Yes means yes and no means no " is hard to ignore . 
Yet it is the third section of the event that may be the most important . 
It is a candlelight vigil , where participants remember the victims of sexual assault , and victims in the crowd can share their stories with the audience . 
It is , at the same time , both devastating and uplifting . 
Because we often seem to think that activism is about who can scream the loudest or disrupt <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> life the most , this kind of quiet protest is unusual . 
But it is crucial . 
As vital as it is that we speak out loudly about sexual assault , and demand that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> do everything it can to prevent it , there is another important part of combating sexual assault . 
The part that the vigil reaches out to -- supporting the victims . 
For victims of sexual assault , the terror does n't end when the assault does . 
Victims often suffer severe emotional consequences , most commonly some form of post-traumatic stress disorder . 
Symptoms often include flashbacks , nightmares , insomnia , severe depression and mood swings . 
Victims can experience denial , fear , increased anger and anxiety and a loss of trust . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> gained a valuable resource this year in the battle against sexual assault with the creation of One in Four , an all-male sexual assault education organization . 
The aim of One in Four is to educate men about sexual assault -- most specifically about how to help their female friends and family members cope . 
Because of this , they are not a highly visable organization -- they concern themselves with the behind-the-scenes , the aftermath of sexual assault more than its prevention . 
But they are by no means less important . 
While it is important that any movement against sexual assault concern itself with raising awareness and making the community safe , it must not forget the victims . 
The key to combating sexual assault is to form a balance between the loud moments and the quiet ones . 
Victory does n't only come in the form of a decrease in assault statistics . 
Every woman who finds the strength to stand up against her accuser in court , every woman who ends her silence by telling her story to someone , every woman who feels her pain lessen just a little because of our support is a victory of its own . 
We at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> are fortunate that so many of our sexual assault organizations understand this , and strive to give the victims of sexual assault the support and courage necessary to heal . 
And there is something else , equally important , that Take Back the <ORGANIZATION>Night</ORGANIZATION> gives victims : hope . 
Hope that so many outraged voices may prevent a rapist from striking again . 
Hope that with the support of the community , they may someday live their lives again without fear . 
<PERSON>Adrienne Ortolano</PERSON> found that hope , somehow . 
And took back her life .
