Despite the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> 's increased focus on preventing binge drinking in recent years , there still is a need for more programs specifically targeting female students , Women 's Center Director <PERSON>Sharon Davie</PERSON> said . 
Binge drinking is defined as consuming four or more alcoholic beverages in a row for women , or five or more drinks in a row for men . 
Even though women are more vulnerable to the dangers associated with binge drinking , most alcohol abuse prevention is focused on men , <PERSON>Davie</PERSON> said . 
" My perception is that the stereotype is that men drink a whole bunch more than women , and ... in the overall scheme of things , it seems men would be targeted more " in prevention programs , she said . 
But roughly equal numbers of female and male students are treated for alcohol-related ailments at the <ORGANIZATION>Student Health Center , Director of Student Health James Turner</ORGANIZATION> said . 
Because women react differently to alcohol than men , some alcohol education programs should be directed at women , <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said . 
" Women are less tolerant of alcohol , so they tend to get sicker sooner , so education effectively should be targeted specifically towards women , " <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> said . 
Despite women 's unique needs , <PERSON>Davie</PERSON> said she did not know of any binge drinking prevention programs at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> designed especially for females . 
But education is not necessarily the best way to prevent alcohol abuse by either gender , said <PERSON>Madeleine Chandler</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Outpatient Psychiatry Services</ORGANIZATION> employee and registered nurse . 
" Education does n't often " prevent binge drinking , <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON> said . 
Students " do get education on the dangers of binge drinking , but it does n't seem to help . " 
Alcohol abuse poses more severe safety threats to women than men , <PERSON>Davie</PERSON> said . 
" There is a level of vulnerability and risk of sexual assault for women that is at a higher extreme " when women are drinking , she said . 
Women also are more likely to experience feelings of guilt and shame about drinking problems , making them more susceptible to emotional and mental consequences associated with binge drinking , <PERSON>Chandler</PERSON> said . 
The Women 's Center has offered binge-drinking prevention programming in the past , but programs vary each semester . 
The Women 's Center does offer one-on-one counseling services to any student struggling with alcohol-related problems .
