<DATE>Monday</DATE> marked the beginning of a two-day national conference concerning sexual misconduct on college campuses hosted by <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
As President <PERSON>Barack Obama</PERSON> announced the formation of a task force in <DATE>January</DATE> to address the recent increase in sexual assaults on campuses , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> was in the final stages of planning the conference , " Dialogue at U.Va. : <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Among College Students</ORGANIZATION> , " through the efforts of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Patricia Lampkin</PERSON> , vice president and chief student affairs officer . 
Obama 's task force found one in five college students is likely to be sexually assaulted during his or her time at school , leading some to describe the situation as an epidemic . 
" The intention of this two-day dialogue is to launch a national discussion among higher education communities on the complexities surrounding sexual misconduct among college students , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> in a message on the conference 's website . 
" Our hope is to look at issues through a multifaceted lens , including individual , cultural , social and legal perspectives . " 
The conference brought together a wide range of sexual misconduct experts who specialize in issues ranging from education , prevention , adjudication and treatment of victims . 
Members of the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> , prosecutors and leaders from universities across the country also participated . 
Overall , 23 states and the <LOCATION>District of Columbia</LOCATION> were represented , along with representatives from 78 different institutions of higher education . 
In her opening remarks , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> began by pointing out that sexual misconduct undermines some of the highest principles espoused by higher learning . 
" We 're here because we agree we 're facing a major problem , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" We need to talk about this issue on many levels , including the level of institutional accountability . 
We want to make changes to a culture that fuels sexual misconduct . 
First , we need to start the conversation , then turn the conversation into action , then work to make sure the actions change the culture . " 
Following <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> , keynote speaker <PERSON>Linda Fairstein</PERSON> addressed the audience about legal responses to sexual misconduct . 
Fairstein is a lawyer , best-selling crime novelist and former prosecutor , and is regarded as one of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's leading experts on crimes of violence against women and children . 
Fairstein focused on the need to adjudicate sexual assault crimes in the criminal justice system , rather than through university-based systems , and on the criminal justice community 's own shortcomings in addressing cases of sexual assault . " 
[ The ] number of occurrences [ of sexual assault ] - that is simply unacceptable in any society that calls itself civilized , " <PERSON>Fairstein</PERSON> said . 
" So many young women remain reluctant on campuses to report the crimes [ because ] the historical response to these crimes has traditionally been so bad in the criminal justice system . " 
Following the keynote address , conference participants were given the choice to attend one of four breakout sessions , ranging from " Causes and Effects of Alcohol on Sexual Misconduct " to " Being a Better Bystander and Understanding Stalking . " 
Afterward , <PERSON>Catherine Lhamon</PERSON> , assistant secretary for civil rights at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> , spoke during lunch . 
Six university presidents then gathered to answer questions in a forum moderated by <PERSON>Hunter Rawlings III</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>American Association of Universities</ORGANIZATION> . 
Participating presidents included <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Gene Block of the University of California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Royce Engstrom</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Montana</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Carol Folt</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>the University of North Carolina</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Chapel Hill</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Philip Hanlon</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Dartmouth College</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Carolyn</PERSON> " Biddy " <ORGANIZATION>Martin of Amherst College</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> 's stated goal for the panel was to spur candid conversation about sexual misconduct on campuses , even though the topic is typically nuanced and emotionally charged . 
Students and audience members also offered panelists their input during the session 's question and answer portion . 
" What is needed is what , at universities , we do best - ... multidisciplinary approaches , " <PERSON>Folt</PERSON> said in her opening remarks . 
" It requires research - that 's what we do ; that 's in our DNA . 
It requires an engaged community . " 
Rawlings asked panelists to address the concept of effective consent and the challenges universities have in defining the term . 
Each panelist touched on the difficulties therein , but recognized it is the university president 's job to set expectations . 
<PERSON>Rawlings</PERSON> also asked the panel to address the common claim that university leaders sweep matters of sexual misconduct out of the spotlight . 
" The action of the president is crucial to get out in front of this [ claim ] immediately and proactively - tell the world as much as you can within the constraints of the legal system , " <PERSON>Engstrom</PERSON> said . 
Martin also brought up the phrase " insularity of the community " in regards to disclosures of sexual misconduct cases . 
In an insular community , she said , individuals ' loyalties can lead to barriers of openness , making it hard - but still necessary - to hold people accountable . 
The panel was then asked to discuss issues of confidentiality when dealing with cases of sexual misconduct . 
Hanlon pointed out the tension between maintaining the expected amount of confidentiality and effectively addressing community concerns after an assault occurs . 
The panel concluded by addressing the suggested correlation between cases of sexual misconduct and drinking , drug use and hookup culture . 
" Attributing causality is really difficult , " <PERSON>Hanlon</PERSON> said . 
" But excessive drinking , drug use and violence are all student safety issues , and we need to address all of them . " 
Martin pushed back against this suggestion . 
" What makes me uncomfortable is the implication that the way students socialize now must be cause of problem , which ca n't be true because problems existed when we were in college , even though we supposedly did n't have hookup culture , " he said . 
Following a second breakout session , the first day of the conference concluded with a reception and dinner followed by a screening of " Spitting Game : The College Hookup Culture " and an accompanying panel discussion featuring <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student leaders .
