You know someone who has been raped . 
Statistically , it 's true : one in four college women have been subject to completed or attempted rape . 
The actual number of sexual assaults is orders of magnitude higher than the reported number -- you know a survivor . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> must act swiftly and purposefully to confront this monster . 
Just as the administration brought about a President 's <ORGANIZATION>Commission on Diversity and Equity</ORGANIZATION> , they must now initiate a <ORGANIZATION>President 's Commission on Sexual Assault</ORGANIZATION> and Domestic Violence . 
Beginning with last semester 's discussions over the procedures of the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> ( SAB ) , the issue has slowly but steadily wormed its way above the surface . 
Recently , a debate over the appropriateness of the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> 's confidentiality rules and a damning article in The Hook entitled " How UVA Turns Its Back on Rape " has given inertia to movements for change . 
A protest was held this morning to further obliterate the culture of silence . 
The time to act is now . 
Circumstances today are akin to one year ago when the administration began the successful President 's <ORGANIZATION>Commission on Diversity and Equity</ORGANIZATION> . 
A widespread , harrowing problem has been punctuated by several high-profile events . 
Grumbling abounds in a student body dissatisfied with the steps the administration is taking . 
Everyone has some solution , but no one has the solution . 
What better way to tackle the issue than bringing together intelligent , invested individuals to create tangible options ? 
It was apparent listening to the planning meeting for today 's protest that ideas exist which are not being implemented . 
Thoughts included appointing one administrator to handle all things sexual assault-related , establishing a single-sanction for rape conviction , dismantling the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> ( with its zero expulsions over five years ) and boosting publicity for third-party reporting . 
<PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual assault education officer , said in an e-mail interview that she would like to see increased funding for her office and unified coordination through it of the various peer education groups . 
Surprisingly , few student leaders blame the administration . 
<PERSON>Rachel Vogus</PERSON> , co-chair of <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> 's safety and wellness committee and the vice president of NOW , expressed that the administration mostly needed education . 
" They are aware of the issues , but left in the same blaming-the-victims culture , " <PERSON>Vogus</PERSON> said . 
" Their awareness needs to be heightened . " 
NOW President <PERSON>Lauren Russo</PERSON> agreed . 
" Everybody has different ideas [ of how to handle sexual assault ] -- the administration is n't really horrible , and it is n't really great . " 
Indeed , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has taken many laudable actions over the years , including the establishment of the sexual assault education office , the recent consent campaign and continued effort to improve lighting around Grounds . 
Still , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> acknowledged that " sexual assault and domestic/dating violence are less ' present ' in the administration 's list of priorities -- particularly financial ones -- in that other issues are more pressing right now . " 
Others in the administration disagreed . 
In an interview , <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Students Penny Rue</ORGANIZATION> and Senior Associate Dean of Students <PERSON>Shamim Sisson</PERSON> , who oversees the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> proceedings , maintained that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is doing as much as any institution when it comes to sexual assault . 
However , they acknowledged that there was always more to accomplish ; <PERSON>Sisson</PERSON> likened it to Sisyphus pushing the boulder up his hill . 
A commission would provide a forum for these varying points of view to be heard and synthesized toward a common goal , a la the <ORGANIZATION>Commission on Diversity and Equity</ORGANIZATION> . 
Both <ORGANIZATION>Rue</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Sisson</PERSON> said that they were open to the idea of a presidential commission , while <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> , Vogus and <PERSON>Russo</PERSON> expressed enthusiasm for the idea . 
University President <PERSON>John T. Casteen III</PERSON> said in an e-mail that the administration was looking at several options for addressing sexual assault , but " it is too soon for anyone to say just how we will proceed on this issue . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has a chance to become a leader in the fight against sexual assault . 
By establishing a <ORGANIZATION>Commission on Sexual Assault</ORGANIZATION> and Domestic Violence , the administration will take a bold first step in acknowledging the depth of the problem and working toward real solutions . 
By lending sustainability and authority to the sentiment expressed in today 's protest , the administration will be honoring the courage displayed by survivors who have spoken up about the need for change . 
There are no easy answers to sexual assault . 
As with race relations , there is no panacea , no silver bullet , which will make one in four disappear . 
Yet there is every opportunity to improve the climate , improve the response and improve the sanction . 
No one has the solution , which is precisely why a group of students , faculty and experts should be assembled to come up with a multitude of proposals . 
Sexual assault is an issue which bridges every divide . 
It touches women and men , students and staff , conservatives , liberals and everyone in between . 
Silence is no longer an option . 
Silence can no longer be allowed to remain an option . 
As students , as community members and as human beings , we must come together and shout down the demons of ignorance . 
Remember -- you know someone who has been raped .
