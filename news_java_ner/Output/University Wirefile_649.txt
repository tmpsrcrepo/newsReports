<PERSON>John Pappas</PERSON> | The Cavalier Daily First-year College student Â   Jenneca Graber-Grace Â   said Â   <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> 's <PERCENT>27.5 percent</PERCENT> poverty rate needs to be addressed by the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , the largest employer in the area . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University 's Living Wage Campaign</ORGANIZATION> held a rally <DATE>Thursday</DATE> demanding all <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> workers receive a living wage . 
The ralliers marched to <PERSON>Madison Hall</PERSON> to deliver a petition signed by more than 1,200 individuals . 
The petition calls for administration to schedule a meeting between <ORGANIZATION>Students United</ORGANIZATION> for a Living Wage members , legal officials and <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administration senior members responsible for overseeing budgets and finances . 
The petition calls for an increase in oversight of contracted corporations by officially auditing <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> contractors and also calls for a living wage for all <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> workers . 
First-year College student <ORGANIZATION>Jenneca Graber-Grace</ORGANIZATION> initiated the rally and said workers at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> are not receiving enough pay to sustain a good life . 
" The work performed by these hard working people is critical to the way our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> runs , yet members of our administration turn a blind eye to their treatment and compensation , " <PERSON>Graber-Grace</PERSON> said . 
" Currently the poverty rate in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> is a staggering <PERCENT>27.5 percent</PERCENT> . 
As the largest employer in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , holds exceptional power over the city 's economic health . " 
Fourth-year College student <PERSON>Caitlin Levine</PERSON> spoke about the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's pursuit of profit at the expense of its workers . 
" I feel infuriated because our public <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> cares more about making money than it does about your favorite dining hall worker , about the mother who cleans your dorm bathroom , about the father who gets to the <ORGANIZATION>Chemistry</ORGANIZATION> building at six in the morning to make sure that your classrooms are in tip-top shape , " <PERSON>Levine</PERSON> said . 
" They care more about profit than those human beings . " 
University spokesperson <PERSON>Matthew Charles</PERSON> said , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has established its own " minimum hiring rate , " which has increased by <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT> annually for the past several years . 
" With the increase scheduled for later this year , the minimum hiring rate will have increased by <PERCENT>18.5 percent</PERCENT> since the Presidential commitment was made , or <PERCENT>3.7 percent</PERCENT> per year over the past five years , " <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> said in an email . 
" This compares to the one state-granted increase for Classified Staff during this same timeframe of <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT> plus longevity bonuses effective <DATE>November 2013</DATE> . " 
English Prof. <PERSON>Susan Fraiman</PERSON> helped launch the Living Wage campaign when it began in <DATE>1998</DATE> . 
She said the campaign serves to work alongside other activist groups , instead of attempting to address all issues independently . 
" In light of recent events , it might seem that ' wagers ' should step back and allow the spotlight to remain on the important issue of sexual assault , " <PERSON>Fraiman</PERSON> said . 
" In fact , the opposite is true . 
The Living Wage campaign is an invaluable resource , an indispensable coalition partner for any group concerned with social justice issues on this campus . " 
Fraiman also said activist groups must work together in order to " sustain a culture of activism at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> , " by providing support and serving as coalition partners . 
" Now is the time for everyone concerned with changing the climate for women and for workers , now is the time for all of us to get involved , " <PERSON>Fraiman</PERSON> said . 
" The categories of women and workers are not mutually exclusive . 
Low-waged staff are disproportionately female . " 
Arts and Sciences graduate student <PERSON>Laura Goldblatt</PERSON> said the campaign wants to make sure students are aware of what is happening on Grounds , and to raise workers ' wages . 
" We want to let the administration and the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> know that there are a lot of people on campus , in the surrounding community and among the alumni who support the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> doing what 's right , and paying its workers a living wage , " <PERSON>Goldblatt</PERSON> said .
