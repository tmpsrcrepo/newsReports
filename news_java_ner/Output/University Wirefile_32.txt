The <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Education Council</ORGANIZATION> discussed implementing its new policies -- including publicizing sexual assault cases at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> -- at its meeting <TIME>last night</TIME> . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> is more focused now , and can specialize in matters of sexual assault , " said Assoc. Dean of Students <PERSON>V. Shamim Sisson</PERSON> , who is also the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> chairwoman . 
" One of the major differences of the new policies is that in previous years the process followed the [ <ORGANIZATION>University Judiciary Council</ORGANIZATION> ] format of trials . " 
There are two separate boards at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> that deal with sexual assault -- the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Judicial Review Board</ORGANIZATION> , which deals with appeals . 
In <DATE>April</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> voted and President <PERSON>John T. Casteen III</PERSON> approved altering the method in which sexual assault cases would be tried beginning this academic year . 
Under the new policies , the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> will only hear cases dealing with sexual assault . 
" Now the advisors who are assigned to students will be emotional and personal supports , " <PERSON>Sisson</PERSON> said . 
Previously , the former <ORGANIZATION>University Committee on Sexual Assault and Judicial Review</ORGANIZATION> handled matters relating to sexual assault and appeal cases . 
Now the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> will serve as a panel while hearing cases , and will ask questions to both parties and their witnesses , <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Education</ORGANIZATION> Coordinator <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
" Overall , the new policies have made the procedure of handling such cases less legalistic , " <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said . 
She said the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> will not handle sexual assault cases and the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> will take over all cases previously heard by <ORGANIZATION>UCSAJR</ORGANIZATION> . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> is not hearing the cases , so the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Board</ORGANIZATION> will deal with their cases in a different manner , " she added . 
The <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> is made up of faculty , students and <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> staff . 
At least one student , two faculty members and a chairman must serve on a panel . 
<PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> said in the event of a guilty verdict , the victim will have the opportunity to file a " victim impact statement , " which the <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> will consider while deciding the sanction for the convicted . 
A " victim impact report , " written by the victim of the sexual assault , describes the impact the assault had on theirs lives . 
The <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> is not bound to impose a sanction , but may take the report into consideration while making their decision . 
In addition , she said others besides victims will have new avenues to report incidents of sexual assault . 
" Now University students are able to file third party sexual assault reports on the Web , " she added . 
According to official 1998-99 <ORGANIZATION>SAB</ORGANIZATION> procedures , a case must be filed as a written complaint to Dean of Students <PERSON>Robert T. Canevari</PERSON> , after which the <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Student 's Office</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> can start a formal investigation . 
The <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> then investigates to determine the extent the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> has jurisdiction over the case . 
If the <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Student 's Office</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>UJC</ORGANIZATION> find the assault is within the jurisdiction of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , advisors are assigned to both the accuser and the accused . 
Sanctions for sexual assault range from verbal admonition to expulsion . 
Women 's Center Director <PERSON>Sharon Davie</PERSON> could not be reached for comment . 
Asst. Dean of Students <PERSON>John Foubert</PERSON> also discussed his new male peer education program on sexual assault at the meeting . 
" It treats men as potential helpers , not potential rapists , " <PERSON>Foubert</PERSON> said . 
" Only men can prevent rape -- women can reduce their risks of being raped . "
