Fellow Wahoos , My name is <LOCATION>Emily</LOCATION> , and I was <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's suitemate first year . 
I am writing to you in regards to Rolling Stone 's recent statement of " misplaced trust " in <LOCATION>Jackie</LOCATION> . 
I feel this statement is backwards , as it seems it was <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> who misplaced her trust in Rolling Stone . 
I fully support <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> , and I believe wholeheartedly that she went through a traumatizing sexual assault . 
I remember my first semester here , and I remember <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> 's . 
Jackie came to <ORGANIZATION>UVA</ORGANIZATION> bright , happy and bubbly . 
She was kind , funny , outgoing , friendly , and a pleasant person to be around . 
That all notably changed by <DATE>December 2012</DATE> , and I was n't the only one who noticed . 
Our suite bonded that first semester and talked many times about the new troubles we were facing in college . 
Jackie never mentioned anything about her assault to us until much later . 
But I , as well as others , noticed <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> becoming more and more withdrawn and depressed . 
I remember her alarm going off every morning . 
I always assumed she had gone to class and forgot to turn off her later alarms . 
Being the lazy freshman I was , I tended to roll over in bed and pay no mind to it , hoping somebody else would turn it off , and remind <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> about it once she got back from class . 
If I had known <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> was n't going to class , that she was curled up in bed without the will to turn off the alarm , things would have been much different . 
I remember second semester , she shared a <ORGANIZATION>Netflix</ORGANIZATION> account with me and I noticed how much TV she was watching - hours and hours of shows that seemed to get darker and darker as time went on . 
I wondered how she had time , with homework and school , and I wondered if she was okay . 
I did n't ask . 
I wish I had . 
In <DATE>December 2012</DATE> , <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> broke down . 
All of a sudden she was going home and none of us knew why . 
It was right before finals , and I could n't believe she was leaving . 
She was distraught , and only said she needed to go home . 
Her teachers had given her allowance to take her finals over break . 
At that point , we knew something big had happened . 
I did n't know until this year with the publication of Rolling Stone 's article how bad that time was for her . 
Sometime that year I remember her letting it slip to me that she had had a terrible experience at a party . 
I remember her telling me that multiple men had assaulted her at this party . 
She did n't say anything more . 
It seemed that was all she 'd allow herself to say . 
I wish I had done something sooner . 
I wish I had known how to help . 
But I applaud <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> for telling her story , now <DATE>two years later</DATE> . 
It was a story that needed to be told . 
However , the articles released in the past few days have been troubling to me , and the responses to them even more so . 
While I can not say what happened that night , and I can not prove the validity of every tiny aspect of her story to you , I can tell you that this story is not a hoax , a lie or a scheme . 
Something terrible happened to <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> at the hands of several men who have yet to receive any repercussions . 
Whether the details are correct or not , and whether the reporting was faulty , or the hazy memories of a traumatizing night got skewed ... the blame should never fall on the victim 's shoulders . 
Jackie is a victim , as are so many others , men and women , young and old . 
So many stories have gone untold and so many perpetrators have been allowed to walk free . 
There is fear among us , and there is pain after these past few weeks of turmoil . 
But there is also hope , which has been manifested in a multitude of protests , speeches , and groups formed . 
There is a support growing among students and faculty that has never been seen before . 
The number of conversations occurring about rape , rights , consent and justice is astounding and inspiring , but talking only goes so far . 
As we approach this much-needed winter break I urge you to continue to support your fellow wahoos ; do not let this issue die . 
Speak up when you see something happening that does not feel right ; act when you have a chance to stop something terrible . 
Talk with your friends , let them know you support them , and that no reputation matters more than their own safety and basic human rights . 
Let them know you 'll stand by them and that their stories do matter . 
Walk your friends home , look out for one another , do not turn your back on a fellow student . 
Discourage those who have caved to peer pressure which encourages them to devalue another human being . 
Support the efforts of the groups leading change in the wake of this tough semester : One Less , Not on Our Grounds ( #HoosGotYourBack ) , Help Save the Next Girl , and Buddies on Call . 
Let the nation know we are not a scandal school , but a school that does not tolerate injustice . 
We are in the public eye right now , and we can either let that cripple us , and shove us back into the mold of a perfect institution , or we can recognize that we have flaws , but that we work to reconcile them . 
Sexual assault is not just a <ORGANIZATION>UVA</ORGANIZATION> issue , but <ORGANIZATION>UVA</ORGANIZATION> is where this issue has come to the forefront . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> is a school historically known for its powerful student body . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Hoos of UVA</ORGANIZATION> have always rallied when a change was needed . 
We still stand as one of the top schools in the nation , and we can be the face of change . 
Let us be an example , and not a failure . 
Let us stand with survivors .
