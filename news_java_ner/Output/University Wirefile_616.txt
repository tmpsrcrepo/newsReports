Xiaoqi Li | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> addressed the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community <DATE>Friday</DATE> with an update on recent and upcoming initiatives , and discussed the ongoing <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> self-examination brought on by the critiques of last semester . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> also responded to questions concerning the letter from the <ORGANIZATION>National Panhellenic Conference requesting University</ORGANIZATION> sorority chapters to refrain from participating in Boys Bid Night . 
" I have not spoken with national sorority leaders , nor did they consult us about the letter that they sent , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" I would encourage you to talk to our own sorority leaders because I am not certain this came without consultation . " 
In response to a question on how she would respond were a sorority member at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said that while she can not advise specific student reactions , sorority members themselves likely have the best idea of how to appropriately respond . 
" It was the choice of those of you in sororities to join the organization , and you must decide the extent of which you wish to abide by the policies of the organization , " she said . 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said that while discussion of the sanctions is important , students must be responsible for making the best decision according to their consciences . 
" I do always think that dialogue is helpful in these situations , because there are misunderstandings , especially [ in ] only communicating with each other in paper and press releases , " she said . 
" Ultimately I trust the maturity of our students to make these good decisions . " 
Overall , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> sought to focus discussion around larger University initiatives , such as the Ad <ORGANIZATION>Hoc Group on Climate and Culture</ORGANIZATION> . 
" At the beginning of this new year at <LOCATION>U.Va.</LOCATION> , we are deeply engaged in a period of institutional self-examination , with the goal of assessing and improving the climate and culture at our <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" To lead this work , I assembled an Ad <ORGANIZATION>Hoc Group on Climate</ORGANIZATION> and Culture that includes administrators , faculty , staff , students , parents , alumni and members of the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> . " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said the Ad <ORGANIZATION>Hoc Group</ORGANIZATION> considered both the cultural roots of harmful student behavior and how to implement effective practices to limit such behavior as a University community . 
" We divided the issues into three categories - prevention , response and culture - and we now have a working group of students , faculty , staff , parents , and alumni assigned to each category , " she said . 
" These groups will be working carefully , but briskly , [ and ] will deliver interim reports by <DATE>March 16</DATE> and final reports by <DATE>April 30</DATE> . " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> announced the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's participation in a sexual assault climate survey organized through the <ORGANIZATION>Association of American Universities</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>April</DATE> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is one of 28 schools participating in the survey . 
" The questionnaire is being designed by a team of researchers with experience in sexual violence , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" The participating schools enroll more than 800,000 students , making the survey one of the largest ever on sexual assault . " 
The team of researchers conducting the survey is headed by <ORGANIZATION>University of North Carolina</ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON>Sandra Martin</PERSON> . 
Data from the survey will be available by <DATE>July</DATE> , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said , allowing the results to inform education and prevention strategies for the next academic year . 
" People know that most forms of sexual violence are seriously underreported , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said , " One of the things a climate survey does , that 's one with a large enough response rate , is it lets you estimate the incidents of sexual violence in a different way from reported cases . " 
<PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> also outlined some of the initiatives and programs emerging from the Cornerstone Plan - a strategic plan submitted in <DATE>2013</DATE> regarding the future of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Programs developed as a part of the Cornerstone Plan include student programs such as the <ORGANIZATION>Meriwether Lewis Institute for Citizen Leadership</ORGANIZATION> , the Total Advising Initiative and a variety of co-curricular and extracurricular international programs . 
" Another strategy in the Cornerstone Plan is to create a series of pan-University research institutes to allow faculty teams to collaborate on research while generating new degree programs , minors , and certificate programs for students , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
After a <MONEY>$ 3 billion</MONEY> campaign in <DATE>2013</DATE> , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is focusing on attracting private support for three key priorities : retaining and recruiting top faculty , providing outstanding students with need-based scholarships and restoring the Jeffersonian buildings around Grounds . 
" Just as we summoned all of our intellectual capability to study and plan for the complex work of the Rotunda restoration , we will now summon all of the intellectual resources of our great university to make this a stronger , safer university , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said .
