Americans have dirty minds . 
Why are we so curious about the details of a sexual affair or rape accusation ? 
Everyone seems to be intrigued by the most graphic details in the <PERSON>Kobe Bryant</PERSON> rape case . 
For instance , it is quite disturbing that <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> repeatedly reports that the girl had lacerations in the vaginal area and blood on her panties . 
I thought we hit the limit when it was reported that our former President Slick <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> decided to use a cigar as a sexual device on his intern Ms. <PERSON>Lewinsky</PERSON> . 
No one in their right mind enjoyed that mental image , so why do we keep asking for more ? 
The <PERSON>Bryant</PERSON> rape case is a serious accusation -- <PERSON>Kobe Bryant</PERSON> is not charged with rape against <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , so we do not need to be informed of the most intimate sexual details of this supposed encounter . 
Both the victim 's and <PERSON>Bryant</PERSON> 's reputations are marred by this whole experience , despite the outcome of the verdict . 
The details of this case should not be open to the public . 
A jury will fairly adjudicate the trial -- there is no need for the typical American to make this decision . 
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> has a rape shield law which keeps the victim 's name and privacy secure . 
The privacy of a rape victim should be protected , but the standard of " innocent until proven guilty " is violated . 
Even if <PERSON>Kobe</PERSON> is acquitted , his reputation is forever marred . 
Everyone will always hold their own mental image of what allegedly happened behind closed doors . 
Although <PERSON>Kobe</PERSON> deserves disdain from the American public if he is guilty , the details of this case unfairly implicate <PERSON>Kobe</PERSON> in an accused violent rape . 
If <PERSON>Kobe</PERSON> has some mental strength , his basketball game should not suffer from this trial ; but for endorsements and advertisements , his career is damaged . 
Adidas is not going to want an accused rapist as their spokesperson -- <PERSON>Kobe makes R. Kelly</PERSON> look like a saint in light of the recent trial and subsequent graphic evidence . 
Besides <PERSON>Kobe</PERSON> 's already stained image , " sexually penetrated her , hurting her to the point that she bled " and " injuries to the woman 's vaginal area " should not be socially accepted language in the media . 
In no way is the media at fault -- Americans ' curiosity fuels the media 's sensationalism of people 's sexual lives . 
Somehow we moved from incessant grilling of the public lives of the rich and famous to the now all-inclusive bedroom behavior of celebrities . 
Regulations in the media industry are ineffective , despite Republican and the pseudo-Democrat <PERSON>Joseph Lieberman</PERSON> 's attempts to restrict violence and sex on television . 
The American interest is the cause , and the only solution to this problem is for everyone to stop caring . 
Kids watching CNN or reading The Washington Post should not be subjected to reports of a teenager 's panties . 
Our curiosity is leading to a youth population knowledgeable on matters of the former president 's sexual relations and now , the graphic details of a rape accusation . 
I am not supporting any type of restrictions on the First Amendment 's freedom of speech , but I am appalled at the recent coverage of the Kobe case . 
There are decency standards , and thus far , reporting on the case has been in bad taste . 
Self-restraint is a necessity in order to encourage the media to refrain from such graphic details . 
Perusing The Washington Post should not be a trip through <ORGANIZATION>Playboy</ORGANIZATION> 's erotic story section . 
We are only in the preliminary hearing stages -- I can only imagine how graphic the case will become when the likely trial will grow to O.J. status . 
For all you inquiring Americans , soon you will probably hear the sexual histories of both <PERSON>Kobe</PERSON> and the alleged victim , more discussion on these mysterious panties and <PERSON>Kobe</PERSON> 's anatomy and lots of gossip from the students of <ORGANIZATION>Eagle Creek</ORGANIZATION> . 
Using the publicity of this case , the media could instead inform the public of the legal system or rape awareness . 
I have a difficult time understanding why so many people continue to question the sex lives of those in the spotlight . 
Censorship is not the answer to stopping the media 's intense coverage of celebrities . 
Instead , the population needs to express its repulsion at the excessive nature of the media to report sexual details . 
Both the girl and <PERSON>Kobe</PERSON> can not enjoy hearing accounts of <TIME>that night</TIME> , so instead of ruining their reputations , we should let the jury decide who is to blame . 
Defy the American trend , and stop caring about whose blood is in someone 's panties .
