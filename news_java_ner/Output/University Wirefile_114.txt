Concerns about legality and morality took center stage <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> , as <PERSON>Fiona Givins</PERSON> , vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Society for Human Life</ORGANIZATION> , and <PERSON>Stephanie Mueller</PERSON> , communications director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Abortion Federation</ORGANIZATION> , wrangled over the emotionally charged issue of abortion . 
<PERSON>Givins</PERSON> , a pro-lifer , presented her argument first and called abortion the " most compelling , controversial , divisive issue of our time . " 
Current <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> laws delineate few restrictions for women seeking an abortion , she said . 
Givins called abortion the destruction of a living human being and said the procedure violates the rights of an unborn child . 
Unborn children are a separate entity from the women bearing them , and they deserve the same rights as any other person , <PERSON>Givins</PERSON> said . 
" It is the government 's duty to protect those who can not protect themselves , " she said . 
" How could this procedure be possible in this country -- the ' land of the free and the home of the brave ' ? " 
Givins also compared abortion to the enslavement of blacks in pre-Civil War <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
" In one instance you are discriminating against someone because of the color of their skin , and in the other instance you are discriminating against someone because of their size or place of residence , " she said . 
She graphically described the procedure of partial-birth abortions , which she claimed is never fully explained . 
Abortion can have serious physical and mental repercussions for the woman having the abortion , she added . 
All abortions are dangerous and can result in sterility , future miscarriages or post-traumatic stress disorder , <PERSON>Givins</PERSON> said . 
She said while women who suffer miscarriages grieve immediately , women who have abortions often suppress feelings of guilt , causing possible future psychological problems . 
" Abortion leaves in its wake broken bodies , shattered lives and grieving mothers , " she added . 
Mueller disputed <ORGANIZATION>Givin</ORGANIZATION> 's claim that abortion is a dangerous procedure and stressed the need to keep the procedure legal in order to maintain safety . 
Abortion is one of the safest surgical procedures available and is 10 times safer than childbirth itself , she said . 
" If you make abortion illegal , it will not stop abortion -- it will stop safe abortion , " <PERSON>Mueller</PERSON> said . 
Those who want abortion to remain legal do not necessarily favor abortion over other options , she said . 
" We only endorse abortion as an option . 
I would never tell a woman to have an abortion , " she added . 
<PERSON>Mueller</PERSON> said abortion counselors provide women with information about abortion but do not encourage women to have abortions . 
Abortion counselors have turned more women away from abortion clinics than the efforts of anti-abortion protestors have , she claimed . 
<PERSON>Mueller</PERSON> said pro-choice groups believe abortion is a private healthcare decision that the woman , not the government , should make . 
Because there is no consensus as to when human life actually begins , <PERSON>Mueller</PERSON> said she believes abortion is a religious and philosophical question that should not be in the hands of the government . 
Eighty-six percent of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> counties have no abortion provider because abortion clinics face harassment from protesters , she said . 
<PERSON>Mueller</PERSON> said pro-choice organizations are dedicated to " protecting women 's health and saving women 's lives . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Jefferson Society</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Daniel Grunberger</PERSON> said the debate provided students with the opportunity to participate by asking questions . 
Second-year College student <PERSON>Levi Fox</PERSON> said he enjoyed hearing both sides of the debate . 
" Both sides made good representations of their cases and I thought both speakers were very professional , " <ORGANIZATION>Fox</ORGANIZATION> said .
