<ORGANIZATION>Iowa State</ORGANIZATION> will put names and faces to stories of sexual assault <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> . 
Victims and survivors of rape will step forward to share their experiences with violence during the " Take Back the Night " rally and march tonight . 
<PERSON>Laura Armstrong</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Women 's Center Sexual Assault Services</ORGANIZATION> coordinator , said " Take Back the Night " is an important issue that is often times swept under the carpet because it is so hard to talk about . 
" In a community like Ames , it is easy to believe that sexual assault does n't occur , " said <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Committee Against Violence</ORGANIZATION> co-chair . 
" We tend to not think about it , but we really need to raise awareness on rape . 
Seventy to <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> are acquaintance or date rapes , while 20 to <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> are strangers . 
These issues need to be recognized . " 
The rally will begin at the steps of <ORGANIZATION>Curtiss Hall</ORGANIZATION> at <TIME>7:15 tonight</TIME> followed by a march through <PERSON>Campustown</PERSON> and the greek community . 
Luminaries will guide the marchers as they chant verses supporting the safety of women . 
The march will end back on central campus for a reception at the <ORGANIZATION>Margaret Sloss House Women 's Center</ORGANIZATION> . 
The rally will feature four speakers : <PERSON>Julie Wooden</PERSON> from ACCESS ( <ORGANIZATION>Assault Care Center Extending Shelter</ORGANIZATION> and Support ) , who will be presenting introductions ; <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> , who will talk about date rape ; <PERSON>Nancy Ziegenmeyer</PERSON> , the rally 's featured speaker , who will discuss her experience with rape and her book " Taking Back My Life " ; and <PERSON>Sara Junck</PERSON> , volunteer and worker at ACCESS , who will talk about what it is like to be a part of a community against violence . 
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said organizers have worked to have many groups involved in the rally . 
" We 've done a lot of advertising , from the greek communities to the residence halls , " <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" Also a lot of ' Take Back the <TIME>Night</TIME> ' rallies forbid men from participating , whereas at <ORGANIZATION>ISU</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Committee Against Violence</ORGANIZATION> encourages men to come because it is not just a women 's issue . 
The rally is a joint effort with all genders . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said one of the goals of the rally is to put a face with the statistics . 
" We tend to read about rape , and it 's always someone else , " <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" With this rally , we 're bringing faces to the stories , which really can be quite powerful and emotional . 
This is a way we can stand together and refuse to accept violence towards women . " 
<PERSON>Judy Dolphin</PERSON> , director of the Ames-ISU <ORGANIZATION>YWCA</ORGANIZATION> , said this is an event in which students take the initiative . 
" It shows solidarity and support for the concept of being safe on the streets , " said <PERSON>Dolphin</PERSON> , adviser to the <ORGANIZATION>Committee on Violence</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Women should be able to take comfort in the fact that there is concern and we are doing something about it . " 
Dolphin said " Take Back the Night " is a global event that occurs in the <DATE>fall</DATE> , but due to a concern of safety during <LOCATION>Veishea</LOCATION> , students decided to recognize sexual assault awareness in the <DATE>spring</DATE> . 
" When you hear the stories of people who have been touched by violence , it makes people want to take part in these events , " <PERSON>Dolphin</PERSON> said . 
" The march is a visible demonstration to the community to stand up and take notice of what is going on around them . "
