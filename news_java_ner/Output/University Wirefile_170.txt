<PERSON>John Ashcroft</PERSON> is the worst Attorney General President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> could have selected . 
Well , maybe that 's an overstatement , but he certainly does not seem to possess any of the qualities and virtues necessary to be a good Attorney General of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> . 
His vigor in the battle against terror is honorable and worthy of respect , but his methods are frighteningly cold and detached from the ideas of federalism , religion , freedom and , ironically , justice . 
In the nearly two years the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration has been at the country 's helm , he has shown himself to be a rigid despot who does things his way , regardless of the law . 
Watch him in the post-Sept . 
11 news and he is presented as a stoic warrior fighting to protect innocent Americans from those who would attack them . 
But this is also the man who , if he had his way , would have made it legal for a man to rape his wife in <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> . 
Defending Civil War Confederacy dogma , accepting an honorary degree at <ORGANIZATION>Bob Jones University</ORGANIZATION> ( which at the time had banned interracial dating ) , inexplicably blocking the appointment of a black judge and supporting prosecution of women who get abortions for the charge of murder truly endeared him to the public . 
He did make advances in stopping racial profiling -- and that 's certainly one promise he made to minorities he has n't reneged on . 
The detention of alleged terrorists in the wake of <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> has turned from part of a wartime protection act into the biggest racial mistake this government has made since the internment of Asians during World War II . 
America has made a great deal of mistakes regarding minorities , but to indefinitely detain more than 1,000 " enemy combatants " and refuse to charge them with offenses , forbid them to see lawyers and hold them for being " dangerous " is something about which the nation should be outraged . 
But if you think about it , this police-state restriction of due process for perceived threats is a good move . 
<PERSON>Anna Nicole Smith</PERSON> is a danger to rich old white men , <PERSON>James Traficant</PERSON> is a danger to anyone who 's sane and <ORGANIZATION>Mark Warner</ORGANIZATION> puts a lot of jobs here at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> in jeopardy . 
So let 's get Ashcroft to bust these offenders ' butts down to Camp X-Ray for a great vacation in sunny <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> 's <LOCATION>Guantanamo Bay</LOCATION> , spent in luxurious containment in a small cell with no windows and food . 
And who can forget <PERSON>Aschroft</PERSON> 's stunt last fall when he threatened to withdraw critical prescription writing privileges from <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> doctors if they participated in legal physician-assisted suicides . 
While his religious posturing is offensive in itself , the real problem is that he would go to the point of improper obstruction in state business . 
Apparently , the section in the Constitution on separation of powers was not taught at <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> . 
Luckily , the courts struck down this intervention into state affairs . 
Last week , the <ORGANIZATION>United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON>Ashcroft</PERSON> 's guidelines for wiretaps and surveillance in the fight against terrorism as suggested in the <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION> Patriot Act . 
The bill was passed last fall -- and with a name like the <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION> Patriot Act , who could oppose it ? 
Under the new bill , investigators may invoke surveillance laws when watching suspected terrorists is a " significant purpose , " not the main purpose . 
Under such standards , anyone could be wiretapped and watched if they are " significantly " suspected . 
Apparently , warrantless wiretaps and Internet taps are part of <PERSON>Ashcroft</PERSON> 's attempts to reduce the size of the government . 
Now the guy seems to be doing the same things that made <PERSON>Janet Reno</PERSON> such a big target for Republicans . 
<PERSON>Richard Jewell</PERSON> , the innocent man accused of the bombing during the <LOCATION>Atlanta Olympics</LOCATION> , was savaged by the media for weeks . 
The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> let the media make a pinata of <PERSON>Jewell</PERSON> despite their having no evidence against him and <PERSON>Jewell</PERSON> 's life was changed forever despite his not having done wrong . 
There is a parallel situation occurring in <DATE>2002</DATE> . 
The failure to catch the " Anthrax Killer " has been an embarrassment for the government . 
Leaks of the investigation led the media to descend upon scientist <PERSON>Steven Hatfill</PERSON> 's apartment during two <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> searches . 
<PERSON>Hatfill</PERSON> claims that his girlfriend was mistreated and told that he had killed five people . 
Perhaps <PERSON>Hatfill</PERSON> did send the anthrax that killed those people ; however , <PERSON>Ashcroft</PERSON> says there are many suspects and , unless he is withholding information from the public , it is irresponsible to allow leaks and then stay quiet regarding one of the biggest media stories in the past year . 
Really , <PERSON>Ashcroft</PERSON> is <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> 's personal vacuum cleaner : He gets plugged in by the president and runs around relentlessly cleaning up the nation . 
He sees pro-choice activists , atheists and minorities and immediately sucks up their civil rights as if they were an unsightly stain on <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
All in all , perhaps the people from his home state of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> saw this coming and knew how to handle him . 
<LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> voters had a tough time picking candidates in the <DATE>November 2000</DATE> Senatorial race and , ultimately , <PERSON>Mel Carnahan</PERSON> edged out <PERSON>Ashcroft</PERSON> despite the fact that <PERSON>Carnahan</PERSON> had died the month before . 
I was never a huge fan during her tenure , but now I long for <ORGANIZATION>Reno</ORGANIZATION> .
