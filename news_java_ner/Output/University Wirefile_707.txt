The Cavalier Daily " The problems we outlined were problems of methodology , " <PERSON>Coronel</PERSON> said . 
" We do n't believe in this case , <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> was to blame . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is one of 27 universities participating in a climate survey on sexual assault and sexual misconduct organized by <ORGANIZATION>the Association of American Universities</ORGANIZATION> . 
Between all involved schools , over 800,000 students are invited to participate in the survey administered by independent research firm <ORGANIZATION>Westat</ORGANIZATION> . 
In <DATE>July 2014</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> and five other <ORGANIZATION>AAU</ORGANIZATION> universities decided to select an independent firm to develop a survey , which <ORGANIZATION>Westat</ORGANIZATION> began to develop in <DATE>Nov. 2014</DATE> . 
Students are invited to participate in the survey until it closes <DATE>April 29</DATE> . 
The survey includes questions about students ' knowledge and beliefs about social situations , perceptions about sexual misconduct , resources available at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and individual experiences with sexual assault and misconduct . 
All responses will be confidential , and the results will be presented in summary form so no individual can be identified . 
AAU President <PERSON>Hunter Rawlings</PERSON> said the survey 's goal is to develop programs and services that both minimize sexual assault and misconduct and respond better to incidents of sexual violence . 
" Our primary purpose in conducting this survey is to help our institutions gain a better understanding of this complex problem on their own campuses as well as nationally , " <PERSON>Rawlings</PERSON> said in a press release from <ORGANIZATION>AAU</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Our first priority , and theirs , is to ensure that students not only are safe but feel safe . " 
The survey is identical for all schools , except for five questions specific to each university . 
AAU will report the results from all participating universities and provide each university with its own data , which the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will receive on <DATE>Sept. 1 , 2015</DATE> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> also plans to release its own report mid-September . 
" We are pleased that we will be able to conduct a climate survey involving so many universities and students from every region of the country , " <PERSON>Rawlings</PERSON> said . 
" We have an excellent cross-section of our institutions - about half public and half private , rural and urban , with a range of sizes . " 
<PERSON>Christina Morell</PERSON> , associate vice president for student affairs , also noted the importance of diversity in the survey 's responses , both for the national survey and the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> specifically . 
" It 's not an issue of number but of ensuring we have good representation from all types of students on Grounds , " <PERSON>Morell</PERSON> said in an email . 
" We hope all students reply as student input is critical to getting a true picture of the campus climate on sexual assault , dating and domestic violence and sexual harassment . " 
All undergraduate , graduate and professional students above the age of 18 who are enrolled in a degree program are asked to complete the survey . 
<PERSON>Morell</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> hopes at least <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of students will respond . 
<PERSON>Morell</PERSON> said the data from the survey will identify specific areas to target and will help to inform prevention and education programs . 
" The data also will help identify opportunities to enhance our policy and related procedures on sexual and-gender based harassment and other forms of interpersonal violence and how through training and outreach we promote student understanding of what constitutes prohibited conduct , the institutional response in such cases and the resources available to students who experience sexual violence , " <PERSON>Morell</PERSON> said .
