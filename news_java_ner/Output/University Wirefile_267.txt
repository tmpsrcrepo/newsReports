MANY YOUNG journalists I know get into the business in part because they want to deliver truth to society . 
They believe that the newspapers they work for strive for objectivity and fairness in reporting . 
Yet no matter how hard they try to give an unfiltered version of events , there are certain subjects that , at all levels of the game , provoke accusations of bias . 
In my experience , the top three most controversial topics are <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> , elections and race . 
Last week The Cavalier Daily ran two articles on a story about a black man arrested and accused of sexually assaulting a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> graduate student ; the allegations later proved to be false . 
<DATE>Tuesday</DATE> 's article detailed the arrest ( " City man arrested for sexual assault , <DATE>Sept. 6</DATE> ) , and <DATE>Friday</DATE> 's was about the man 's release based on DNA tests that cleared him of wrongdoing ( " City man cleared in sexual assault investigation , " <DATE>Sept. 9</DATE> ) . 
Some readers were concerned about the coverage , especially the prominent placement of the man 's mug shot : front page , above the fold . 
One reader was concerned that the placement would perpetrate stereotypes about violent black males . 
Editor-in-Chief <PERSON>Pat Harvey</PERSON> told me that he does not believe the media should put diminishing stereotypes ahead of objectivity on their agenda , though it is important to be informed and aware of them . 
He said that the paper would print the same mug shot of a white man as a black man ( or woman , for that matter ) who was accused of a major crime . 
This raises an extremely interesting question of the media 's role in race reporting . 
I 'm going to save that topic for a later column -- because I 'm sure , with race relations as tense as they are on Grounds right now , this will come up again . 
For now , I 'd just like to critique The Cavalier Daily 's coverage . 
While there was nothing particularly biased in the articles -- never was an accusatory or condemning word or sentence printed -- it 's what was missing from the articles that I found problematic . 
The man 's " side " of the story was never represented . 
The reader was left only with information from the police and an incriminating-looking mug shot . 
Of course , mug shots as a whole tend to look incriminating , which is partly why there should be a lot of thought that goes into using them . 
We do n't know what the man does for a living . 
We are not told if he has children , a wife , a family . 
None of them were given a chance to say any words on his behalf . 
If the family was contacted and chose not to comment , that fact should have been included . 
But crime reporting should not simply read like a rewritten press release from the police , who , after all , want the public to know they 're doing their job , catching criminals and keeping everyone safe . 
Where was the man arrested ? 
Did he surrender voluntarily ? 
Did he offer a sample of his DNA , or did the court force him to comply ? 
A reader suggested that The Cavalier Daily follow up with this man , whose name I have n't mentioned in this column -- it 's not necessary for my purposes . 
If he 's willing , it would be interesting to know what it would be like to be falsely accused of a crime and spend time in jail . 
What was it like facing his family ? 
People at work ? 
Is he afraid that even after he was released people will suspect him of the crime or others ? 
As for the photo , the front-page mug shot , in my opinion , was not necessary because the man was not a fugitive . 
If the police had been looking for someone , it would make sense to put his image out there for everyone to see . 
A smaller photo , possibly on the second page , might have done just as well . 
However , <PERSON>Harvey</PERSON> is right to hold objectivity over diminishing stereotypes , and I believe that they tried their best to treat the man fairly . 
The paper should be applauded for following up with a prominently placed article about the case of mistaken identity . 
In the future , though , I 'd like to see every attempt made to include all voices in stories -- however hard it may be to try to talk to families of victims or the accused . 
Those voices , after all , are the ones that drew us to the profession in the first place : The voices of the underrepresented , powerless and afflicted .
