Will Brumas | The Cavalier Daily In the aftermath of the Rolling Stone article , the administration and the BoV hired a law firm to independently review the case . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> heard an oral report last week from <ORGANIZATION>O'Melveny</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>LLP</ORGANIZATION> on the status of their independent review of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> 's response to the <DATE>2012</DATE> sexual assault detailed in Rolling Stone . 
The firm is scheduled to release a final written report in early <DATE>April</DATE> . 
" That review will include an evaluation of whether the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's response was and is in compliance with the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's stated policies and procedures , as well as with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations , " University spokesperson <PERSON>Anthony de Bruyn</PERSON> said . 
" The review is fully independent and decisions as to the investigative steps and approaches taken rest solely in the discretion of the firm . " 
Attorney <ORGANIZATION>General Mark Herring</ORGANIZATION> appointed <ORGANIZATION>O'Melveny</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> last <DATE>November</DATE> to conduct an outside assessment , which will supplement the investigation released by the <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Department</ORGANIZATION> last <DATE>Monday</DATE> . 
<PERSON>Michael Kelly</PERSON> , director of communications for the <ORGANIZATION>Attorney General</ORGANIZATION> , said it was important for <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> to be aware of its actions in these particular situations . 
" It is important that the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community has an accurate picture of what happened and how the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> responded , " <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> said . 
Gov. <PERSON>Terry McAuliffe</PERSON> established the <ORGANIZATION>Task Force on Combating Campus Sexual Violence</ORGANIZATION> through Executive Order 25 , which was issued in <DATE>Aug. 2014</DATE> . 
The declaration was signed by the presidents of all 16 public colleges and universities in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , including University President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> , in an effort to end campus sexual violence . 
The task force is responsible for recommending practices for preventing sexual violence and examining protocol for helping survivors . 
It will provide a final report to <ORGANIZATION>McAuliffe</ORGANIZATION> by <DATE>June 1 , 2015</DATE> . 
While Herring is involved in both the independent review and the task force , <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> noted the two remain distinct bodies . 
" They are two separate issues , " <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> said . 
" The task force predates the Rolling Stone article and is more of a holistic look rather than focusing on one report . " 
Upon the release of the report , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will work with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> , the Governor 's Office , and the Attorney General to make available any findings that do not violate federal privacy limitations . 
Board of Visitors member <PERSON>Frank Atkinson</PERSON> spoke earlier in the semester at a College Republicans meeting on the upcoming release of the <ORGANIZATION>O'Melveny</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> report . 
" I 'm hopeful all the facts will come out , " <PERSON>Atkinson</PERSON> said . 
" They will be helpful in understanding what happened and restoring reputation and status . 
As awful as [ the article ] was about the culture of <ORGANIZATION>UVA</ORGANIZATION> , it fed the narrative seen on Law and Order that sometimes colleges are interested in protecting their reputations , so they hush up about things like this . 
The question is , have we been supportive of survivors and encouraging [ them ] to go to law enforcement ? " 
To complement the report , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> has contracted the consulting firm <ORGANIZATION>Pepper Hamilton , LLP</ORGANIZATION> to receive guidance on the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's handling of sexual and gender-based harassment and violence complaints . 
The firm will especially examine reporting cases under federal law under the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education</ORGANIZATION> , de <PERSON>Bruyn</PERSON> said . 
" Pepper <PERSON>Hamilton</PERSON> 's services will include assistance and support regarding new and ongoing Title IX sexual assault reports and cases , implementation of current and proposed Title IX sexual assault policies , protocols involving local law enforcement , an assessment of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's policies , procedures and practices with respect to the federal laws , " de <PERSON>Bruyn</PERSON> said . 
In addition to the work of <ORGANIZATION>O'Melveny</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Myers</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pepper Hamilton</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> formed an Ad <ORGANIZATION>Hoc Group on University Climate and Culture</ORGANIZATION> to explore the policies , practices and organizational structure of safety and security on Grounds . 
" The ad hoc group includes three working groups focused on prevention , response and culture , " de <PERSON>Bruyn</PERSON> said . 
" Progress will be tracked in the short - , medium - and long-term . 
The work of <ORGANIZATION>Pepper Hamilton LLP</ORGANIZATION> and the Ad <ORGANIZATION>Hoc Group on University Climate and Culture</ORGANIZATION> remains ongoing . "
