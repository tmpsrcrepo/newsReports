Kelsey Grant | The Cavalier Daily " We are still discussing this particular role with the <ORGANIZATION>General Counsel</ORGANIZATION> 's office and professional staff in Student Health , " Groves wrote . 
" At present , these students are not required to report sexual assaults that are discussed with them by other students when they are acting in a peer advising role . " 
Since rolling out a new mandatory reporting policy on sexual assault this <DATE>August</DATE> , the role of various <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employees , including student employees , remains ambiguous . 
The new policy requires most faculty and staff , except for employees who are in health care or counseling positions , to report incidents of sexual misconduct they hear from students , identifying them as " responsible employees . " 
Those who work in health care or in counseling positions are considered " confidential employees , " removing them from the reporting requirement . 
" Defining faculty and staff roles will help students decide whom to approach when seeking help , " University President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> said in her <DATE>August</DATE> email to members of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community . 
" Some students may prefer to talk with a confidential source first , while others may want to pursue a more formal reporting approach . " 
But the difference between being a " responsible employee " and a " confidential employee " in the newly-enacted policy remains somewhat nebulous . 
Many <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employees say they act as counsellors , though counselling may not be their primary job . 
Dean of <ORGANIZATION>Students Allen Groves</ORGANIZATION> said in the new policy , Residential Advisors are required to report incidents of sexual assault , but only when they are operating in their role of RA . 
" For example , if they are speaking with a resident , then yes , " <PERSON>Groves</PERSON> said in an email . 
" If they are speaking with a friend in the third-year class , then no . " 
<PERSON>Katie Somers</PERSON> , fourth-year College student and housing and residence life co-chair , said Resident Staff members have always been required to report , given that they have a role as mandatory reporters as agents of the state . 
Therefore , the requirement of RAs to report sexual assault is not new for <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Groves said Teaching Assistants are required to report sexual assault under the new policy as well , but again only when acting in their role as a TA . " 
[ Teaching Assistants ] are mandatory reporters only when operating as a TA , " <PERSON>Groves</PERSON> said . 
" For example , when speaking with a student in the class or lab they are staffing as a TA . " 
Other University student employees , such as <ORGANIZATION>Orientation Leaders</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Newcomb Hall</ORGANIZATION> staff members and library employees , are also required to report sexual assault under the new policy , <PERSON>Groves</PERSON> said . 
Groves said administrators have not yet decided if <ORGANIZATION>University Peer Health Educators</ORGANIZATION> , a group of 45 students trained to educate their classmates about college health and wellness , will be required to report incidents of sexual assault under the new policy . 
" We are still discussing this particular role with the <ORGANIZATION>General Counsel</ORGANIZATION> 's office and professional staff in Student Health , " Groves wrote . 
" At present , these students are not required to report sexual assaults that are discussed with them by other students when they are acting in a peer advising role . " 
University employees and students may file a report of sexual misconduct by contacting the police , the Office of the Dean of Students or anonymously through the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> sexual violence website . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> also encourages employees to report sexual assault on the " Just Report It " system , an online tool which facilitates reporting sexual misconduct . 
On the website , " Responsible Employees Reporting Student Sexual Misconduct " is listed as an option . 
Responsible employees are allowed to disclose information shared by a student by completing a form . 
Through the deliberation of an experienced panel , <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> may honor a student 's confidentiality , but only if it can preserve a safe , non-discriminatory milieu for the community . 
Confidential resources , such as the <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Assault Resource Agency</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>University Counseling and Psychological Services</ORGANIZATION> , Shelter for Help in Emergency and the <ORGANIZATION>University Women</ORGANIZATION> 's Center counseling , are all available to provide counseling to any <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> members regarding issues of sexual assault . 
" All of us work together to create a caring community at U.Va. , one in which our students can live and learn here without fear of violence or harassment , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> 's <DATE>August</DATE> email read . 
" Yet we know that incidents of violence - including sexual violence - do sometimes occur . 
We are taking several new measures at <LOCATION>U.Va</LOCATION> . 
to confront this problem . "
