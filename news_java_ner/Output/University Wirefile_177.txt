<PERSON>Earl Washington Jr.</PERSON> , who spent nine and a half years on death row before being pardoned by former Republican Gov. <PERSON>James S. Gilmore</PERSON> in <DATE>2000</DATE> , has filed a suit alleging that those involved in his <DATE>1982</DATE> conviction for the rape and murder of a <LOCATION>Culpeper</LOCATION> woman violated his constitutional rights . 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , who once came within nine days of execution , was released in <DATE>2001</DATE> after DNA evidence linked the crime to another man . 
<LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> is seeking unspecified compensatory damages . 
The suit , filed <DATE>Monday</DATE> in the <ORGANIZATION>Vinegar Hill U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> , alleges that defendants who include <LOCATION>Fauquier County</LOCATION> , the city of <LOCATION>Culpeper</LOCATION> and several state investigators made a " concerted effort , acting under the color of state law , to convict him for these brutal crimes despite the total absence of evidence against him . " 
The suit also accuses current <ORGANIZATION>Culpeper Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> Attorney <PERSON>Gary Close</PERSON> , who did not prosecute <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 's case , of defamation of character alleging Close " publicly claimed that [ <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> ] had in fact committed the sexual assault and murder even after the DNA exoneration and absolute pardon . " 
The suit claims that the defendants fed <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> information about the crime in order to secure a false confession from him . 
In addition , the suit claims the defendants suppressed and ignored evidence and deliberately chose not to perform forensic tests that would have exonerated him . 
<PERSON>Victor Glasberg</PERSON> , one of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 's lawyers , attributed the defendants ' alleged misconduct to hubris . 
" They did n't see the significance of the evidence that would have exonerated <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> because they did n't want to see it , " <PERSON>Glasberg</PERSON> said . 
" They had a good prospect . " 
<PERSON>Glasberg</PERSON> said it was important to compensate <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for his losses . 
" A terrible wrong was done to <PERSON>Earl Washington</PERSON> and he 's entitled to compensation , " <PERSON>Glasberg</PERSON> said . 
" He spent nine years on death row , how in God 's name can you compensate for that ? " 
he added . 
" The only thing you can try to do is to put some kind of value in the coin of the realm . " 
<PERSON>Glasberg</PERSON> said that beyond compensating <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , the suit is important because it is illustrative of the weaknesses inherent in our justice system . 
" We live in a country where by and large people who are convicted of crimes tend to be guilty of them , " he said . 
" This case , however , highlights the unfortunate fact that our courts , including our courts of appeal , are fallible . 
Human beings are fallible . " 
According to <PERSON>Glasberg</PERSON> , capital cases magnify the importance of this fallibility . 
" This is an awesome concept because when you are dealing with a capital crime you are dealing with the decision to kill someone , " <PERSON>Glasberg</PERSON> added . 
<PERSON>Jack Payden</PERSON> , director of Virginians for Alternatives to the <ORGANIZATION>Death Penalty</ORGANIZATION> , said <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 's case demonstrates a peculiarity of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's court system -- the 21 day rule . 
Current <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> law only allows for the introduction of new evidence up to 21 days after the last day of court proceedings . 
" His case brings up an important issue for <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and one which voters will get some chance to correct in <DATE>November</DATE> at the polls , " <ORGANIZATION>Payden</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" <LOCATION>Earl Washington</LOCATION> was released due to DNA testing but was denied a new trial , instead he had to be pardoned by the governor . " 
Payden added that in the <DATE>November</DATE> elections voters will decide whether to ratify an amendment to the state constitution which would allow for the introduction of biological evidence like the evidence used to exonerate <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> beyond 21 days .
