Local <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> , officials spoke out against <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> , legislation at <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> 's <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> meeting . 
Council members voted four-to-one to pass a resolution urging the repeal of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>House Bill 751</ORGANIZATION> , an amendment to the <DATE>1997</DATE> Affirmation of Marriage Act . 
The <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> law , which took effect across the Commonwealth <DATE>July 1</DATE> , prohibits " partnership contract ( s ) or other arrangement ( s ) between persons of the same sex purporting to bestow the privileges or obligations of marriage . " 
The law has raised concern and controversy across <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and locally here in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> . 
" A significant portion of the citizens of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> are affected by the Affirmation of Marriage Act , " said Council Member <PERSON>Blake Caravati</PERSON> , who initiated <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> 's resolution at the meeting . 
" Many of those people have approached me . " 
Caravati has opposed the legislation since last year when he began lobbying the <ORGANIZATION>House of Delegates</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> . 
The resolution <PERSON>Caravati</PERSON> proposed to the council calls on the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> to repeal <ORGANIZATION>House Bill 751</ORGANIZATION> , noting that the law " takes <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> out of the mainstream of the laws of the other 49 states of the <LOCATION>Union</LOCATION> . " 
The resolution recognizes other potential detrimental effects of the law , including loss of tourism and business to the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> , the cost of legislation and the limitations it places on the rights of same-sex couples . 
" My movement was not based on religious or moral values , " <PERSON>Caravati</PERSON> said . 
" It was only based on civil rights . " 
Many worry that the law 's vague guidelines leave room for implicit effects . 
The resolution also notes the threat the law presents to partners ' power of attorney , custody rights and medical directives . 
" In voting against <ORGANIZATION>House Bill 751</ORGANIZATION> and in favor of the resolution ; I feel like I am standing up for fairness , " council member <PERSON>Kendra Hamilton</PERSON> said . 
Council member <PERSON>Rob Schilling</PERSON> voted against the resolution , urging <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> residents concerned about the law 's effect to contact their state and federal representatives directly . 
<PERSON>Schilling</PERSON> said he is concerned the council " overestimates its own importance " in evaluating laws of the <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> . 
A host of <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> residents attended the council meeting and voiced a range of opinions . 
" This is a vicious piece of legislation that has harmed a lot of people already , " said <PERSON>Claire Kaplan</PERSON> , <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> resident and <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> 's sexual assault education coordinator , at the meeting . 
The law has had a negative effect on the university 's recruitment efforts , <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> told the council . 
Potential faculty members have eliminated the university from their consideration because of the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> legislation , she said . 
Others suggested that the assertions made by the council 's resolution about the negative effects of the bill are assumptions . 
" The resolution was simply in bad form , " said <PERSON>Harold L. Bare Sr.</PERSON> , pastor at <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Covenant Church</ORGANIZATION> . 
" If it is going to be a resolution of opinion , it should indicate opinion . 
" Many of the resolution 's points lacked supporting research and was rather based on assumptive statements , Bare said . 
Bare offered the council <MONEY>$ 1,000</MONEY> to survey <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> residents on their opinions concerning the legislation , noting that research suggests that most Americans support traditional forms of marriage . 
Council will now move forward with the goals of the resolution by meeting with local legislators to encourage them to propose a bill that would repeal HB 751 , <PERSON>Caravati</PERSON> said . 
However , there is some skepticism as to the ability of the resolution to have an effect in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> . 
" In a technical sense , what [ <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> ] did [ <DATE>Monday</DATE> ] night is not a point of law , it is only a resolution , " Bare said . 
" It does n't change the law . "
