IN <DATE>2007</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>King of Pop</ORGANIZATION> will reclaim his rightful throne . 
According to several reports , <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> has been working on a new album , to be released later this year , with red-hot performer " will.i.am " of the Black Eyed Peas . 
Several songs already have been recorded and the album should be finished shortly , which would represent <PERSON>Michael Jackon</PERSON> 's first album of completely new material since the release of Invincible in <DATE>2001</DATE> . 
The most impressive achievement of this album , however , would be to restore <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> 's iconic status and recapture lost glory by transforming the way people think about him , putting the focus back on the music and away from his personal life . 
During the <DATE>1980s</DATE> , <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> was the biggest music icon in the world . 
Released in <DATE>December 1982</DATE> , Thriller , the greatest selling album of all time , defined '80s pop and catapulted <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> 's fame to uncharted heights . 
According to <ORGANIZATION>Guinness World Records</ORGANIZATION> , Thriller has sold well over 100 million copies worldwide ; no other album even comes close . 
The King of Pop scored nine number-one singles in the Hot 100 during the decade , more than any other artist . 
His fame dwarfed that of any other human on the planet ; in <DATE>1997</DATE> , a survey found that <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> was the most famous person in the world , beating out President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> and Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> , according to his biography on <ORGANIZATION>IMDB</ORGANIZATION> . 
God would probably have been the only entity humans recognized more , and God 's existence is in dispute ! 
A series of controversies surrounding his personal life , however , gradually removed the focus from his music , although <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> continued to have phenomenal worldwide success throughout the <DATE>1990s</DATE> , releasing chart-toppers like Dangerous ( <DATE>1991</DATE> ) and HIStory ( <DATE>1995</DATE> ) along with Blood on the <ORGANIZATION>Dance Floor</ORGANIZATION> ( <DATE>1997</DATE> ) , which became the greatest selling remix album ever . 
Nevertheless , his activities with children at <ORGANIZATION>Neverland Ranch</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> received increasingly skeptical attention . 
In <DATE>1993</DATE> , he responded to accusations of child molestation by settling out-of-court for an undisclosed sum of money . 
Over a decade later , he stood trial for child molestation , but was acquitted on all charges in <DATE>June 2005</DATE> . 
Following a few travels after the trial , <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> has returned to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and now hopes that those glittering gloves will shine as brightly as they once did . 
His chances for continued success are very real , but to better understand the inquiry , the upcoming album must be placed in the context of <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> 's status as a cultural icon , not merely his musical prowess . 
Once upon a time , almost everything associated with <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> was , well , " cool , " from the moonwalk to the way he adorned his fedora hat at the start of " Billie Jean " performances . 
As the <ORGANIZATION>Rock</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Roll Hall of Fame</ORGANIZATION> explains , <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> " enjoyed a level of superstardom previously known only to <LOCATION>Elvis Presley</LOCATION> , the Beatles , and <PERSON>Frank Sinatra</PERSON> . " 
Today , however , when many people think of <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> , they are often struck by preconceptions of an aloof individual who did horrible things to his face and molested children . 
<PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> 's iconic image has been heavily bruised , but it 's not completely gone , and if anyone has the talent to revive his or her career , it 's <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> . 
The <DATE>2007</DATE> album must seize on that hope that remains to rescue his status by shifting those negative public perceptions . 
After all , he does not have anything more to prove musically . 
He has established himself as one of the greatest dancers ever , if not the greatest , and his vocals are legendary , a fact still recognized by will , who has praised the <ORGANIZATION>King of Pop</ORGANIZATION> 's singing and just about everything else relating to <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> 's musical genius . 
He is one of the greatest selling artists ever , has won 13 Grammy awards , charted 13 number one Hot 100 singles in his solo career , and has set whopping concert attendance records through his global tours . 
This effort should be more about history and legacy ; unless someone as spectacular as the <DATE>1983</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Michael Jackson</ORGANIZATION> emerges , nothing will ever approach Thriller 's success for decades anyway . 
If all this new album does is get people to start thinking more about his music rather than his personal life , it would have been a success .
