In light of recent crimes occurring on and near <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia Grounds</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students are raising concerns about their safety . 
On <DATE>Feb. 23</DATE> , two masked men allegedly walked through the door of a suite in a <LOCATION>Lambeth Field</LOCATION> apartment , tied up the four residents with materials such as a pillowcase and a Velcro strap , and robbed them of their wallets and a watch . 
On <DATE>Monday</DATE> , <DATE>March 4</DATE> , a <ORGANIZATION>Faulkner Apartments</ORGANIZATION> resident reported that three men entered his suite and assaulted him at around <TIME>11:45 p.m</TIME> . 
The three men allegedly beat the victim with a chair , their feet and their fists . 
Most recently , on <DATE>March 17</DATE> - a <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> when most <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students were on <ORGANIZATION>Spring Break</ORGANIZATION> - two suspects , one of whom was armed , allegedly held up two male <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students outside 41 <ORGANIZATION>University Circle</ORGANIZATION> around <TIME>10:40 p.m</TIME> . 
The victims were unharmed and were able to recover their wallets and stolen personal items . 
In each of these incidents , suspects have been arrested and charged , but in the <ORGANIZATION>University Circle</ORGANIZATION> incident one suspect remains at large . 
Police have yet to determine whether these incidents are related to each other . 
Second-year College student <PERSON>Rica McKeveny</PERSON> , a Lambeth resident , said she thinks <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> and Resident Staff are doing the best they can to keep on-Grounds residents safe . 
The crimes " have n't affected the way I feel . 
Students have to take precautionary measures too , by not walking alone at <TIME>night</TIME> and locking their doors , " <PERSON>McKeveny</PERSON> said . 
She said <ORGANIZATION>Lambeth Resident Staff</ORGANIZATION> held a safety seminar with <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> police officers so Lambeth residents could ask questions and learn about potential safety risks as well as precautionary behavior . 
" It 's a combination of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> working with us and us also doing our part to be safe , " she said . 
" The Resident Coordinators are doing as much as they can . 
All they can do is tell people to be careful . 
Whether they lock their doors or not , is up to the residents . " 
Third-year College student <PERSON>Rebecca Hall</PERSON> who lives a few buildings down from the location of the recently reported <ORGANIZATION>University Circle</ORGANIZATION> assault , said recent crimes in the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community illustrate the lack of safe , properly kept off-Grounds housing . 
" It reflects on the poor state of housing here - there is n't enough housing on Grounds , " <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> said . 
She said she has not seen very many police officers around the <ORGANIZATION>University Circle</ORGANIZATION> area , only occasionally on some weekend nights . 
" Almost the only police that come down U-Circle are police ticketing people who are n't supposed to be parked there , " she added . 
McKeveny said she has seen more police officers on bicycles recently , including near the <ORGANIZATION>University Hall</ORGANIZATION> parking lot across the street from the Lambeth complex , where many students park when the Lambeth lot becomes full . 
The trek from the U-Hall parking lot back to Lambeth makes McKeveny uneasy . 
" It 's kind of scary for Lambeth people to walk back from U-Hall late at night , " she said . 
" Any little [ precautionary measure ] will make a difference . " 
She added that the recent crimes are serving as a " wake-up call " to <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community members who often do not realize crimes can occur anywhere . 
" It can happen anywhere , to anyone , " she said . 
<PERSON>Hall</PERSON> said she feels secure in her <ORGANIZATION>University Circle</ORGANIZATION> building . 
" I feel safe in my building because I live on the third floor . 
[ But ] our landlord is n't good about replacing broken screens , and the front and back doors are open all the time , " she said . 
<PERSON>Hall</PERSON> said she feels sorry for non-students who live on <ORGANIZATION>University Circle</ORGANIZATION> and who heard about the robbery . 
" The rent is expensive - and to have a robbery right out in front of their houses " reflects badly on the state of security near Grounds , she said . 
Because of the recent crimes and a general concern for the safety of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> students , the U.Va . 
Parents Program is working to give parents and students information about safe off-Grounds housing . 
U.Va . 
Parents Program Director <PERSON>Molly Bass</PERSON> said the Program is working with the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Crime Prevention Association</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> housing rental companies , <ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Blue Ridge Apartment Council</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Dean of Students Office</ORGANIZATION> to put together a booklet that outlines what constitutes safe housing and safe behavior as well as research on relevant state laws . 
The booklet will be helpful to both parents and students . 
" A residence with [ precautionary ] hardware , location and appearance may be safer than a resident without these , " <PERSON>Bass</PERSON> said . 
" We 're saying that we consider a residence to be safer with x , y and z [ precautionary features ] . " 
<ORGANIZATION>University Police</ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON>Michael Sheffield</PERSON> , who is also on the committee , said the information brochure will include a reference card with a checklist for parents and students to take with them when inspecting possible housing . 
" You can grade [ the housing unit ] yourself , and check for deadbolt locks , peepholes , landscaping and lighting , " <PERSON>Sheffield</PERSON> said . 
Bass said the housing laws in the booklet will enable parents to require subpar landlords to install the necessary equipment . 
" The hope is that the majority of rental units in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> will have safety features - as the public becomes more educated about safety standards , hopefully there will be a desire [ on the part of some landlords ] to conform , " <PERSON>Bass</PERSON> said . 
Some of the other tips the booklet will offer include recommendations from <ORGANIZATION>Student Council 's Safety Committee</ORGANIZATION> , such as replacing burnt-out lights and keeping up appearances around student housing areas so as not to attract possible criminals , Bass added . 
<PERSON>Sheffield</PERSON> said the main focus of the safety program is to foster a relationship between <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> and off-Grounds housing . 
" We all have the same interest in providing safety and security for the residents , " he said . 
" It makes the entire community a safer community - when someone does n't lock their doors or leaves windows open , it increases the risk for other homeowners . " 
Bass said the historical role of the Parents Program is to wait for proposals that would not get funding from <ORGANIZATION>Student Council</ORGANIZATION> or a mid-year project that was turned in too late for the appropriations process . 
But after the <DATE>Aug. 26 , 1999</DATE> , armed rape and assault of a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student in the <LOCATION>Venable</LOCATION> area , <PERSON>Bass</PERSON> said parents called and asked what they could do . 
<PERSON>Sheffield</PERSON> said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is slow in developing programs like these , " geared around crime prevention through environmental design " in student housing areas . 
When the committee sent their plans for this project to other colleges across the country , they replied saying they did not have such a program and wanted to see the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's program once it was completed . 
" We have some great security concepts that could be a model for other schools to use , " he said . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>University of Florida</ORGANIZATION> had a pretty good program , a result of some off-campus incidents they had . 
It was the only one we found that was comparable to us " in school size . 
Bass said the booklet , titled " Parents ' Safety and Security Guide for Off-Grounds Rental Housing , " will be sent to all parents in <DATE>June</DATE> .
