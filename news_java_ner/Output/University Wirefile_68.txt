Forget the stereotypical image of the dumb , blond beauty queen and instead imagine a highly intelligent , enthusiastic and strikingly beautiful Korean woman . 
Meet <PERSON>Michelle Kang</PERSON> , <LOCATION>Miss Virginia</LOCATION> <DATE>1996</DATE> . 
Kang is currently a graduate student at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Curry School of Education</ORGANIZATION> and will be graduating this <DATE>May</DATE> with an educational policy degree . 
Kang has tried to keep her presence at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> low key , so that she can be a student and not an icon . 
" People tend not to take me seriously because they want to only look at the outside , " <PERSON>Kang</PERSON> said . 
But now , <LOCATION>Miss Virginia</LOCATION> <DATE>1996</DATE> is coming out into the open for an incredible cause . 
Asst. Dean of Students <PERSON>John Foubert</PERSON> called Kang and asked her to emcee a benefit concert for the sexual assault peer education group , One in Four . 
Foubert met Kang last semester and knew of her strong interests . 
<PERSON>Michelle</PERSON> " had mentioned her work concerning the abuse of women and children , " <PERSON>Foubert</PERSON> said , " She is a strong supporter of the work I am doing and the work of One in Four . " 
The benefit concert , which will be held <DATE>Monday</DATE> at <TIME>8:30 p.m.</TIME> in <ORGANIZATION>McLeod Auditorium</ORGANIZATION> , will feature the musical groups AVP , ChoosE , <ORGANIZATION>Black Voices</ORGANIZATION> , the Sil ' hooettes and the Whethermen . 
Kang said her interest in the benefit stems from her reign as <LOCATION>Miss Virginia</LOCATION> , when she championed a few different issues that she still actively supports today . 
Her specific areas of concern are the prevention of child abuse , women 's issues and literacy . 
<PERSON>Kang</PERSON> said <DATE>April</DATE> is a month dedicated to the prevention of child abuse . 
She wears a blue ribbon pin every day of the month following the well-known story of a grandmother who started wearing blue ribbons to symbolize the blue bruises she observed on her grandchild 's arms . 
This practice is now national . 
Kang 's dedication to these causes is the reason she agreed to emcee the benefit concert . 
Kang emphasized that safety is one of her biggest women 's concerns . 
" It is so important not to take safety for granted , " she said . 
" Statistics show that one in four college women have been sexually assaulted . " 
Kang said she believes these statistics speak for themselves and are part of the reason the work One in Four does is so important . 
" I am so proud that men are doing this , " <PERSON>Kang</PERSON> said . 
Kang said she is looking forward to <DATE>Monday</DATE> 's concert , which will focus on prevention and not past tragedy . 
" It 's gong to be an upbeat , fun event , " she said . 
Kang is used to addressing groups as large as 2,000 people . 
During her term as <LOCATION>Miss Virginia</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Kang</PERSON> gave over 300 speeches and traveled over 1,000 miles a week to all areas of the commonwealth . 
Her title required her to act as a spokesperson , advocate and role model . 
In fact , <PERSON>Kang</PERSON> said these roles were the very reason she decided to enter the pageant in the first place . 
" I did it because I saw it as a unique opportunity , " she said . 
Unlike many contestants , <PERSON>Kang</PERSON> had never been in a pageant before and entered with a specific purpose in mind . 
" After interning for a juvenile court judge for two summers and serving as a CASA [ Court Appointed Special Advocate ] for an abused child , I wanted to find a way to draw more attention to the needs of children , " she said . 
Kang said she even testified before the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Senate Committee</ORGANIZATION> as a public advocate for the well being of children and families . 
She said she did legislative work in order to remind people that citizens have the power to influence government . 
" Up until me , everyone viewed <LOCATION>Miss Virginia</LOCATION> as a beauty queen and nothing more , " <PERSON>Kang</PERSON> said . 
" I pushed for people to take me seriously , as a business person . " 
Kang also holds the distinguished position in history as <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's first minority pageant winner . 
Kang grew up in <LOCATION>Fredricksburg</LOCATION> as the daughter of Koran immigrants . 
She also notes that she was one of only a small number of Asians in her high school . 
" My sister and I made up the Asian population in our school , " she said . 
As the first minority <LOCATION>Miss Virginia</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Kang</PERSON> said she encountered some racism . 
She said during parades some people would boo her . 
Through all of it , she added that she retained her positive outlook and did not let others ' ignorance affect her and her job . 
" You ca n't change them , just try and educate them , " <PERSON>Kang</PERSON> said . 
Through her work for children and the abused , as well as her role as a minority leader , <PERSON>Kang</PERSON> recognizes what an opportunity she got out of being <LOCATION>Miss Virginia</LOCATION> . 
" <LOCATION>Miss Virginia</LOCATION> is only a job title , " she said . 
" It is not all about the crown , glitz and glamour . 
It is about making a difference in people 's lives . "
