Rape , assault , cheating on tests , police brutality , excessive drinking and sports scandals are racking higher education . 
We are seeing an explosion of high profile news that is clearly the exception of life in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's universities and colleges . 
Clearly most students are serious , responsible , hard working and respectful of each other . 
That 's not news . 
We do n't report when tens of thousands of airplanes take off and land safely . 
We obsess when an airliner crashes and people die . 
Bad news inevitably is the news . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> is exceptionally plagued by rolling bad news . 
Now we are confronted with the headline " Police find no evidence in Rolling Stone investigation , suspend inquiry . " 
You all know the details : " Police launched [ an ] investigation in <DATE>November</DATE> at the request of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> after [ Rolling Stone ] magazine published an article detailing a graphic sexual assault of a then-first year student . . . in <DATE>Sept. 2012</DATE> at a fraternity house . 
The fraternity at the center of the initial fervor was cleared of any involvement in the incident back in <DATE>January</DATE> . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Phi Kappa Psi</ORGANIZATION> fraternity , where the incident allegedly took place , has been irreparably damaged and its members apparently slandered . 
The organization and many of its members are now condemned to permanent damage in an unforgiving Internet environment where nothing ever goes away . 
Obviously as they say in politics , " mistakes were made . " 
Rolling Stone violated every principle of responsible journalism in publishing an un-vetted story by a reporter who never bothered to verify the horrible story . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administration bypassed due diligence in not deploying its legal team to follow up on this incident . 
In this case they just " trusted " and did not " verify . " 
Most of journalism also ran with the original story and did not approach such a devastating narrative with special care and responsibility . 
Many organizations at U.Va . 
who jumped on board the bandwagon of this saga also deserve our condemnation . 
Their actions were driven by the mob mentality that surrounded this story from the day the Rolling Stone article ran . 
How do we now " walk back " all of this , repair the damage if possible and set a precedent that will encourage more responsible treatment and verification of future incidents ? 
In the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> we should always correct the damage we do , whether in a car accident or a social and legal train wreck such as this . 
Lawsuits with very large damages awarded to the parties that have been damaged are in order . 
Clearly Rolling Stone is going to be the primary object of litigation . 
However , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> administrators who often hide behind pious shields and the fact that they woe for a " public " institution must not be let off the hook - no catch and release for them . 
Some of the news media who ran with the story without fact-checking also need a major monetary punishment slammed on them . 
There are consequences to erroneous and irresponsible reporting . 
This tragic story should serve as a lesson in caution and responsibility . 
I am an optimist and do n't believe there is an existential crisis in higher education . 
I do think there are problems that need to be corrected but with prudence , responsibility and diligence .
