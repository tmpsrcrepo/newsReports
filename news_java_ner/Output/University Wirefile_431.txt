Will Brumas | The Cavalier Daily " Defining faculty and staff roles will help students decide whom to approach when seeking help , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" Some students may prefer to talk with a confidential source first , while others may want to pursue a more formal reporting approach . " 
In an email to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> community <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> announced a new <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> policy requiring most faculty and staff to report allegations of sexual misconduct they hear from students . 
In her email , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said initial conversations after incidents of sexual assault are particularly important . 
" Defining faculty and staff roles will help students decide whom to approach when seeking help , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> said . 
" Some students may prefer to talk with a confidential source first , while others may want to pursue a more formal reporting approach . " 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> simultaneously launched an informational website for faculty , staff and students which included background information about sexual assault , an <ORGANIZATION>FAQ</ORGANIZATION> section and a reporting feature . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will now consider most employees to be " Responsible Employees , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> wrote . 
Those employees must send information about sexual assault directly to <ORGANIZATION>Title IX Coordinator Darlene Scott-Scurry</ORGANIZATION> . 
Faculty and staff can do so through a secure online reporting system . 
" Employees who are in health-care or counseling positions are considered Confidential Employees , and they are not required to report to the Title IX Coordinator , " <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> wrote . 
Counselors or nurses in the emergency room , then , are not bound by reporting requirements . 
Participants in public events , such as Take Back the <TIME>Night</TIME> , during which survivors of sexual assault share their stories , do not need to worry about the reporting requirement . 
The reporting website 's FAQs section does not directly address student employees , such as those on work-study or those interning for various <ORGANIZATION>University and Health System departments</ORGANIZATION> . 
However , it quotes the official policy saying responsible employees are " any <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> employee who is not a Confidential Employee . " 
In her email , <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> urged employees to examine online materials , but did not mention any additional training employees should undergo . 
According to the policy , however , employees must prepare to take on these new responsibilities . 
" University employees are also required to complete training in order to understand their responsibilities in this area , including how to respond to disclosures by students of alleged Sexual Misconduct , " according to the policy , dated <DATE>Aug. 25</DATE> . 
A three-member <ORGANIZATION>Evaluation Panel</ORGANIZATION> will decide whether the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> should pursue a <ORGANIZATION>Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> case despite a survivor request for confidentiality . 
The Dean of Students , the Title IX Coordinator and a member of the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Threat Assessment Team</ORGANIZATION> will sit on the panel . 
For example , if a student asks a professor to keep an occurrence of sexual assault confidential , the faculty member is not permitted to honor the request . 
Instead , the faculty member must report the incident and also report the student 's desire for no further investigation . 
The three-member <ORGANIZATION>Evaluation Panel</ORGANIZATION> will then determine whether to investigate further , based on additional evidence available or patterns of the accused 's behavior . 
The <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> investigates all complaints separate from the police , and the <ORGANIZATION>University 's Sexual Misconduct Board</ORGANIZATION> possesses separate sanctioning authority . 
In other words , a <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> investigation does not necessitate a simultaneous law enforcement investigation . 
Dean of <ORGANIZATION>Students Allen Groves</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> adopted the policy from one the federal government recently released as a model for schools . 
" We believe it accurately reflects the current Title IX regulatory expectations for all institutions of higher education across the country , " <PERSON>Groves</PERSON> said in an email . 
Title IX is part of the Education Amendments of <DATE>1972</DATE> and prohibits discrimination based on sex in institutions receiving federal financial aid , such as the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Title IX covers issues such as sexual harassment and gender equality in sports .
