The vacuum left by <PERSON>Vance Wilkins</PERSON> ' resignation from the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia House</ORGANIZATION> speakership will likely be filled by <PERSON>William Howell</PERSON> , R-Stafford , who graduated from the <ORGANIZATION>University Law School</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1967</DATE> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> will meet <DATE>Saturday</DATE> to nominate a new speaker .

Beach . 
<PERSON>Howell</PERSON> is currently the chair of the <ORGANIZATION>Courts of Justice</ORGANIZATION> committee . 
<PERSON>Howell</PERSON> said his work as chair of the influential courts committee prepared him well for the position of speaker . 
" I 've enjoyed the responsibility of the committee , " <PERSON>Howell</PERSON> said . 
" I think I 'll have the same work ethic as speaker . " 
Wilkins resigned from the speakership in <DATE>June</DATE> following allegations that he settled a <MONEY>$ 100,000</MONEY> sexual harassment case , and announced this week that he will resign from his seat in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> . 
Del . 
<PERSON>Harry J. Parrish</PERSON> , R-Manassas , who chairs the finance committee that <PERSON>Howell</PERSON> sits on , described his colleague as " quiet , but a strong leader . " 
He added that <PERSON>Howell</PERSON> is a " very religious person and a consensus builder . " 
<PERSON>Howell</PERSON> described himself as " not a high profile type of person . " 
According to politics professor <PERSON>Larry J. Sabato</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> members chose to support <PERSON>Howell</PERSON> because he represents a change of pace from <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> . 
" The republicans actively looked for a low-profile , congenial and collegial squeaky-clean speaker , " <PERSON>Sabato</PERSON> said . 
" That is the polar-opposite of <PERSON>Vance Wilkins</PERSON> . " 
Sabato compared <PERSON>Howell</PERSON> 's appointment to that of <ORGANIZATION>Gerald Ford</ORGANIZATION> 's as <PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON> 's vice president following <PERSON>Spiro Agnew</PERSON> 's resignation . 
Ford was chosen to replace <PERSON>Agnew</PERSON> because of his non-controversial personality , which offset the scandal-ridden <PERSON>Nixon</PERSON> administration . 
Del . 
<PERSON>Robert Hurt</PERSON> , R-Chatham , acknowledged that <PERSON>Howell</PERSON> is a different sort of politician than <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> was . 
<PERSON>Howell</PERSON> " has a different style than <PERSON>Vance Wilkins</PERSON> , " he said . 
But according to <LOCATION>Del</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>William R. Janis</PERSON> , R-Short Pump , the dissimilarity between <PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> and <PERSON>Howell</PERSON> is not overly significant . 
" I would n't read too much into the contrast between [ <PERSON>Howell</PERSON> ] and <PERSON>Vance Wilkins</PERSON> , " said <PERSON>Janis</PERSON> , who serves on the <ORGANIZATION>Courts of Justice</ORGANIZATION> committee with <PERSON>Howell</PERSON> . 
Parrish also denied that <PERSON>Howell</PERSON> was chosen because of his affable front . 
" I do n't think [ personality ] entered into it , " he said . 
Sabato spoke optimistically of the implications of having a speaker who attended the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" <PERSON>Howell</PERSON> 's selection could be good news for the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Sabato</PERSON> said . 
" It matters enormously what the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> " thinks of <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Wilkins</PERSON> was " a Hokie through and through , " he added . 
<PERSON>Howell</PERSON> will not officially become speaker until <DATE>January</DATE> when the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> reconvenes .
