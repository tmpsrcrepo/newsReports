There seem to be two general attitudes concerning fraternities . 
On one hand , they 're great , they throw parties and give out free beer . 
On the other , they 're suspicious , with stories of date rape and questionable activities with goats . 
This divided mindset is the main theme in <ORGANIZATION>Jock Young</ORGANIZATION> 's novel and fictional expose , " Epsilon Zeta . " 
The novel traces the rise and fall of the <ORGANIZATION>Gamma Nu</ORGANIZATION> chapter of the Epsilon Zeta fraternity at fictional <ORGANIZATION>Northwestern Florida University</ORGANIZATION> . 
According to <ORGANIZATION>Young</ORGANIZATION> , fraternities are about politics , sex , drugs , drinking and communal baths -- they are ancient <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> . 
Much of what happens in this book is designed to shock and disgust the reader , which <ORGANIZATION>Young</ORGANIZATION> accomplishes nicely . 
For example , at one point , several guys have sex with the same drunk girl . 
Women beware : After reading this book you will intensely dislike frat brothers and possibly men in general . 
The novel begins by exposing all the nitty-gritty , disgusting details of fraternities almost as fast as it can reasonably include them in the plot . 
It leaves no profanity unsaid and no sexual encounter unshared . 
However , as the story progresses , it grows more positive , finally touching on the ideas of brotherhood and loyalty . 
However , in this fraternity , even these ideals are controversial . 
The brothers of <ORGANIZATION>Epsilon Zeta</ORGANIZATION> are as petty , gossipy and cliquish as the girls on " <LOCATION>Laguna Beach</LOCATION> . " 
The novel never resolves ; it never chooses to be for or against frats . 
It ends with the same divided mind that it began with , which perhaps is ultimately the best way to look at fraternities . 
The book is not particularly remarkable in terms of writing style or of character development , but , in fairness , that is not the novel 's main concern . 
It aims to present a picture of fraternities that is realistic and unglorified . 
To really know whether it has succeeded , one must be in a fraternity . 
" Epsilon Zeta " is highly entertaining . 
Whether you 're a " Life Loyal Member " of a fraternity or an ardent feminist , you will enjoy this book . 
It 's like reading the secret diary of fraternities .
