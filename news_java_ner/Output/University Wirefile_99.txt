After hearing testimony from defendant <PERSON>Montaret Davis</PERSON> and listening to closing arguments yesterday , a six-man , six-woman jury deliberated for three hours on charges of rape and armed robbery . 
They will continue to consider the case against <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> today . 
Davis faces 16 felony charges , including rape , robbery , forcible sodomy and the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony following his <DATE>Oct. 5</DATE> arrest for an <DATE>Aug. 26</DATE> rape and armed robbery in the home of a female <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student as her male friend was held at gunpoint . 
The trial began <DATE>Monday</DATE> , and continued yesterday with the prosecution 's continued focus on forensic evidence with three forensic science experts taking the stand . 
But <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> ' testimony was the focal point of yesterday 's proceedings . 
After <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> ' girlfriend and an <ORGANIZATION>Outback Lodge</ORGANIZATION> employee testified on his behalf , <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> calmly gave his account of what happened in the <DATE>early morning of Aug. 26</DATE> , contradicting the two victims ' previous testimonies . 
Davis described to the jury his version of events on the <TIME>evening</TIME> of <DATE>Aug. 25</DATE> - his birthday . 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> testified that he was at a party where he drank a fair amount of alcohol and smoked marijuana . 
He said he then received a phone call from a female <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> student who told him they had met at a fraternity party in <DATE>1998</DATE> . 
He said she wanted to buy marijuana from him . 
He contended he made plans to meet the woman at the <LOCATION>Outback Lodge</LOCATION> <TIME>later that evening</TIME> . 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said the woman called back later to say she could not make it and to meet her at her house on 17th Street . 
He testified the woman was on the porch and led him inside , after calling him by his nickname , " <DATE>Friday</DATE> . " 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said the woman was unable to pay for the marijuana so they made an arrangement that she would pay for the deal with sex . 
He testified they then had consensual sex with a condom . 
But Commonwealth Attorney <PERSON>David Chapman</PERSON> recalled <ORGANIZATION>Detective M.R. Bishop</ORGANIZATION> and asked if there was a condom found at the scene , to which the detective replied " no . " 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said he never met the other alleged victim in the case and that he did not carry a gun with him . 
The two defense witnesses testified that they did not know <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> to carry a gun . 
<PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> , in his cross-examination of <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> , questioned why <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> initially had denied being at the scene when first questioned by police . 
<PERSON>Davis</PERSON> said he did not know which night the police were questioning him about . 
In his closing statement , <PERSON>Chapman</PERSON> argued that <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> settled on his " sex for drugs defense " after his first two plans - an alibi with <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> ' girlfriend and further DNA testing - fell through . 
Chapman also said the defense never asked the female victim if she knew someone named " <DATE>Friday</DATE> , " thereby weakening their case . 
Defense attorney <PERSON>Lloyd J. Snook III</PERSON> emphasized that the burden of proof lies with the prosecution . 
He argued that the prosecution 's case rested on inconsistencies and that the victims ' testimonies not only contradicted each other , but were contradicted by physical evidence . 
Snook moved to strike the charges of attempted robbery and the use of a firearm in the commission of attempted robbery . 
Judge <PERSON>Joseph F. Spinella</PERSON> struck down the two charges .
