<PERSON>Porter Dickie</PERSON> | The <ORGANIZATION>Cavalier Daily Student Council</ORGANIZATION> approved the creation of the <ORGANIZATION>Committee on Safety Programs</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , under which two new programs - Student Watch and Buddies on Call - were also officially approved . 
College Representative <PERSON>Klaus Dollhopf</PERSON> , a fifth-year <ORGANIZATION>College</ORGANIZATION> student , said the committee would fall under the Vice President for <ORGANIZATION>Administration</ORGANIZATION> - fourth-year College student Sky <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> - and would oversee all programs created underneath it . 
" It will be composed of six members , at least one of them being from the <ORGANIZATION>Safety and Wellness Committee</ORGANIZATION> [ to ] provide a bridge between the two committees , " he said . 
" These programs will be able to function autonomously , but they will subject to any changes the committee wants to make . " 
Dollhopf said this process is similar of that to ULink , which began as a program under <ORGANIZATION>Council 's Academic Affairs Committee</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We have n't found a better alternative , and there is a desire for this to be created , " he said . 
" This is the best way . " 
Council voted to have the committee be an ad hoc committee which will cease operation if no programs are in operation under its control . 
Council will also vote at the end of each semester on whether to continue the operation and existence of the committee . 
To fall under the new committee , <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> passed two bills to formally create both <ORGANIZATION>Student Watch</ORGANIZATION> and Buddies on Call . 
Second-year College student <PERSON>Ben Cosgro</PERSON> , president of <ORGANIZATION>Student Watch</ORGANIZATION> , said the organization will operate mainly around the Corner and respond to students in need of assistance . 
Members will walk around in groups of three and help to ensure the safety of students even they do not directly ask for help . 
Similarly , Buddies on Call will provide assistance to students by offering the service of ' buddies ' to walk students home on weekend nights . 
Law School Representative <PERSON>W. Andrew Lanius</PERSON> , a third-year student , said <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> still needed to have further discussion on the bills given their ambiguities . 
As of the meeting , Student Watch had not yet written a constitution for their organization . 
" Before we just pass something , lets make sure its something that 's been considered and thoughtful , " he said . 
" The issue is that [ the organizations ] are not defined in the bills . " 
Commerce Representative <PERSON>Sarah Olsen</PERSON> , a fourth-year student , expressed concern the bill might not get anywhere if left to be considered until next semester . 
Other members argued this was a special circumstance in which <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> has heard the information in question even if it is not explicitly laid out in each program 's bill for creation . 
Council voted to have a review and endorsement of the by-laws of each organization on their first session next semester in order for these programs to continue . 
Council also voted to have both organizations to report back to the Representative Body after their first functional semesters and at the end of each session of the Representative Body . 
Each organization will share its results , and <ORGANIZATION>Council</ORGANIZATION> members will then vote on the continuation of each program . 
Council President <PERSON>Jalen Ross</PERSON> , a fourth-year Engineering student , said the programs still need to be negotiated into a special status agreement . 
" These will get negotiated into that agreement which will give them full protections under the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's insurance , " he said . 
Council also passed a bill in support of a public comment period at <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> meeting . 
Ibby Han , a second-year College student , said the issue has already been handed to <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors Special Committee on Governance</ORGANIZATION> . 
Members of U.Va . 
Students United will be meeting with the <ORGANIZATION>Board</ORGANIZATION> to discuss the logistics of the comment period . 
Council leaders also met with <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> in a closed meeting to discuss where the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is headed in dealing with the issues of sexual assault and safety .
