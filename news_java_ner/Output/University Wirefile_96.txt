This <DATE>summer</DATE> , <PERSON>Oldham</PERSON> hopes to work two jobs in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> : one with the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> and one with the <ORGANIZATION>Brookings Institute</ORGANIZATION> studying antitrust law in telecommunications .

Eventually , with his dual graduate degree , <PERSON>Oldham</PERSON> wants to work in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to address many issues of social public policy , including sexual assault , education and welfare .
