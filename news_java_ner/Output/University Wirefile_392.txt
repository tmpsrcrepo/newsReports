If you did n't know better , you might think the country was in the midst of a new liberal golden age . 
<LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> are leading the push for legalized marijuana , gay marriage is making its way to <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> and progressives are winning elections by championing women 's rights . 
Such victories are misleading , however , because while they show social liberalism ascending , <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is still very much in the grips of trickle down economics . 
Most of our debates about economic inequality have narrowly focused on tax and spending policies , but in order to truly rebuild a broad middle class we need to revive <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's foundering labor movement . 
Since the <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> era , it 's become commonplace to dismiss unions as anachronisms of an age of robber barons and child labor . 
Unions might have once been needed , we 're told , but they 're irrelevant in the modern world . 
The facts tell an entirely different story . 
Far from producing a net gain or even neutral result , declines in union density have crippled American workers . 
The more unions have declined , the more the share of income going to the highest earners has skyrocketed . 
At the same time , real wages have been mostly flat for the past 30 years and have not increased with gains in productivity . 
Compared to non-union workers , organized workers make an average of <MONEY>$ 200</MONEY> more weekly or about <MONEY>$ 10,000</MONEY> more annually . 
When union density decreases , workers lose out on crucial income gains that can make the difference between poverty and middle class . 
These statistics do not reflect a narrow segment of workers losing the benefits unions once provided them but rather an entire working class that being disadvantaged in their absence . 
While unions certainly secure benefits for their members through collective bargaining , non-union members gain advantages too because non-union employers need to offer more attractive salaries and benefits to incentivize workers to take the jobs they offer . 
While private sector unions help raise the standard of living for all workers , public sector unions also benefit the population as a whole by advocating for robust funding of public services like education and health care . 
Even if they concede that unions may offer some benefits to workers , opponents of unions argue irreversible economic forces caused their decline from <PERCENT>20.1 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1983</DATE> to <PERCENT>11.3 percent</PERCENT> in density by <DATE>2014</DATE> . 
While globalization has certainly played a role in union decline across all industrialized countries , it is instructive to compare the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> to find the root causes of decline . 
Compared to the <ORGANIZATION>United States</ORGANIZATION> ' paltry <PERCENT>11.3 percent</PERCENT> unionization rate , <PERCENT>26.8 percent</PERCENT> of Canadian workers belong to unions , a number that has declined only <PERCENT>1.3 percent</PERCENT> since <DATE>1999</DATE> . 
While <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> is certainly not the same country as the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , they are similar in that they both boast highly diversified economies in which the service and manufacturing sectors are well represented . 
The crucial difference is labor law . 
Under Canadian labor law , a majority of employees need only sign cards expressing their support for being represented by unions , whereas in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> it is a long and onerous process vulnerable to intimidation and anti-union propaganda by employers . 
So-called " right to work " laws , primarily in <LOCATION>Southern</LOCATION> states , also play a large role in containing the growth of unions , because workers can receive the benefits of collective bargaining without actually participating in the union . 
This is what economists call the free rider effect , and it undermines the labor movement financially and politically . 
Globalization will continue the shift from manufacturing to the service industry regardless of these changes , but it is misleading to say that workers can do nothing but stand idly while their representation and job security erode . 
Beyond bread and butter wage and benefits issues , unions also provide a more decent and welcoming workplace . 
Too many vulnerable members of the labor force have no recourse against abusive bosses , failure to receive back pay , or sexual harassment . 
Unions have the explicit goal of protecting the interests of their members , and even if current unions sometimes fall short of their goal , they provide significant peace of mind for people who lack other alternatives . 
Until full employment returns , it 's likely that labor unions will remain under siege . 
The necessary first ingredient of any comeback , however , must be a vibrant public discussion of the harsh realities of workplaces in the Great Recession and how unions can alter that dynamic for the better . 
Unions were crucial in building the middle class in world history and with the right political will can be again .
