Perhaps the hallmark of the first year experience at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> is the shared on-Grounds living experience . 
Dorm living has its perks - namely , camaraderie and support - but also has its downfalls , like long walks to Bodo 's and shared bathrooms . 
For many if not most students , our hallmates are the first people we meet at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> and our first friends . 
In recent weeks , members of the <ORGANIZATION>University Community</ORGANIZATION> have spoken about a need for change , in both policy and cultural , in response to the Rolling Stone article . 
It seems we mostly are in agreement that something must change . 
However , the first step must be identifying what kind of concrete changes we want to see in our community . 
One distinct problem is the separation of first-year students by gender , which establishes a culture in which gender - rather than humanity - is the most important identifying factor for students . 
By integrating halls by gender , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> will create an environment characterized by compassion , understanding , and shared experience rather than characterized by gender divisions . 
Last year , I lived in <LOCATION>Hancock</LOCATION> . 
Living in a hall of girls was fun , and I had the opportunity to make close friends in a comfortable environment . 
However , looking back , I realize living with only girls prevented me from forming close friendships with the opposite sex when I first arrived at school . 
I can not speak for the other 3300 some first years living in other dorms , but from my conversations with other students I can say with some degree of confidence that most dorms had similar unspoken divisions in friendships . 
When walking to O'Hill for dinner , I would often see groups of girls or boys walking , but ca n't remember a time when I saw an integrated group . 
Though I have seen friends form close friendships with the other gender within their dorm , I do n't think this is the average experience . 
Living in the same building as someone is not the same as living next to them , and does not allow you to get to know them as well as you would living with them over the course of an entire year , unless you are involved in some other group together . 
As a result of the isolation of my own hall , I had very little understanding about what it was like to be a man at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , and the unique social pressures men face . 
Likewise , I can assume the men living in my dorm did not know what it was like to be a woman at <ORGANIZATION>the University</ORGANIZATION> , and the challenges we face . 
It is easy to make generalizations when we can not say , " I have a friend who .... " Even if men and women not interacting because of floor divisions was not a common experience at the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> , I would still argue that integrated co-ed floors would be beneficial . 
Friendships are not the only concern here . 
Gender-dominated spaces do not breed a welcoming and inclusive environment . 
For me , visiting an all-male floor felt like visiting an extra-terrestrial body , and I was greeted by surprised looks which made me feel like I was somewhere I fundamentally did n't belong . 
As highlighted by my fellow columnist , <PERSON>George Knaysi</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> also lacks the LGBTQ considerate gender neutral housing option that over 140 universities across the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> have recently introduced . 
Some might claim boys and girls should live on separate floors for privacy or safety reasons . 
I would challenge this claim . 
We are aiming to establish a culture of unequivocal respect in which humanity is more important than any other identifiers . 
It is not presumptuous to assume men and women can live on the same floor and respect each other 's privacy and safety . 
Several other universities have dorms in which people of all gender identities cohabitate without major conflict . 
I am a strong believer in the idea that dialogue and conversation between groups can have very tangible social benefits . 
In my experience as a Sustained Dialogue Moderator , I have frequently heard the phrase , " Wow ! 
I had no idea that was the experience of [ insert category that the student is not in here ] at the University ! " 
This shock results from a lack of interaction between different groups . 
While some criticize dialogue for not always being action-oriented , I think that encountering an opposite viewpoint or experience has immense value in its own right . 
Although these kinds of diverse conversations can occur in other areas of University life , they should be encouraged as soon as we arrive on Grounds . 
Co-ed halls will have more varied perspectives . 
For example , when the entire first year class goes to JPJ to listen to a presentation about sexual assaults , debriefs from that event are held among halls . 
For students to walk away from this presentation truly internalizing its message , it is vital that they hear reactions from students of varied gender-identities . 
A living situation in which gender is the demarcation line between students will not breed the positive cultural changes this community needs . 
Men and women are expected to co-exist and collaborate in all other areas of <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> life . 
This cohesion and respect should start when we first arrive on Grounds .
