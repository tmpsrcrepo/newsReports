Thomas Jefferson's university was founded in 1819 as an auspicious institution,an "academical village" surrounding a building modeled after the Roman Pantheonwith a strict honor code and a deep commitment to traditions and public service.This week? The image linked to Mr. Jefferson's University looks like it's fromway back in our nation's shameful history - a bloodied young African Americanman, thrown to the ground for a picayune alleged offense.That disturbing photo of Martese Johnson, the 20-year-old University of Virginiastudent who got turned away from an Irish pub at the end of St. Patrick's Dayrevels, is another sign that something is seriously wrong in Charlottesville.Murderous love, epic power struggles, gang rapes/not-gang-rapes,kidnapping/killing and now, a bloody arrest for an alcohol infraction? No otheruniversity in the nation is producing more sensation and scandal right now.On Monday, the school was front and center again as the Charlottesville policeannounced that their investigators found no evidence of an alleged fraternitygang-rape  described in Rolling Stone m agazine.The string of events at U-Va. sounds more like the season lineup for the BravoNetwork than news from a highly selective "public Ivy" where all students mustmemorize the code of honor, and many write this pledge on the top of everyassignment and exam: "On my honor, I pledge that I have neither given norreceived help on this assignment."Traditions on "Grounds," as the U-Va. campus is always called, matter a greatdeal - sometimes too much. The university didn't admit an African Americanstudent until 1950 - and that was after a lawsuit. And it was one of the lastpublic universities in the country to allow women to enroll freely. In 1970,again, after legal action.There is something called the "Charlottesville Curse." And I didn't make thatup.It's what the North Carolina Tar Heels called their gridiron losing streakagainst U-Va., in a rivalry that dates back to an 1892 football game (Virginiawon).  But maybe it's time to expand that idea beyond the football field,because one of America's finest and oldest universities is totally bedeviled.But wait, maybe football does have something to do with it. Because the TarHeels declared the curse broken Oct. 16, 2010, when they beat the Cavaliers andbegan their  five-year winning streak.That was not long after U-Va.'s streak of dark and bizarre events got rolling.On May 3, 2010, Virginia lacrosse player Yeardley Love was killed by heron-again, off-again boyfriend George Huguely, also a lacrosse player.After a sensational trial that sent Huguely to prison, the university'sleadership provided the drama. University President Teresa A. Sullivan wasserved her walking papers after getting knifed by the Board of Visitors becauseshe wasn't making the university flashy or cashy enough. Sullivan survived, but,whew, what a furor.This past year has been the worst of all. First, in September, 18-year-oldsophomore Hannah Graham went missing. A month later, her remains were found.Jesse L. Matthew Jr., 33, was arrested, and he was later linked to theinvestigation of another young woman's killing - Morgan Harrington, 20, aVirginia Tech student - who was last seen on U-Va.'s campus in 2009 at aMetallica concert.And then Rolling Stone magazine published the story of "Jackie," a student whosaid she was violently gang-raped at a fraternity party - a story that shockedthe nation and set off a wave of angst at U-Va.The story turned out to be false. But Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longosaid Monday that although there's no evidence to support the gang-rapeallegation, they aren't closing the investigation."It's a disservice to Jackie," Longo told reporters at yet another televisednews conference about U-Va. He noted that there is no statute of limitations forsexual assault. And he said that just because the Rolling Stone article'sversion of events is false, "that doesn't mean something terrible didn't happento Jackie that night."On top of all that? The Cavaliers were knocked out of the basketball playoffsthis weekend, and The Post's front page Monday had a most appropriate metaphorfor the state of Mr. Jefferson's University: a photo of U-Va. players hangingtheir heads low.It's time for U-Va. to break the curse plaguing it. Not by clinging totraditions that exclude or waxing nostalgic for the days when the university wasall-white and all-male.But rather, the university will flourish if it holds to its founding principles:honor, academic rigor, respect and integrity.You know, the stuff you don't see on Bravo.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that theuniversity has an iconic building modeled after the Parthenon.petula.dvorak@washpost.comTwitter: @petulad√Ø...OE                 To read previous columns, go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak.
