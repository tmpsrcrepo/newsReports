Candidate: President BushImages: Young girl pouring milk in a kitchen; John Kerry speaking; a girlplaying on a suburban porch; another boarding a school bus.Time: 30 secondsAudio: When it comes to issues that affect our families, are John Kerry'spriorities the same as yours? Kerry voted against parental notification forteenage abortions. Kerry even voted to allow schools to hand out the"morning-after" pill without parents' knowledge. He voted to take control awayfrom parents by taking away their right to know. John Kerry has his priorities.The question is, are they yours?Analysis: This ad, with a female narrator, continues the president's "values"assault against Kerry and tries to frame the abortion issue in a way that makeshim appear insensitive to parents.Kerry in 1991 voted against a Republican amendment to force clinics to notifyparents when a minor seeks an abortion. But he voted for a Democratic amendmentto allow adults other than the parents to determine whether a girl was matureenough to decide on her own. Kerry says he, like the American MedicalAssociation, opposes mandatory notification because it could put some girls atrisk of abuse, family violence, late-term abortions or unwanted childbirth, andthat his approach allows judicial exceptions with the consent of other relativesand the girl's doctor .In 2000, Kerry voted to kill an amendment barring federal funds for thedistribution of the "morning-after" contraceptive pill on school grounds. Kerrysays schools should be able to provide such contraception to girls who arevictims of rape or incest or not covered by insurance.In both cases, the votes cited are accurate, but Kerry's explanations, howeverwell argued, are complicated.The Bush camp also released a radio ad, airing on African American stations inseven cities from Philadelphia to Cleveland, that repeats these charges andrecycles others in attacking Kerry's "extreme voting record." The spot follows aKerry television ad targeted at black voters, but Bush strategists say thatunlike the senator they are not tailoring separate messages for differentgroups.--  Howard KurtzVideo of this ad can be found at www.washingtonpost.com/politics.
