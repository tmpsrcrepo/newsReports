Considering what a provocative figure Errol Flynn was, "The Last of Robin Hood"sure is dull. Even the subversive tale of Flynn's final love affair - with a15-year-old girl in the late 1950s - isn't enough to enliven the drama byco-writers and co-directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland.At least the casting is great. A mustachioed Kevin Kline - with a dandifiedaccent and a habit of pantomimed swashbuckling - is a ringer for the 48-year-oldFlynn, and Susan Sarandon transforms herself for the role of a deranged stagemother. She plays Florence Aadland, who has transferred her dreams of fame ontoher daughter, Beverly (Dakota Fanning), an ethereal girl with middling talentwho catches Flynn's eye as she's heading to her job as a chorus girl on aHollywood movie set.The moment is nicely shot, showing Beverly's reflection in a window as shebounces down the street in her youthful way. A quick shift of focus shows thatwe're not the only ones watching Beverly; Flynn is on the other side of thewindow, peering through the blinds.She's seduced by Flynn that evening during an "audition" at his house and isultimately charmed into becoming his girlfriend. Her mother naively believesthat Beverly is merely Flynn's protégée, but even when Florence finds out thetrue nature of the pair's relationship, she doesn't really discourage theaffair. Although Flynn is basically washed up, Florence thinks he could be thefamily's savior.In his defense, I suppose, Flynn believes Beverly is 18 when they first meet.That's still three decades his junior, but at least it's legal. And yet, true tohis reputation as an insatiable lothario, uncovering her true age does not deterhim. In one of the film's few funny moments, Beverly's father calls the actor "awalking penis."The movie briefly delves into a couple of charges of statutory rape lodgedagainst the former Robin Hood in the early 1940s. (He was acquitted.) Even ifBeverly had been aware of those charges, she might not have cared. She falls forFlynn, and in the process she becomes a pawn for both her mother and her lover.She makes the prematurely aged, vodka-pickled actor feel young and importantwhile keeping alive Florence's hopes of stardom for her daughter.Beverly is a tragic figure, and Flynn and Florence aren't the only ones whoobjectify her; Glatzer and Westmoreland do as well, painting her as a hollowcharacter with no discernible personality. She mostly sits around lookingwide-eyed. The fact that Flynn doesn't really think of her as a person is badenough - he calls her Woodsy, short for "wood nymph," after deeming her an"exquisite creature." That the filmmakers don't bother to give her character anycomplexity only adds to the ick factor.Ultimately the movie feels like an empty exercise. Sure, it's a cautionary taleabout the pitfalls of fame. But when the one figure most worthy of our sympathyis nothing more than a beautiful blonde robot, what's the point?stephanie.merry@washpost.comÂ½R. At area theaters.
