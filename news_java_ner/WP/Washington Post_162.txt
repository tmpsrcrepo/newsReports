President Obama toured the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota onFriday, marking his first visit to Indian country since his 2008 campaign - andhis first since signing two bills into law that were in large part aimed atbetter protecting Native American women from violent crimes on tribal lands.Both laws - the Tribal Law and Order Act, signed in 2010, and the ViolenceAgainst Women Act (VAWA), which passed Congress and was signed into law lastyear - give tribal justice systems more power in prosecuting and sentencingviolent offenders on reservations, where gaps in the federal law had made NativeAmerican communities havens for criminals for decades. The reason: Tribalprosecutors were barred from prosecuting crimes by non-Native Americanoffenders.Tribal leaders, citing statistics that show one in three Native American womenare assaulted or raped in their lifetimes and three in five are victims ofdomestic violence, backed the Obama administration's push for both laws. Formany, the fact that most victims reported their attackers were not NativeAmerican made the push especially urgent.At an annual powwow in Cannon Ball, a small community that straddles NorthDakota and South Dakota, Obama on Friday noted work in enhancing tribal courts'authority, saying his administration had made more progress in closing justicegaps than any other in history - "particularly when it comes to criminalsentencing and prosecuting people who commit violence against women.""Let's put our minds together to advance justice because, like every American,you deserve to live safely in your communities," he said.Even with the new laws, however,  the wait for justice for native womencontinues, in part because VAWA won't take effect until next year on mostreservations, including the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Tribes also arerequired to have implemented a series of steps, some of which could pose largelegal costs.One, for example, includes ensuring that tribal judges have appropriatecredentials they might not already have, said Troy Eid, a former U.S. attorneyfor Colorado who this past year chaired the Justice Department's Indian Law andOrder Commission."It's going to be a while before these changes take place on many reservations,"he said. "And there is going to be a lot of waiting while these issues unfold."One of those waiting is Willetta Dolphus, who runs a women's shelter, the PrettyBird Woman House, on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. She says she isn'tsure when the women she serves will even see the effects of the VAWA'sprotections. She also notes that the perceived threat of violence is rising inher area, where the region's energy boom has brought an influx of oil workersand man camps to the plains of the Dakotas."We're anxiously waiting and just wish it didn't take so long," Dolphus said."But we're glad there's work in place, also. We got some hope anyway."Beyond the wait for the law's start date, there are other hurdles for nearly allthe 566 federally recognized tribes."What VAWA covers and what tribes can execute in terms of their statutes isreally, really narrow," Eid said.VAWA, for example, requires that a victim and her assailant know each other,beyond a first encounter, and a tribal prosecutor must be able to prove thisbeyond a reasonable doubt, Eid said.Also, some 200 Alaska Native tribes and villages were excluded from the lawbecause of political opposition within the state and on an apparent technicality- the term "Indian country" used in the language of VAWA is not a legal termthat applies to all Alaska Native lands.Juana Majel-Dixon, who holds a traditional appointment on the Pauma Band ofLuiseÃ±o Indians legislative council and leads the National Congress of AmericanIndians task force on addressing violence against women, is especially concernedabout Alaska."The exclusion of Alaska villages from the definition of Indian country putsthem at a great disadvantage with their public safety, and especially for womenand children," she said. "[VAWA] has to be amended."The findings of the Justice Department commission, chaired by Eid, agreed thatthe state's native villages, many of which are only reachable by plane and facesome of the most dire law enforcement disparities in the country, should havethe expanded legal authority under VAWA. Crime rates are 10 times higher thanthe rest of the country, the commission said in a report released in November.According to the Indian Law and Order Commission's report, at least 75communities do not have any law enforcement presence, and there is just onewomen's shelter among all of the villages, which lie hundreds of miles apart insome cases. Alaska Native women make up less than 20 percent of the state'spopulation but nearly half of the reported rape victims.Getting Alaska included in the law is a priority this year for the NationalCongress of American Indians, Majel-Dixon said. Its membership of triballeadership and advocates met in Anchorage last week."We're pushing a national platform that highlights the needs of Alaska Nativewomen," Majel-Dixon added. "We're saying it's on."Excerpted from washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people.
