The defense team for baseball legend Roger Clemens wrapped up its case Mondaywithout calling the star pitcher to the stand. His attorneys in the perjurytrial had called nearly two dozen witnesses, including his wife and the wife ofhis chief accuserhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/clemenstrial.Before resting their case, defense attorneys elicited testimony from a formerhead of the New York Yankees security detail who said that accuser - Clemens'sformer strength coach Brian McNamee - has "zero" credibility and should not betrusted.Whether jurors believe McNamee is critical to federal prosecutors. He is theonly witness to offer firsthand knowledge of the baseball legend's alleged useof performance-enhancing drugs during a trial that has already lasted twomonths.Clemens is charged with perjury, making false statements and obstruction ofCongress for denying during a 2008 House hearing that he ever used steroids orhuman growth hormone.Clemens's final witness, former security chief Jerry Laveroni, describedfriction in the clubhouse between McNamee and the team's head athletic trainer.But he was not allowed to testify in detail about the basis for his mistrust ofMcNamee, including the coach's admitted lies to law enforcement officialsinvestigating an alleged sexual assault in Florida.The pitcher's defense team called a series of witnesses to try to contradictsome of the allegations against Clemens. The ballplayer is accused of misleadingCongressional investigators, for instance, when he said that pre-filled needlesof liquid vitamin B-12 arrayed for players after games. But Clemens's formerToronto Blue Jays teammate, catcher Charlie O'Brien, recalled seeing shots ofthe liquid vitamin "lined up ready to go."Clemens's wife, Debbie, also backed up her husband's assertion that he was notpresent at their home when McNamee injected her with human growth hormone. Buton cross-examination, Debbie Clemens conceded last week that she did not have totell her husband what HGH was when she eventually informed him of the injection.That testimony could be problematic for the pitcher, who told Congressionalinvestigators that he "didn't know the first thing about" HGH.With jurors out of the courtroom Monday, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton askedClemens directly whether he had opted not to testify."You've discussed this with your lawyers?" Walton asked."Yes, judge, I sure have," said Clemens.Prosecutors had a chance Monday to rebut Clemens's witnesses before both sidesmake their closing arguments Tuesday. Last week, McNamee's estranged wifecontradicted her husband's assertion that he was saving needles and othermedical waste from injections he allegedly gave Clemens to appease her. EileenMcNamee testified that she did not know the strength coach was injecting bigleague ballplayers with performance-enhancing drugs until 2007.But FBI agent John Longmire testified Monday that Eileen McNamee said in aninterview that the strength coach told her early on that he was saving itemsfrom ballplayers in a FedEx box "just in case." Clemens's DNA and steroids werefound on a needle in the box.Clemens was joined in the courtroom Monday by two of his four sons and his wife,who was allowed to observe the trial for the first time after testifying lastweek.marimowa@washpost.comwilberd@washpost.com
