Shortly after President Obama announced plans Wednesday to form a task forcetargeting sexual assaults on college campuses, Dana Bolger's cellphone rang.It was Tina Tchen, first lady Michelle Obama's chief of staff and executivedirector of the White House Council on Women and Girls, calling to congratulateBolger and thank her for her work. Tchen's words echoed the president's, whichdid not directly address Bolger but spoke to her experience."We need to keep saying to anyone out there who has ever been assaulted, 'Youare not alone. You will never be alone,'Ã¢[#x20ac][#x2c6]" Obama said during thenews conference where he signed the memorandum launching the initiative to presscolleges and universities to take steps to prevent sexual assaults and improvethe way they respond to such attacks.A White House report released at the news conference included a statistic thatBolger and many of her friends have already lived: One in five women is sexuallyassaulted at college."When I think back to where I was two years ago, when I'd left college afterbeing raped and stalked, I could have never imagined what I'd be seeing todayand what I'd be a part of," Bolger said after her brief phone conversation withTchen. "I don't quite have the words to describe it."In 2012, when Bolger created It Happens Here, an online forum for AmherstCollege survivors of rape, her activism spread far beyond the centralMassachusetts campus. Soon other harrowing stories started pouring in: Studentsfrom private schools such as Wesleyan University in Connecticut, public schoolssuch as the University of North Carolina, and many other institutions said thatwhen they reported their accounts of sexual assaults, school administratorsseemed more concerned with the image of the school than investigating thecomplaints and offering assistance.During the spring of 2013, Bolger partnered with a Yale student activist,Alexandra Brodsky, to co-found Know Your IX, an organization that educatesstudents about their rights and protections against sexual harassment and sexualviolence under the federal Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The lawprohibits discrimination on the basis of sex at educational institutions thatreceive federal money.Reaching out to schools nationwide, Know Your IX launched a campaign to mobilizestudents who felt discouraged by sexual-assault policies to file Title IXcomplaints. According to the Department of Education, 95 percent of the office'srecord-breaking 9,950 civil rights cases in 2013 - 30 of them directly regardingTitle IX and sexual assault - were resolved within 180 days of receipt."Institutions of higher education have had a perverse incentive to suppressknowledge of sexual assault on campus and to mishandle them," said Lisa Wade, anassociate professor of sociology at Occidental College. "When the majority ofschools are silent, any given school is seen as a unique source of sexualviolence, which isn't true."After Bolger and her classmates went public with their stories in 2012, AmherstPresident Carolyn Martin swiftly hired a consultant to review and revise thecollege's sexual-assault policies. But not all schools have been as quick torespond.It took four years for Tufts University, 90 miles east of Amherst, to overhaulits sexual-assault policy into what is now a 17-page document.To former Tufts student Wagatwe Sara Wanjuki, 27, who began organizing at Tuftsa year after she filed a complaint of rape in 2008, an effective policy requiresthe school administration's vigilance even after significant changes."I know a current student who had a less-than-ideal situation with the policylast year, and the same administrators are still there. It's one thing to havean effective policy on paper but it needs to be practiced," Wanjuki said.In the years following Wanjuki's and Bolger's assaults, more cases surfaced atcolleges and high schools. The obvious inconsistencies in school policiesemphasized administrators' uncertainty over how to treat such cases. In its memoWednesday, the White House called colleges' compliance with federal law "uneven,and in too many cases, inadequate."In cases of campus domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault andstalking, federal law stipulates that schools must provide clear sexual-assaultpolicies and ongoing resources for students. These mandates are part of theCampus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, which in January 2013 updated a statuterequiring federally funded schools to disclose incidents of crime to theDepartment of Education.After the attention surrounding several high-profile rape allegations, includingincidents at Florida State University and in Steubenville, Ohio, Obama's supporton the issue was a delight to Bolger, whose organization may have played anindirect hand in crafting the policy."We were thrilled to see that the first five objectives for Obama's new taskforce were identical to our demands last summer," Bolger said.The move was not surprising to Angela Hattery, a women and gender studiesprofessor at George Mason University, who said that the president and hisadministration have shown more sensitivity to women's issues."Practically speaking, [the president has] daughters going to college soon,"Hattery said. "Not to say men can't be victims as well, but that's when it hitsclose to home for them. When the issue is more personalized, that's whenawareness is heightened."In his remarks Wednesday, Obama called on men to take responsibility forreducing sexual violence."We've got to keep teaching young men in particular to show women the respectthey deserve and to recognize sexual violence and be outraged by it and to dotheir part to stop it from happening in the first place," the president said."I want every young man in America to feel some strong peer pressure in terms ofhow they are supposed to behave and treat women," he said. "And that startsbefore they get to college."The president also made the task force the subject of his weekly address. Thetask force will include the attorney general, secretary of education and otherCabinet members and agency heads. It will have 90 days to developrecommendations for curbing and responding to campus sexual assaults. The grouphas one year to report back to the president on its progress toward implementingits recommendations.Bolger hopes the task force will listen to groups such as those founded by herand other survivors."We're the ones on the ground, the ones who have experienced violence from ourclassmates and betrayal from our schools, who have spent countless hourslearning the law and talking to advocates," Bolger said. "We need to be at thetable making decisions that will affect our lives."Ruth Tam is a contributor to She The People. For other columns, go towashingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people.
