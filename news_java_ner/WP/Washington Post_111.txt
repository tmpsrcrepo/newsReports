Name: John ButlerPosition: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) fellow and groupleader, Applied Genetics Group, Biomolecular Measurement DivisionBest known for: Improving DNA technology to help solve crimes. TV shows such as"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" and "NCIS" may make DNA forensic testing appearrelatively easy, but scientists such as Butler are truly advancing thetechnology for crime-solving. A leading expert on forensic DNA technology,Butler developed a system to improve how scientists perform forensic analysis ondegraded DNA samples - a process used on remains from the World Trade Centerattacks, on fallen soldiers and in decades-old criminal cases.He's now testing the reliability of new technology to speed up DNA analysis fromeight hours to one and refining the testing to make it more precise. He is alsoinvolved in research to isolate the male Y chromosome from DNA samples, makingit easier to identify those who have committed sexual assaults. In addition tocrime-solving, DNA technology is used to resolve paternity issues, identifydisaster victims and assist in missing-person cases. Butler has written fourbooks on DNA testing, including one textbook, "Forensic DNA Typing," which manyforensic DNA analysts consider to be the field's bible.Government work: After working at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, duringgraduate school, Butler conducted his postdoctoral work at NIST, spent two yearsat a private company and returned to NIST in 1999 to lead the agency's effortsin human identity testing.Motivation for service: Butler sees his work as an important public servicebecause it helps forensic laboratories do their jobs more effectively andassists the criminal justice process. "NIST is a place where I can have animpact and help society," he said.Biggest challenge: Finding enough time to conduct research and write whileresponding to requests that range from helping the FBI with data analysis toassisting domestic and foreign forensic laboratories improve their processes.Quote: "We are helping solve crimes.
