Ferrell and Hart earneasy laughs, but some jokes miss the point"Get Hard" opens with a tight close-up of Will Ferrell weeping - openly,copiously, theatrically - in what has become his signature gesture of doingsomething banal to an absurd extreme. In this scattershot, funny-dumb satire,Ferrell plays James, a Los Angeles financier whose arrest for fraud interruptshis life as a one-percenter. He enlists the help of Darnell (Kevin Hart), theguy who washes his car, to help him prepare for prison, assuming that, if it'strue that one in three black men will end up behind bars, it's statisticallylikely that a menial laborer will have done time at some point.In fact, Darnell owns the carwashing company, is a devoted husband and father,and aspires to move his family into a better school district. But in exchangefor the down payment on a house, he's willing, as he explains to his wife, to"be every stereotype [James] thinks I am." The result is a fish-out-of-waterbuddy comedy that - when it's working - also does a smartly scathing job ofsending up privilege, entitlement and crony capitalism: the whole phenomenon, asit's been said, of being born on third base and thinking you've hit a triple.Or, as James's weaselly boss, played by Craig T. Nelson, puts it, starting withnothing: "just me, my computer and an $8 million loan from my father."Written by Jay Martel, Ian Roberts, Etan Cohen and Adam McKay, "Get Hard"punctuates those ironic zingers with broader, more low-brow physical set pieces,most of which pivot around Hart's diminutive height and James's fear of beingraped in prison.The dubious merit of tiresome "don't drop the soap" jokes aside, "Get Hard"sometimes veers perilously close to committing the very sins it aspires tocriticize. The movie is drenched in gay panic. (One of those set pieces takesplace in the bathroom of a West Hollywood restaurant where James forces himselfto practice the sexual technique he so fears he'll have to get used to.) And,when the two men enlist the services of Darnell's street-toughened cousin, someof those stereotypes Darnell invoked earlier - from gangbangers to twerkinghoochie mamas - come floridly and lazily into play.Still, Ferrell and Hart have a genial, easygoing chemistry and "Get Hard"manages to score more than a few good points about facile assumptions and toxichypocrisy. In a patronizing but on-point wish-fulfillment sequence, James helpsDarnell's cousin to monetize his ill-gotten gains by way of complex computertrading programs, resulting in exponential growth of his portfolio. "The stockmarket is  gangsta ," one of his minions exclaims. Elizabeth Warren couldn'thave put it better.ann.hornaday@washpost.comR.  At area theaters.
