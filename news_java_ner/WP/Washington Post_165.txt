Faith in our justice system is scant in some communities - often the ones withthe most direct experience with police, prosecutors and judges.Like in Curly's Barbering Services, a little shop in a Prince George's Countystrip mall always packed with customers who talk long and loud way after theirhair is done.Curly, also known as Thomas Jefferson Brown, 46, has a soft spot forex-offenders. A lot of his barbers are guys he's giving a second chance aftertime behind bars.In Curly's world, there's nothing surprising about the Justice Department andthe FBI acknowledging that nearly every examiner in an elite forensic unit gaveflawed testimony against criminal defendants for more than 20 years."Well, yeah, they were lying," one man said when I asked what they made of thenews, which calls into question the work of the FBI Laboratory's microscopichair comparison unit before 2000.Of 28 examiners, the FBI says 26 of them gave flawed testimony in favor ofprosecutors, The Washington Post's Spencer Hsu wrote. The hundreds of casesbeing revisited by the government include 32 that ended with death rowconvictions.The forensic scandal gives real teeth to the long-ignored complaints we hearfrom the over-prisoned pockets of the country, where generations of people arelocked up in the nation with the highest incarceration rate in the world.Make all the jokes you want about everyone in jail saying they're innocent.Yeah, yeah, they're all angels in there. And there's no doubt that plenty offolks on the inside are guilty of all kinds of crimes.But there is growing evidence that wrongful convictions are more common thanmany people think. Since 1989, we've had exonerations in 329 cases based on DNAevidence, entire lifetimes lost because of mistakes bolstered by bias.Every year we hear stories about these innocent people, trapped in the ambertime suck of prison, trying to reintegrate into a world that has changed atlight speed and left them behind once they are set free.Hundreds of human years lost - damage that simply cannot be repaired.Imagine being Kirk Odom, who served 22 years in prison and another nine onparole as a registered sex offender after being wrongly convicted of raping awoman on Capitol Hill because of flawed forensic hair analysis.Or Santae Tribble, who did 23 years for a D.C. cabdriver's murder he did notcommit  because of a bad informant and an FBI analyst who presented bogus hairanalysis.Or the unforgettable case of Thomas Haynesworth, who spent a breathtaking 27years in prison for rapes he didn't commit.The country has been grappling with the fallout of Michael Brown's shooting inFerguson, Mo., and Eric Garner's death after being held in a police chokehold inNew York. This month we all watched the video of Walter Scott's apparentexecution by a police officer in Charleston, S.C.These biases, these incidents are real. Which brings me back to Curly, who I meta few years ago when I was chasing down one of these ex-offenders working forhim who was trying to build his life back up.While I was hanging out in Curly's shop, I struck up a conversation with a guynamed Maurice Sykes. He began to tell me his story, how he was one of these guysexonerated in a case and was trying to get back on his feet after 11 years inprison.He'd been convicted in the 1995 homicide of a Bulgarian diplomat's son outsidethe Bulgarian Embassy in Northwest Washington. Sykes spent more than a decadetrying to tell people he was innocent, that he was out of town burying arelative the night of that murder. In 2006, a three-judge panel ruled that theprosecutors had screwed up evidence that could have proven Sykes's innocence -and overturned his conviction.Sykes was out, but he was depressed, humiliated and having a hard time adjustingto a world that had changed so dramatically.His case didn't hinge on flawed hair matches, but it is still an egregiousexample of the way justice can be miscarried and the huge, incalculable humantoll these mistakes take.On Monday, I asked Curly how Sykes is doing. Okay, he said, but he still hasn'trecovered - and neither have others Curly believes were innocent, too."It's sad that this is the system," said the barber, in a place where faith injustice can be thin.petula.dvorak@washpost.comTwitter: @petulad√Ø...OETo read previous columns, go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak.
