Tavon White's loyal women brought him anything he wanted - drugs, money, thelatest cellphones, tobacco and food, federal prosecutors say. They even boughthim luxury German cars.In the past four years, four of these women allegedly gave him five children.One tattooed "Tavon" on her neck; another has "Tavon" on her wrist.White was an inmate in the Baltimore City Detention Center. The harem? His jailguards, according to an indictment.Thirteen female corrections officers essentially handed control of the jail overto White and other members of the Black Guerilla Family, prosecutors say,allowing gang members to sell drugs and other contraband from behind bars. Thejaw-dropping allegations left plenty of people wondering: Do women have anybusiness being guards in a men's jail?Here's something you might not know. In Baltimore's jails, which are run by thestate, more than 60 percent of the guards are women, Maryland correctionsofficials estimate. And nationwide, their numbers are rapidly approaching paritywith male guards. Women made up about 37 percent of the corrections force in2007, according to the American Correctional Association.It makes sense. Our incarceration rate has skyrocketed over the past 25 years,and most of those caught up in the criminal justice system are men. Fewer menthan ever can pass the background check to become corrections officers. Womenhave filled the gap, applying in droves for stressful but stable jobs that payan average of $40,000 a year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.Now get ready for my next bombshell. According to a frequently quoted report bythe Justice Department on sex in prisons and jails, most of the guards havingsex with their charges are women. "Among the 39,121 male prison inmates who hadbeen victims of staff sexual misconduct, 69% reported sexual activity withfemale staff," according to the 2008-09 Bureau of Justice Statistics study.It's even higher in juvenile detention facilities, where 90 percent of the boyswho said they were victims of sexual advances by officers said they wereapproached - and frequently raped - by women.Sometimes we can make our pedestals a little too high. When women assumepositions of power over the lives of others, they can become predators just likemen can."There's an assumption that women won't do this, can't do this, that it's not inour nature," said Brenda Smith, a law professor at American University who haswritten extensively about sexual assault in jails and prisons. "But it is in ournature."What about the female guards who are targeted by cunning and charismaticinmates? The women who are loveless, lonely and easily seduced? Are theypredators or the prey?In Montana, jailhouse lothario Michael Murphy seduced at least five femaleprison guards a few years ago. He was known for staging pornlike scenarios.In February, two female corrections officers in New York were arrested aftergetting pregnant by inmates. One of them,                 Nancy Gonzalez, was having sex with Ronell Wilson, who is on death row for killing two policeofficers."I took a chance because I was so vulnerable and wanted to be loved, and now Iam carrying his child," Gonzalez was recorded saying.Lt. Col. Kim Spadaro, president of the American Jail Association, has seen hershare of corrupted correctional officers, both male and female."In general, when the men do these things, the men do it to make the money,"said Spadaro, who is the head of the Broward County (Fla.) Department ofDetention, where about 34 percent of the officers are female. "The women do itbecause they've fallen in love."There was surely some of that in this Baltimore case. According to theindictment, investigators found an operating manual of sorts used by BGF thatdetailed "how new BGF recruits are taught to target a specific stereotype of aCO [correctional officer], specifically women with low self-esteem, insecuritiesand certain physical attributes."Once seduced, the women saw themselves as the wives and girlfriends of White andhis associates.In a jail like Baltimore's, where local convicts are guarded by local officers,there's a toxic social dynamic, Smith reminded me. On the outside, in thesecommunities where women far outnumber men, the men have all the cards, she said.But when the men are locked up and women have the keys, the scenario is flipped.Seduction may be about power, Smith said. A woman can have any man she wants.And he's usually begging for her attention.Remember Abu Ghraib and Army Pfc. Lynndie R. England             , who was a21-year-old reservist when pictures surfaced of her holding a leash tied to theneck of a naked Iraqi prisoner?What was missing there is the same thing that has been missing at the BaltimoreCity Detention Center: oversight.Female guards aren't really the problem; incompetent bosses are. If womenweren't there, White and BGF might have been trying to figure out a way to usemoney and power to corrupt male guards.As long as there has been work, there have been men who have screwed it up.Dirty cops, corrupt bankers, shady businessmen, filthy politicians, molestingdentists. At no point do we say, "Men don't belong in this field."Quite simply, corrupt people don't belong in this field. And these female guardsneed to get booted as far and as hard as any man would.dvorakp@washpost.comTwitter: @petuladTo read previous columns, go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak.
