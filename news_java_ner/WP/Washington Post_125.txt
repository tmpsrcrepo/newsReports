How does a federal worker keep his or her agency out of the news? One sure-fireway is to simply not do anything newsworthy.Too late on that front for Karen Kraushaar, the spokeswoman for the TreasuryDepartment's inspector general, who accused  http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/herman-cain-addresses-sharon-bialeks-charges-as-he-meets-the-press-in-arizona-on-tuesday/2011/11/08/gIQATeB01M_story.html?hpid=z1-URL-Herman Cain  ofsexual harassment when both of them were working at thehttp://www.restaurant.org/-URL-National Restaurant Association .So when Kraushaar was the keynote speaker at ahttp://www.nagconline.org/documents/NAGC2012Program.pdf-URL-conference forfederal communications officials  on Friday, where she delivered a talk titled"Keeping Your Agency Out of the Story: Telling a Story No One Wants Told (butEveryone Wants to Hear)," her strategy was simpler: just keep it off the record.Even though the rest of the conference, held by thehttp://www.nagconline.org-URL-National Association for Government Communicators, was open to the news media (though the rest of the panels and talks soundedway less interesting), we were informed when we showed up that Kraushaar'sremarks would be strictly not-for-publication.Too bad, since we would have loved to hear the promised "lessons [Kraushaar] andher staff learned when a private story suddenly became public." Kraushaarfamously took a turn in the spotlight last year whenhttp://www.thedaily.com/page/2011/11/08/110811-news-cain-accuser-1-3/-URL-theDaily revealed  that she had accused Cain, then a candidate for the Republicanpresidential nomination, of sexual harassment in the 1990s. Once her name wasrevealed,  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/karen-kraushaar-now-wants-to-go-public-with-other-women-with-allegations-against-herman-cain/2011/11/08/gIQA8cZW2M_blog.html-URL-shetold The Washington Post  she wanted to hold a news conference with severalother women who had made similar claims against Cain.Which, presumably would have been on the record. Anyway, the rest of the storyis well known: Cain eventually dropped out of the race in the face of themounting accusations.We caught up with Kraushaar before she talked on Friday, and she told us thather remarks were for the audience of federal workers only.Husbandry and suchIn Washington, jobs on Capitol Hill can require credentials beyond thosedirectly related to the work itself.Take this recent want ad from the office ofhttp://steveking.house.gov/-URL-Rep. Steve King  (R-Iowa), who's looking for an"Agriculture Legislative Assistant.""Qualified candidates will be committed, pro-life conservatives with strongwriting skills," the job posting begins, and "a firm understanding ofagriculture issues and policy, and substantive experience working inagriculture."While not as important as being a committed pro-life conservative, the ad notesthat "Iowa ties are a plus."So send a rsum and cover letter if you're interested. The job is still open, wewere told Monday.It's just another wordWhen http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-federal-panels-vote-on-turkey-and-religious-freedom-four-tops-five/2012/03/27/gIQAdQy7eS_story.html-URL- last we checked  in with thehttp://www.uscirf.gov/-URL-U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom ,it had miraculously figured out how four votes is greater than five. Now thecommission is being sued in federal court for discriminating against Muslims,our colleague Michelle Boorstein reports.http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/under-god/post/federal-lawsuit-charges-religious-freedom-commission-with-discriminating-against-muslims/2012/06/08/gJQAs62NOV_blog.html-URL-The lawsuitalleges the nine-member commission reneged on hiring a Muslim lawyer in 2009once it learned of her faith and her work advocating for American Muslims. (Noneof the current members were on the commission at the time.)The lawsuit says USCIRF staff encouraged Safiya Ghori-Ahmad, who worked brieflyat the commission, to call in sick on the days that particular commissionerswere in the office, to "downplay her religious affiliation" and to emphasizethat she is a "mainstream and 'moderate' Muslim" who doesn't cover her hair.Aponte againIt seems the long-stalled nomination of  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/post/aponte-nomination-its-all-about-rubio/2011/12/15/gIQA72HjwO_blog.html-URL-Mari Carmen Aponte  as ambassador to El Salvador could bemoving again.We hear Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid might schedule a vote as early asthis week. Aponte's nomination fell through the last time the Senate voted on itlate last year, when supporters didn't have enough votes to overcome aRepublican filibuster.Another go at the nomination could throw Sen. Marco Rubio back into thespotlight. The Florida Republican initially voted against breaking thefilibuster - but later agreed to back Aponte and to round up the GOP votesneeded to clear her nomination. Talks between Rubio and Democrats ended inhttp://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_politics/2011/12/sniping-continues-over-rubio-aponte-effort-reids-office-dismisses-rubios-last-minute-as-too-little-too-late-ploy.html-URL-bitter recriminations  but no vote.We hear that Rubio is expected to vote for Aponte this time, but he won't bewhipping votes among colleagues again.Two questions: Will the second time be the charm?
