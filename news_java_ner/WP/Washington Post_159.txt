The headline read: "Ex-Marine convicted in abduction, rape." The first paragraphsaid: "A former U.S. Marine was convicted Friday of abducting and raping aUniversity of Maryland graduate student whom he then left for dead in asecluded, wooded area on a cold February morning."The Oct. 16 Metro section story was small, but it caused a big problem for Postreader Ronald C. Semone."Nowhere in the eight paragraphs of the story could I find any explanation as towhy it was necessary or helpful to identify him as an 'ex-Marine.' I am sure hehad many other past affiliations that could have been used to identify him,"wrote Semone, a District resident. "Any one of those would have been just asrelevant to the crime of which he was convicted."Previous Post stories had noted that the convicted man was living at a MarineCorps facility near the Pentagon when the crime was committed. He was dischargedfrom the Marines after his arrest. But those facts were missing in the shortOct. 16 story, leaving Semone to ask, "Why focus on his military service?"Descriptors like "ex-Marine" can give readers a helpful depiction of people inthe news. But these shorthand labels and phrases, routinely used to describeeverything from ideology to physical appearance, prompt a steady stream ofcomplaints to the ombudsman when readers think they are inaccurate, misleadingor unnecessary.In recent months, The Post has several times referred to people withdisabilities as "wheelchair-bound." Each sparked loud criticism. "Wheelchairsare tools that people use to get around," wrote one reader. "Would you describesomeone who drives as 'confined to her car' or 'SUV-bound'?"There were objections last year when a news brief reported the guilty plea of aCalvert County woman accused of killing two of her "adopted daughters." Seeingno relevance, angry readers accused The Post of stigmatizing adoption.The Post's stylebook says "illegal immigrant" and "undocumented immigrant" maybe used interchangeably to describe those living in the United States withoutlegal approval. Both terms have been used in recent Post stories about IngmarGuandique, on trial for the 2001 murder of federal intern Chandra Levy. But somereaders have contacted me, wondering whether The Post knows that even immigrantswith documents can be here illegally if they arrived using a valid visa butremained after it expired. (In the case of Guandique, The Post has been accuratein describing him as both "illegal" and "undocumented" because he entered theUnited States without a visa.)Ideological labels - conservative, liberal, moderate, progressive - areubiquitous and sometimes inaccurate. For example, The Post has variouslyreferred to the Cato Institute as "libertarian" or "conservative." There's adifference."Libertarian is the term we prefer," said Chris Kennedy, Cato's director ofmedia relations. "This is especially a problem because media types like theirthink tanks to be nice and pigeonholed ideologically. But we are certainly notacross-the-board conservative. We are liberal on a lot of issues." As examples,he said, Cato favors sharp cuts to the military and drug decriminalization.A check of hundreds of Post news stories in recent years shows that they rarelyinclude labels like "left-wing" or "arch conservative," often consideredpejorative."But a lot of times what you'll see is not 'far left' or 'far right.' Instead,you'll see one person described this way and the other not. So, it's the absenceof labels," said Dan Gainor of the Media Research Center, a self-describedconservative group that seeks to expose what it believes is liberal bias in thenational news media.The Post's stylebook offers valuable guidance on avoiding prejudicial orinaccurate descriptors. Labels like "hard-drinking" Irishman or "tempestuous"Latin are forbidden because they unfairly stereotype. Likewise, "fiery redhead"or "diminutive grandmother" should not be used in describing physicalappearance.But the stylebook is not always followed, such as when The Post occasionally hasused "adopted" where it wasn't pertinent. "Adoptive parents and adopted childrenare offended when an unnecessary distinction is drawn between them and otherfamilies," the stylebook notes. And, it says, stories should say someone "uses"a wheelchair; they are not "confined" to it.Reporters are urged to include the age of key figures in a story. "After one'ssex," the stylebook says, "few facts say more about a person more efficientlythan providing his or her age." But less precise adjectives like "elderly" or"middle-aged" are discouraged.Labels, economical and helpful, can prove harmful if inexact. Accuracy isessential. And relevance is key.Andrew Alexander can be reached at 202-334-7582 or atombudsman@washpost.com                .
