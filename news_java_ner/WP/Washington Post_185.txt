RICHMOND - Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell has addedan amendment restrictinginsurance coverage for abortion to a bill approved by the General Assemblyestablishing a health-insurance exchange as part of the federal health-careoverhaul.The health-insurance exchange would be managed by the state and allowindividuals and some small businesses to pool together to buy insurance at lowerrates. Some who cannot afford insurance would receive government subsidies.Under the federal law, states were given the option of creating their ownexchanges or using ones operated by the federal government.The bill approved by the General Assembly stated Virginia's intent to create itsown exchange and directed state regulators to determine how to run it.After the bill reached McDonnell (R) for his signature, he added an amendmentthat would prohibit any insurance plan offered as part of the exchange fromcovering abortions except in cases of rape or incest or when the life of thewoman is at risk."The governor does not believe elective abortions should be covered through theexchange or with taxpayer dollars," said McDonnell spokesman Tucker Martin."This is consistent with his pro-life position and policies passed withbipartisan backing at both the state and federal levels."Abortion opponents across the country have been working to get the health-careexchanges to exclude abortion coverage, and similar measures are pending in morethan 20 states. They say a government-managed market should not allow dollars tobe spent on the procedure."Taxpayers don't want to see the government entangled with the abortion issue inany way," said Victoria Cobb, president of the Family Foundation of Virginia.She said seven states have adopted similar legislation.Advocates for abortion rights say the measures are part of a national drive byconservatives to restrict access to abortion.Federal and state law prohibit using tax dollars for abortions except in casesof rape or incest and when the life of the woman is at risk. McDonnell'samendment would extend such prohibitions to insurance plans purchased byindividuals in exchanges.Jessica Honke, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia,called that a "stark departure from the status quo" that woulddisproportionately affect low-income women."He's using every opportunity he can to attack women's health care," said TarinaKeene, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia.McDonnell's proposal also would prohibit insurance companies from sellingoptional riders that cover abortion.The General Assembly will consider McDonnell's amendments Wednesday.A majority must vote to accept the amendment for it to become part of a law.A majority of the GOP-led House of Delegates has expressed support for limitingabortion coverage in the state's health-care exchange.Democrats, who hold a narrow majority in the state Senate, will probably fightthe amendment. But two Democrats in the chamber generally support abortionrestrictions.If both voted to accept the amendment, the chamber would be split 20 to 20, andthe tie-breaking vote would fall to Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling (R), who opposesabortion.The same vote count resulted this year in a new law that adds regulations forabortion clinics.http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2011/02/the_virginia_general_assembly_2.htmlState Sen. Mary Margaret Whipple (D-Arlington County), chairwoman of theDemocratic caucus in the state Senate, said her party would fight the amendment,noting that McDonnell and other Republicans have objected to the federal lawbecause it requires individuals to spend their money on insurance."It's a little ironic," she said. "In this case, they want to tell people whatthey can and can't do with their own money and private companies what they canand can't do with their product."heldermanr@washpost.com
