If the unabashedly pulpy supernatural thriller "Innocence" (based on JaneMendelsohn's unabashedly pulpy supernatural novel of the same name) means to winover the same young-adult crowd that lapped up "Twilight," it needs to do morethan coast on the draft created by that teenage-vampire juggernaut. LikeStephenie Meyer's saga and the hit movies it spawned, "Innocence" may have anattractive young heroine (Sophie Curtis) who falls under the spell of a cabal ofbloodsuckers, but it's a lazy piece of work, even by the low standards ofHollywood horror movies.Curtis plays Beckett, a motherless teen who enrolls in an exclusive New YorkCity prep school for girls, only to discover that the PTA looks like the cast ofthe next "Real Housewives" show. The staff and mothers all seem to be catty,back-arching cougars who strut around in designer dresses, licking their lipswhile eyeing the student population like so much Meow Mix.The homoerotic pedophilia of the script is laughably heavy-handed. At one point,the school nurse (Kelly Reilly) - who has begun dating Beckett's father (LinusRoache), but who seems more interested in his daughter - turns to the girl andsays, "Thank you for . . . having me," with a tone of disturbing insinuationthat would make most sexual predators blush.Beckett is plagued by prophetic nightmares - the result of witnessing aclassmate's suicide barely one week into the school year - that seem to indicatethat the school's staff members are cultivating her and her friends for somenefarious purpose that depends a bit too heavily on our heroine maintaining hervirginity. Yet keeping Beckett's "purity" becomes difficult when she meets Tobey(Graham Phillips), a cute and sensitive boy whose mother is an alumna ofBeckett's school.But where the "Twilight" books and movies managed to make a workable sexualmetaphor out of a vampire's hunger for blood, "Innocence" struggles to create acoherent point. Beckett's emotional turmoil could symbolize adolescent angstabout sexually coming of age - and maybe in the book it did - but the movieseems more about aging female vanity than anything. Instead of gettingfacelifts, the movie's mommy-dearest villainesses maintain their smooth skin byfeasting on the blood of unsullied teenage girls.That's mildly creepy to me. But then again, I'm a grown man. If this nonsense isthe stuff of nightmares for most modern teenage girls, who seem geneticallypredisposed to roll their eyes at anything a parent or teacher does, I'd be verysurprised.michael.osullivan@washpost.comÂ½PG-13.
