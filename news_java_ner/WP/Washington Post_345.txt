As they unveiled the banner  for ChangeTheMascot.org on the second floor of theRitz-Carlton in Georgetown, amid a standing-room-only crowd of cameras, mediaand the concerned, everything came into focus Monday.Before an Oneida Nation leader even called the team name a racial slur for thefirst time from the podium, before a Manhattan psychologist logically connectedthe dots - between the burnt siena-pigmented face on a helmet with the linedrawn through it in the background to the utter hopelessness on reservations -you just knew:Even if he remains in Washington for his entire NFL career, Robert Griffin IIIis not going to retire an R-word.It's not a matter of "if" anymore, but rather "when."The debate over whether a people are denigrated or honored by the name of theWashington NFL team, like the absurd debate over whether the name is a unifyingforce, is over.How many of the more than 5 million American Indians in this country actuallywant the name gone - how many need to be offended - is approaching irrelevant.We're quickly moving past all that.The question is how long before Roger Goodell or any of the NFL commissioner'sbrightest lawyers deem that a prolonged public assault against the name becomesfinancially hazardous to the league's future. Just when is the tipping point?The answer, we found out Monday, is now.League officials have reached out to the Oneida Nation, which sponsored Monday'ssymposium and suddenly has been passed the name-change baton from Suzan ShownHarjo after more than two decades.The NFL, through Adolphus Birch, its senior vice president of labor policy andgovernment affairs, has asked that a meeting originally scheduled for Nov. 22 bemoved up - and, if needed, to the Oneida reservation in Verona, N.Y.Think about that: The NFL, which has spent tens of thousands of dollarsdefending the team from American Indian plantiffs seeking to strip its trademarkin court for the better part of two decades, has offered to go to the res totalk.Tiring of the sustained momentum the issue has gained since the beginning of theyear, including a national radio ad campaign denouncing the team's name in eachcity it plays - tired of the widespread publicity, which runs the gamut from theIndian Country Today media network to NBC's "Meet the Press" - Goodell has sentan emissary to act on his behalf.The commissioner and others also may be tired of team owner Daniel Snyder's coldbrazenness toward the offended. They simply can't take his tone-deafness on theissue anymore; it's bad business.If the NFL is as boxed in as it appears and Birch and others from the leagueoffice aren't going on a patronizing P.R. mission, this is the first step in thematter being taken out of Snyder's hands - the first clear indication that thename is eventually going down.I thought this past winter it might happen within 10 years. My guess now is fiveyears or less, maybe three - and that's just to accommodate the time it willtake to reach a settlement with the team, find a new name and license, marketand promote it.If the matter escalates further and a national boycott of team and leaguesponsors is needed, oh well.Either way, after years of waiting for the caravan of angry protesters to pass,it's over. As Ray Halbritter, the impassioned, thoughtful front man for theOneida Nation said Monday, "This is not going away this time.""We want change, change not only in more than a symbolic way but change in thelives of the American Indian people - particularly our children," Halbrittersaid."I think a potential meeting can only lead to a conversation that will bebeneficial," he added. Asked if Snyder would be a part of the group, Halbritterreplied: "I don't know. If he is, we welcome his participation. But right now,it's only the NFL that is responding to us positively."The leader of the free world saying over the weekend that he would thinkseriously about changing the name was clearly historic news, the first time asitting U.S. president had taken a stand on the issue. It also revealed anothersignificant development: Snyder has hired a crisis management specialist - notjust any chaos control guy but Lanny Davis, who has represented Trent Lott,Martha Stewart, Penn State in the wake of a child sexual-abuse scandal and beenrebuked by human rights groups for trying to portray ruthless foreignwar-mongers as peaceful people.Really, for all the work Harjo did to eradicate the name for parts of threedecades, for everything Halbritter and others do now, the person who did themost to amplify the message of the ChangeTheMascot.org crowd is Snyder himself.When USA Today's Erik Brady asked about the issue in May, the owner's hubris gotthe best of him: "We'll never change the name," Snyder said. "It's that simple.NEVER - you can use caps."That was it. That was enough to mobilize many of the apathetic and ambivalent tojoin the advocates and the hard-core activists. When a billionaire takes aposition as a bully instead of at least acknowledging the people who areoffended, then he starts to lose what middle ground remained.Now he's hired Davis to speak for Burgundy and Gold Nation, whose most ardent,pro-name faction still has no clue there is a larger group of people nowspeaking on behalf of how wrong the team's name is.It's not the Oneida Nation, the Cherokee Nation or any one of 450-plus federallyrecognized sovereign peoples. It's called the world's tribe, and it is biggerand infinitely more powerful than an 80-year-old fan base and its idea of"tradition."Brace yourselves for change. Five years tops, it's gone.
