Health-care harassmentThere is a point in which parliamentary devices become pure and simpleharassment. That point was reached Saturday when Republican leader MitchMcConnell (R-Ky.) prevented the Senate from waiving a rule, as is custom, thusrequiring the Senate clerk to read every word of Majority Leader Harry Reid's300-plus pages of amendments to the health-reform bill.The recitation took place before a nearly empty chamber staffed with boredSenate pages, stenographers, assorted clerks -- and one or two senators guardingthe floor to prevent any Democratic attempt to suspend the reading of the bill.McConnell knows that his maneuver achieves nothing in the long run. Thehealth-reform bill, as successfully negotiated among the Democrats, is going topass. He's only irritating the bill's proponents and further alienating those athome watching the proceedings in hopes of seeing their leaders in action. Nomatter to McConnell.
