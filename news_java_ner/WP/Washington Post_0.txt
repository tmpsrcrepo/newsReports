"We know the numbers: 1 in 5 of every one of those young women who is droppedoff for that first day of school, before they finish school, will be assaultedin her college years."- Vice President Biden, remarks on the release of a White House report on sexualassault, April 29, 2014"It is estimated that 1 in 5 women on college campuses has been sexuallyassaulted during their time there - 1 in 5."- President Obama, remarks at White House, Jan. 22, 2014These quotes may seem old, but the issue is not, especially in the wake of thecontroversy over a Rolling Stone article alleging a gang rape at the Universityof Virginia.Previous reports of sexual assault on college campuses spurred the White Houseearly in 2014 to launch a task force to examine the issue. The group's reportwas issued April 29; the first sentence echoes what both the president and vicepresident have asserted in public: "One in five women is sexually assaulted incollege."Where does this oft-repeated statistic come from? The Fact Checker dug into thedata so you don't have to.The FactsThis statistic is derived from a 2007 study, the Campus Sexual Assault Study,which was conducted for the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice.The researchers also surveyed men, but the statistic in question focuses onwomen, so we will look carefully at that part of the study.In the winter of 2006, researchers used a Web-based survey to interviewundergraduates at two large public universities, one in the Midwest and one inthe South. A total of 5,446 undergraduate women, between the ages of 18 and 25,participated as part of a random sample. The survey was anonymous and took about15 minutes to complete. (Participants received a $10 Amazon.com certificate forparticipating.)So, first of all, it's important to remember that this is a single survey, basedon the experiences of students at two universities. As the researchersacknowledged, these results clearly can be generalized to those two largefour-year universities, but not necessarily elsewhere. Moreover, researchersacknowledged the response rate was relatively low compared with face-to-faceinterviewing.The survey found that 1,073 women, or 19 percent, said that they experiencedattempted or completed sexual assault since entering college. The actualbreakdown was that 12.6 percent experienced attempted sexual assault and 13.7percent experienced actual sexual assault.The sexual assault instances were further divided into sexual assault whileincapacitated from drugs or alcohol or sexual assault through physical force.Most of the sexual assaults were identified as rapes, though the report said"sexual battery" could have included "sexual touching," such as forced kissingor fondling.Note that the percentage of sexual assaults - 13.7 percent - was lower than the1-in-5 figure cited by administration officials. (It is more like 1 in 7.)That's because the president and vice president used careful phrasing thatcovered a student's entire time in college. The overall survey interviewedstudents who included freshmen, sophomores and juniors.In a 2009 report, the researchers released a closer look at the data. Thisreport showed that out of the subset of seniors surveyed (1,402 women), 19percent (about 287) had experienced sexual assault.In other words, information that is localized to the seniors at two colleges hasnow been extrapolated by politicians to the universe of college experience.To some extent, the results depend on how questions are phrased and answersinterpreted.On its Web site, NIJ notes that rapes and other forms of sexual assault areamong the most underreported crimes but that "researchers have been unable todetermine the precise incidence of sexual assault on American campuses becausethe incidence found depends on how the questions are worded and the context ofthe survey." It said that two parallel surveys of American college women wereconducted in 1997 and came up with very different results, with one surveyshowing rapes were 11 times higher than the percentage in the other survey. Thereason appears to be because of how the questions were worded.Earlier this month, the Bureau of Justice Statistics released a study titled "Rape and Sexual Assault Victimization Among College-Age Females, 1995-2013,"which suggested much lower levels of sexual assault than indicated in the CampusSexual Assault Study. But questions have been raised about whether the surveyused for the report, the National Crime Victimization Survey, offers an adequatemeasure of the incidence of rape; a National Research Council report this yearrecommended ways to improve it.Still, the BJS report did indicate interesting trends over time, including thefact that sexual assault on campus had been declining in recent years - and thatthe incidence of sexual assault was higher for women who were not in college.The report also offered a useful guide to the differences between variousstudies of sexual assault on campus, including this caveat about using theCampus Sexual Assault Study: "Because of the limited population included in theCSA, it should not be assumed that findings from the survey are representativeof the population of persons ages 18 to 24 or even to college studentsspecifically."Given that an arm of the Justice Department now has provided this warning aboutthe 1-in-5 statistic, The Fact Checker asked the White House to explain why thepresident and the vice president expressed the data in such sweeping terms.A White House spokesperson, who asked not to be quoted, said that the 1-in-5statistic was consistent with other studies, pointing in particular to twosurveys: a 2000 Justice Department study that reported that, over a seven-monthperiod, 2.8 percent of college women faced rape victimization (completed orattempted) and a 2014 MIT survey that found that 17 percent of femaleundergraduates experienced one or more unwanted sexual behaviors.But there are issues with both surveys. The 2000 report could be interpreted assuggesting that 1 in 5 women might face rape victimization over four or fiveyears in college, but the authors conceded in 2010 that "admittedly, theseprojections are speculative and await longitudinal studies that follow womenthroughout their college careers."Meanwhile, the MIT sample was based on self-selected responses, so its datacould not be used as any sort of confirmation. The university itself warned that"it would be a mistake to use these numbers to generalize about the prevalenceof unwanted sexual behavior in the lives of all MIT students."The Pinocchio TestThe White House should be applauded for calling attention to this issue; as partof its effort, the White House task force is urging colleges to undertakeclimate surveys and pushing for more research on the prevalence of sexualassault.But the BJS warning about the use of CSA data demonstrates the president and thevice president went too far in suggesting the 1-in-5 statistic applied to allcollege students. Instead, this oft-cited statistic comes from a Web-basedsurvey of two large universities, making it misleading to suggest that it isrepresentative of the experience of all college women.Given the uncertainty of the research - and various surveys and anecdotalaccounts indicating there probably is a serious problem of sexual assault oncollege campuses - we are going to limit our ruling to a single Pinocchio. Butwe will monitor how the president, the vice president and other administrationofficials use this statistic in the future.For previous columns, go to washingtonpost.com/factchecker.
