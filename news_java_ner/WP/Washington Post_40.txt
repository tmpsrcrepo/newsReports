You hear that sound? Is that Perry Como on the radio? Because I'm getting apretty strong 1953 vibe here.On the University of Virginia campus, where students are still reeling from aRolling Stone article about an alleged gang rape that probably didn't happen,the backlash from the scandal was strong this week. And, predictably, it wasaimed at women on campus.Sorority sisters were ordered by their national chapters to avoid fraternityevents during bid night this weekend; organizing "sisterhood events" for theirsafety was a suggestion. Some sororities went so far as to plan requiredstay-inside retreats. Are bedazzled chastity belts next? Oh, wait! It's 2015? Mybad. I thought I had stepped into a time machine.Because this Wicked Stepmother edict of locking up the Sweethearts of Sigma Chisounds a lot like the rules in the Michigan State University Associated WomenStudents Handbook, 1953-54. Lots of schools had rules like this in the era ofMRS degrees:"Women students may visit only those men's residences where an officialhousemother employed by the college is present under the following conditions:(1) The housemother must be present.(2) Women may not go above the ground floor.(3) Women students may not visit in men's residences during the morning hours."See, back then, women were treated as though they couldn't make decisions ontheir own, as though they were the problem when it came to unwanted sexualcontact, as though their behavior had to be moderated and controlled and theywere infantilized to keep young men from ravaging them.A housemother was their greatest defense? How different is that from whathappened this week at U-Va.?It was an insult to the women as well as the men.It's not like campus rape is not a huge problem all over the country, despitethe Rolling Stone debacle. One in 5 American women reports being sexuallyassaulted at some point in her life, according to the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention.There are many examples of the college rape problem - no need for a made-upstory sensationalized by a music-and-culture magazine to underscore that fact.(Listen in on a book club or a girls' night out. You'll be surprised at how manywomen tell their own rape stories.)Or just look at the papers. This week, two Vanderbilt University footballplayers - Brandon Vandenburg and Cory Batey, both 21 - were convicted of rapinga 21-year-old neuroscience major. They dragged her around, slapped her on thenaked behind and took turns assaulting her.To make matters worse, Vandenburg recorded the assault and sent the video tofriends while it was happening. He then tried to say he shouldn't be heldresponsible because he just watched. The jury rejected claims that the men weretoo drunk to know what they were doing, and that a college culture of bingedrinking and promiscuous sex should be blamed for the attack.Seriously. That was their defense - that everyone's doing it.In 2015, we're still a herd, even in our institutions of higher learning. Andit's not just the guys who are guilty of heinous peer pressure.Have you seen the wave of wicked sorority grooming requirements burning it uponline? Paging 1953.Makeup! "This means eyebrows waxed, roots dyed, nails done, hair curled orstraightened, makeup done in a neat and clean fashion," one example said.Sororities issued PowerPoint presentations on acceptable shades of turquoise towear, appropriate hairstyles ("No Waves!" one memo screeched) and onedictatorial diva simply said, "cannot express how important Spanx are."Yup, back to 1953. Is your petticoat properly starched?What happened to crusading for your rights, both on campus and off? The womenbefore you had to fight to get on campus, they had to fight to keep thehousemother from signing them in and out like property, they had to fight to getjobs and fight to keep them. We're still fighting.By locking down the sorority sisters instead of fighting for their right to besafe, we assume the worst of our young women. And our young men.Shame on that defense attorney for trying to make the Vanderbilt rape a crime ofcampus culture. Shame on the people who refuse to make alcohol abuse - by menand women - part of this conversation. And shame on the people who have given upon raising good and decent men. Smart men who understand the difference betweenyes and no, power and passion and right from wrong, who have to take charge inthis conversation and lead the way in the cultural shift that must continue.And seriously, ladies, enough with the turquoise and unruly eyebrows. That'spretty darn horrid, too.petula.dvorak@washpost.comTwitter: @petulad√Ø...OE                 To read previous columns, go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak.
