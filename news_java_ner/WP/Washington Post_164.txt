The story of a female badass fighting an army of thugs sent by the mobster/lovershe's informing on, "Everly" is a B movie, in air quotes. It's less an homage tothe kind of grindhouse films celebrated by Quentin Tarantino than it is aslavish aping of Tarantino's postmodern oeuvre itself. The "Pulp Fiction"filmmaker's bloody fingerprints are all over this film's corpse.But director Joe Lynch is no Tarantino. His title character - a vessel of femaleempowerment along the lines of the vengeful bride of "Kill Bill" - is, to put itas charitably as possible, a crock.Salma Hayek makes for a game but only fitfully entertaining Everly. She's thekind of character who, in the good old days, used to be known as a gangster'smoll, but who is here referred to as a "whore" - a term that captures, lesseuphemistically, the transactional nature of her relationship with Taiko(Hiroyuki Watanabe), the Japanese criminal she's been sleeping with and spyingon.Setting the nasty tone for the tale, "Everly" opens with the sounds of Everly'soff-camera gang rape by Taiko's goons. Later, when one of those henchmen (AkieKotabe) - the only one Everly hasn't killed in the gun battle following herassault - points out that he didn't join in, Everly responds, "Should I beoffended?"Yuck.Though meant to be sardonic (I hope), her comment undermines screenwriter YaleHannon's message that female power comes from strength, not sex. Equallyretrograde are the six sexpot assassins who, one after the other, burst throughthe door of Everly's apartment in a variety of skimpy costumes (such as the SexySchoolgirl) before getting killed by the heroine.Yes, it's all in good fun. And there's a certain verve to the way Lynch handlesthe violence, even if he's less of a stylist than Tarantino. But the film'sbrutality - which includes not only the murder of a dog but also a fetishizationof torture that borders on porn - is so excessive, even if tongue-in-cheek, thatit leaves a bad taste in the mouth.Late in the film, one of Everly's tormentors, a man known only as the Sadist(Togo Igawa), shows up with a bloody, half-naked guy in a cage (MasashiFujimoto). The caged guy is introduced as the Masochist. But at that point inthe movie, you may be forgiven for thinking that was your role.michael.osullivan@washpost.comR.
