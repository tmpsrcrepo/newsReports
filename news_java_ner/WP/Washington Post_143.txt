The father said it was still difficult to believe that his daughter and anothergirl were molested during a slumber party, even after the former head of FallsChurch's Democratic Committee was sentenced to 22 years in prison Friday for thecrime.Michael Gardner was a "pillar of the community," as a prosecutor put it - acivic activist, newspaper columnist, and husband of a city councilwoman andformer mayor - the very type of person to which a parent would feel safeentrusting a child."If it didn't happen to my daughter," the girl's father said after the hearing,"I would probably be writing a letter on his behalf."The sentencing in Arlington  County Circuit Court followed a contentious springtrial that pitted a defiant Gardner against the testimony of the 10- and11-year-old girls, one of whom wore sparkly pink sunglasses on the stand becauseshe was nervous.Gardner testified in his defense, denying the allegations. Before his sentencingFriday, he maintained that he had been "falsely accused and wrongfullyconvicted" and said he disdained the law after his experience."A cry for help from one distressed girl has been hijacked and that has cast usinto darkness," he told a packed courtroom.Prosecutors said Gardner went into his basement, where eight of his daughter'sfriends slept during her 10th birthday party in June 2011, and molested two ofthe girls. They said tests showed Gardner's DNA was found on one victim'sunderwear and another's pajamas.After a week of testimony, Gardner was convicted of two counts of sexual batteryand one count of object sexual penetration. The jury recommended a 22-yearsentence.A mistrial was declared on another charge, that he had molested a third girl inthe days before the sleepover. Prosecutors said Friday that they will not pursuea new trial on the last count, saying the girls and their families had beenthrough enough.Defense attorney Peter Greenspun said he would appeal Gardner's conviction.Greenspun said that there were inconsistencies in the girls' testimony and thatprosecutors had failed to thoroughly investigate sperm from one of the girls'fathers, which was found on her pajamas. Prosecutors said it might have seepedinto the pajamas during the wash.Gardner had no previous record of abuse, and the defense submitted 60 lettersfrom family members, friends and business associates that detailed his characterand his work in the Falls Church community. His wife, Robin Gardner, remainsactive in politics and sits on the Falls Church City Council."We will stick by my husband," she said after the hearing. "We will continue onour road of life."Prosecutor Nicole Wittman said Michael Gardner's crimes were particularlypernicious because he had exploited the good standing he had built over theyears. She said he had shown "zero expression of remorse" for what he had done."How do these little girls go anywhere and trust anyone when they couldn't trustthe Gardners, who are the pillars of the community?" Wittman asked.Wittman said the girls had suffered recurring problems since the molestation.One family was forced to install an alarm in the home because the girl wasafraid of another attack. The other feared being alone with her father."We are completely disoriented," the parents of one of the victims wrote in aletter to the court. "We had hoped to make Falls Church our permanent home."Judge Benjamin Kendrick said that the case was one of the most difficult he hadever seen but that the jury had not erred."They did not believe you," Kendrick told Gardner.justin.jouvenal@washingtonpost.com
