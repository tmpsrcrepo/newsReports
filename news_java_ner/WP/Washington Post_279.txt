Some of the ways we honor our men and women in the military:l A free doughnut at Krispy Kreme.l Free seats at the ballgame - you can salute these brave troops on theJumbotron!l A free small Slurpee at 7-Eleven (but only between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m., NOT 7a.m. to 11 p.m., mind you).l And even - wait for this - a FREE Bloomin' Onion at Outback Steakhouse!Some of the ways we disrespect the men and women who have lost their lives incombat:lWe mix up their remains at Arlington National Cemetery.l We bury them under the wrong headstones.On this Veterans Day, it's hard not to feel outraged. And not just about the waythe men and women who have served our country sometimes get treated.It's been impossible to read the news these past few weeks without beingconfronted by the dreadful decay in our communities and our character.At a fancy Bethesda yoga store, a woman begging for help during her brutalmurderwas overheard by her neighbors but not saved.At a prestigious public university a few hours away from us, little boys withlittle privilege were allegedly raped and abused, but the adults who allegedlyknew didn't stop it because they really, really liked their Penn State footballprogram.And we learned this week that when some young men and women gave their lives inservice to the country and came home in unrecognizable pieces, their remainswere sometimes tossed in a landfill.It is horrifying to hear all the rhetoric about supporting our troops and seethe small ways businesses offer gestures of appreciation for our warriors whilea few of our own government institutions have treated the remains of those wholost their lives so poorly.The family members of the dead never knew that parts of their loved ones werecremated and dumped at a Virginia landfill, according to articles by TheWashington Post's Craig Whitlock and Greg Jaffe this week.It is difficult to hear the grief of someone who has lost a loved one in battle.They choke up in tears, puff up in pride and crumble in despair. You shift, putyour pen down, sometimes try to hold your own emotions in check as you give thema moment to catch their breath and go on.They sometimes wonder why their baby or sweetheart or best friend had to die sobrutally, so far away.There are 6,274 of these families in America today.And then, as if it couldn't get worse, it did for some.Gari-Lynn Smith told The Post that she was "appalled and disgusted" by the waythe Air Force had disposed of some of her husband's remains after he was killedin Iraq in 2006."My only peace of mind in losing my husband was that he was taken to Dover andthat he was handled with dignity, love, respect and honor," Smith told The Post."That was completely shattered for me when I was told that he was thrown in thetrash."This latest horror came after the government's investigations into how Dover AirForce Base's mortuary has been handling the remains of troops killed abroad.Those investigations showed that the mortuary also lost body parts, mishandledand mislabled them, and even further mangled them -in one case sawing off aMarine's arm so he could better fit into a coffin.Some of the mortuary officials were disciplined, but none was fired.This sounds very much like the scandal that The Post's Christian Davenport wroteabout at Arlington Cemetery last year, where urns were dug up and dumped in dirtpiles, remains were misplaced and misidentified, and Congress launched aninvestigation into the contracts of most of the work done there.Now that we know how some of our dead veterans have been treated, let's take amoment to stop thinking about Macy's Veterans Day sale and ponder how veteranswho make it home alive are doing.It's more likely for a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, rather than a civilian,to be unemployed. Recent vets had an unemployment rate last month of 12.1percent, according to the Labor Department, compared with9 percent forcivilians.http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/economy-adds-80k-jobs-in-oct-unemployment-dips-to-9percent/2011/11/04/gIQAt2ynlM_story.html"We ask our men and women in uniform to leave theircareers, leave their families and risk their lives to fight for our country,"President Obama said in a speech last month in Virginia. "The last thing theyshould have to do is fight for a job when they come home."They return from battle, often broken, and were subjected to appallingconditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center before it was shut down this year.Some lose limbs or suffer from head trauma. One in six return withpost-traumatic stress disorder, and suicide rates have skyrocketed.Many service members have endured multiple deployments. I talked to the motherof a 6-year-old who was on her third deployment since her child was born.They all deserve better from us than a small Slurpee.dvorakp@washpost.com
