A man walks up to a woman on a Metro train and tells her she looks good in thatskirt.Is that an insult, sexual harassment or a compliment?A grass-roots group says it's a form of "street harassment" that has become alltoo common throughout the transit network.Members of http://www.collectiveactiondc.org/-URL-Collective Action for SafeSpaces/Holla Back DC said they will speak about sexual harassment Wednesdaybefore the D.C. Council's Committee on Government Operations. Metro GeneralManager Richard Sarles and some of his senior staff are expected to testify onthe transit agency's performance over the past year. Council member MurielBowser (D-Ward 4), who is also on the Metro board, heads the committee.Collective Action, according to its Web site, fights "street harassment inAmerica's capital by empowering Washingtonians to speak out against gender-basedsexual harassment and assault."Chai Shenoy, co-founder of Collective Action, said her group is worried aboutthe stories it receives and posts on its Web site about sexual harassmentonbuses and trains and at Metro stops.The group, which has been around since 2009, was started as an online forumwhere people could submit their accounts of public sexual harassment and assaultincidents. It has eight board members, plus three volunteer staffers and severaldozen volunteers, Shenoy said.She helped start the group after a passenger exposed himself to her while shewas on a nearly empty rail car on the Red Line one weekend."I didn't know what to do and feared for my safety," she said. "I wanted to dosomething and share my experience with others."Shenoy said she has called and e-mailed Metro about some of the incidents thathave been reported to the Web site but has received only a generic e-mailresponse."We're shocked about how much sexual harassment occurs," Shenoy said.http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dr-gridlock/post/metro-transit-police-deploy-decoys-to-catch-alleged-thieves/2011/11/16/gIQAFq1JSN_blog.html-URL-Metro Transit Police Deputy Chief RonPavlik said his department takes reports of sexual harassment and sexual assaultincidents seriously. He says the transit police have have not seen an increasein reports of indecent exposure, rape or other types of sexual assaults.According to Metro, 84 cases involving sexual offenses were reported to TransitPolice last year. They included one rape and 40 cases of indecent exposure orother sexual acts. Of the 40, 12 involved arrests.Officials said Metro does not track sexual harassment complaints. But Pavliksaid passengers who think that they have been sexually harassed should reportthe incident to http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dr-gridlock/post/metro-transit-police-chief-addresses-riders-concerns/2011/09/21/gIQABq4BmK_blog.html-URL-Transit Police. Officers receive sensitivitytraining in handling such complaints, he said.He cautioned, however, that a variety of behaviors could be consideredharassment."Someone telling another person: 'You look good. Can I have your phone number?'- you may not like it, but I can't arrest the person," Pavlik said.Reports including sexual assault and indecent exposure are investigated, hesaid.Last year, Transit Police received reports of two men touching passengers andallegedly masturbating  on the Orange and Red lines.A man was arrested in the Red Line case. Another man was arrested in theincidents on the Orange Line and underwent a mental-health evaluation, policesaid.Shenoy said Collective Action wants to testify before the D.C Council so thatofficials "take sexual harassment seriously."The group also is pushing for Metro employees to receive training on dealingwith passengers who report sexual harassment and assaults and for more trainingfor Transit Police officers.Shenoy said the group also wants to see Metro undertake a public servicecampaign to educate people on such issues, similar to its "See Something, SaySomething" anti-terrorism campaign."Metro can do a lot more than it has done, which to this date and to myknowledge is very little," Shenoy said.hedgpethd@washpost.com
