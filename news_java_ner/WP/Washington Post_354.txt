Republican presidential candidate Rick http://www.washingtonpost.com/rick-santorum-2012-presidential-candidate/gIQA61AHdO_topic.html-URL- Santorumhas  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/primary-tracker/-URL-won four states  and risensuddenly to challenge Mitt Romney as the http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/behind-the-numbers/post/rick-santorum-now-rivals-mitt-romney-in-popularity-poll-finds/2012/02/01/gIQAXmNhDR_blog.html-URL- leader in the national polls .Now he faces a new hurdle: defining himself positively before others rush todisqualify him.Santorum presents himself as a committed and consistent conservative withblue-collar roots - just the kind of candidate Republicans need to energize theparty's base and reach out to Reagan Democrats in a campaign against PresidentObama that could be decided in the nation's industrial heartland.Obama advisers and other Democrats see a Santorum whose record, writings andstatements, particularly on social issues, will be used to portray him as fartoo conservative for many voters. His record, they say, could make Santorumanathema to suburban swing voters, especially women. That view is shared by someRepublicans and independent analysts."They [Democrats] would brutalize him on social and cultural issues and presenthim as so far out of the mainstream as to be radical," said G. Terry Madonna,director of the  http://www.fandm.edu/politics-URL-Center for Politics andPublic Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College  and a leading pollster inPennsylvania. "The analogy would be Barry Goldwater" - the 1964 GOP nominee whosuffered a landslide defeat.Santorum's advisers recognize that he has entered a new phase in  http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/santorum-enters-presidential-race/2011/06/06/AGvY7HKH_gallery.html-URL-his campaign , and they see the obstacles ahead. They argue that a full andfair reading of his record reveals a more attractive profile of the formersenator. But they acknowledge it is up to Santorum and his campaign to explainthat record and allay concerns about his ability to run competitively inNovember."There will be people - Romney and the Democrats - who will try to distort thesethings," said John Brabender, Santorum's longtime political adviser. "It's theresponsibility of our campaign to show what the senator's record really is. Weare confident that once that happens, people will understand that the senator isextremely reasonable."The first tests will come over the next 10 days, as Santorum attempts toleverage his new prominence against Romney in primaries in Arizona andespecially  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/today-on-the-trail-romney-santorum-face-off-in-michigan/2012/02/15/gIQA1iKeGR_blog.html-URL-Michigan , and then on Super Tuesday,March 6.Romney and the super PAC backing his campaign have  http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/in-first-direct-criticism-of-santorum-in-weeks-romney-says-rival-isnt-a-fiscal-conservative/2012/02/17/gIQA1JjQKR_story.html-URL-begun to attackSantorum  - though not for being too conservative. That may be too risky for acandidate  http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romney-reframes-himself-as-a-severely-conservative-governor/2012/02/14/gIQAaMiqHR_story.html-URL-whose conservative credentials are alreadyconsidered suspect  by many on the right.Instead, they say Santorum strayed from his conservative moorings whenever itwas politically convenient to do so. He backed earmarks for projects in hisstate and district. He voted, as did many in his party, to raise the debtceiling repeatedly. He backed higher spending to pay for prescription drugbenefits under Medicare. He was cozy with labor unions, an importantconstituency in Pennsylvania.Those issues likely will be prime topics at Wednesday'shttp://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/15/submit-your-questions-for-the-next-cnn-debate-in-arizona/-URL-GOP debate in Arizona , and Santorum advisers saythey are eager to take on Romney and his attacks in that forum. Romney, theysay, is the GOP candidate with questionable conservative credentials, and theyare determined to win that definitional battle.Santorum's stancesMore problematic are the issues that could hurt Santorum in a general election.Like most Republicans, he opposes abortion, but his stance is more restrictivethan many. He opposes abortions in all cases except when the life of the motheris in danger. He would not make exceptions for rape and incest. Santorum alsosaid he would favor legislation that would allow prosecution of doctors whoperform abortions, a position he reaffirmed Saturday in Ohio.The recent White House  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/the-white-houses-convenient-contraception-controversy/2012/02/09/gIQAeOfm2Q_blog.html-URL-missteps on contraception  gave Santorum, a devoutRoman Catholic, an opportunity to attack the administration on grounds ofreligious freedom. But  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/rick-santorum-and-women-a-history-of-his-comments/2012/02/10/gIQAHbNP4Q_blog.html-URL-broader issues of women's rights  presentpotential problems for his candidacy.Though he has voted in favor of contraception, he has  http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/rick-santorum-is-surging-but-faces-intensifying-scrutiny-over-contraception-position/2012/02/17/gIQAAZePKR_story.html-URL-said of birth control , "Idon't think it's a healthy thing for our country." He said he thought it was"harmful to women . . . harmful to society." He has said states have the rightto ban contraception, though he would not vote for such a law.On the role of women, he wrote in his 2005 book,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193223683X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=washingtonpost-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=193223683X-URL-"ItTakes a Family,"  "Radical feminists succeeded in undermining the traditionalfamily and convincing women that professional accomplishments are the key tohappiness. As for children? Well, to paraphrasehttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402766254/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=washingtonpost-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1402766254-URL-'TheWizard of Oz,'  pay no attention to those kids behind the curtain."He opposes same-sex marriage, as do politicians in both parties, including thepresident. But some years ago, he accused leaders in the gay community ofleading a "jihad" against him over  http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A7390-2003Apr21?language=printer-URL-comments he had made  in whichhe appeared to equate gay sex with bigamy and polygamy and more.Those comments came during an interview with the Associated Press in 2003, aftera Supreme Court decision that struck down anti-sodomy laws. "If the SupremeCourt says that you have the right to consensual [gay] sex within your home,then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have theright to incest, you have the right to adultery," he said. "You have the rightto anything."In 2005, he intervened in the case of  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15423-2005Mar31.html-URL-Terri Schiavo , a Florida woman whohad been in a vegetative state for years. He and other Washington politiciansurged that a federal judicial panel review a state court decision authorizingthe removal of her feeding tube. He also met in Florida with her parents, whoopposed the removal, to pray with them.On environmental issues, he not only has opposed cap-and-trade legislation todeal with  http://www.washingtonpost.com/linksets/2010/07/06/ABcLr7D_linkset.html-URL-global climate change but  alsohas dismissed the issue as "the global warming hoax."Explaining his remarksSantorum has gone to some lengths to try to  http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rick-santorum-has-honed-his-image-along-the-gop-campaign-trail/2012/02/09/gIQAHNjy6Q_story.html-URL-explain some of these comments . In some cases,the full context softens the impact of the most inflammatory words and phrases.But the trail he has left behind provides ample fodder for his critics andopponents.Gary Bauer, a leading social conservative and a Santorum supporter, said that ifhandled well, the candidate's views on social issues, particularly with regardto the family, can attract votes from many working-class Americans. They arewinners, he believes."Everything on the agenda of a conservative Republican Party requires thewillingness and commitment to speak in more than 30-second sound bites," hesaid.He added: "You have to choose your words carefully, but I disagree seriously, asyou well know, with elites, including Republican elites. I'm not suggestingbuilding a whole campaign on this. . . . But you can't run from this stuff."Santorum advisers say that for every seemingly questionable statement, there isan explanation. His position on same-sex marriage is not different than Romney'sor Obama's, they say. His views on women and the workplace have been totallymisinterpreted. What he means is that women who choose to stay at home and raisetheir children should be prized by society as much as those who work outside thehome.In case that hasn't gotten through, advisers say Santorum's wife, Karen, willbecome a more visible presence on the campaign trail, and the campaign intendsto have women who have worked for him out as surrogates.On the Schiavo case, Santorum said in a  http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/florida-gop-debate-romney-calls-gingrich-influence-peddler-ramps-up-attacks/2012/01/24/gIQANqngNQ_story.html-URL-debate in Florida  last month that hehappened to be in Florida at the time and went to Tampa to be with her parents,at their request. They were, he said, constituents who had asked for hisassistance."I will agree that everything Rick Santorum says is not poll tested," Brabendersaid. But he said he is confident that, given a chance, Santorum can make hiscase to voters willing to give him a fair shot. On birth control and women'srights, for example, he said, "When people listen to the beginning, middle andend of what Rick Santorum says, people will say that's a very reasonableposition."But in the rough-and-tumble fight of a presidential campaign, Santorum could endup being buried in 30-second ads, whether from Romney and his PAC or in ageneral election, if he gets that far. A penchant for provocative language andaggressiveness has marked his career from the start.He 'outworked everybody'Santorum has always been a politician in a hurry. He won election to the Housein 1990 despite being an underdog against a Democratic incumbent. Most officialsat the National Republican Congressional Committee dismissed his chances anddeclined to give him the help he wanted. He won anyway."He just outworked everybody," said Terry Holt, a GOP strategist who as a youngNRCC staffer was one of the few who saw Santorum's potential that year.Despite being put into a more Democratic district, he won reelection in 1992with 61 percent of the vote.In the House, he became a member of the Gang of Seven, a group of freshmanRepublicans that included now-House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who railedagainst the scandal at the House Bank and House Post Office. Their effortshelped undermine the Democratic majority, paving the way for the Republicantakeover in 1994.Even as a new House member, Santorum was looking to move up. In 1994, a goodyear for Republicans, he defeated incumbent Democratic senator Harris Wofford.He brought many of the same partisan tactics that were commonplace inthen-speaker Newt Gingrich's House to the more sedate Senate. He took onconservative causes, playing a key role in the passage of welfare reform. Hecreated resentment with his hard-charging ways and partisan elbows.Reelected in 2000, he won the number three post in the party's leadership. Whilechampioning conservative causes, he continued to pay attention to the needs ofPennsylvania. He supported increases in the minimum wage and opposedright-to-work legislation (which he now says he would support as president). Hecontinued to work cooperatively with then-Republican senator Arlen Specter,though they disagreed on most social issues.Pollster Madonna, who described Santorum's conservatism as "pretty genuine . . .the real deal," said Romney can make a plausible argument that, as a senator,Santorum supported measures that today look like conservative heresy. But hesaid that shows how once-routine actions, even for conservatives, have beenreinterpreted in the tea-party-dominated Republican Party."Republicans supported programs and pork and earmarks for their state,especially when you get into a state like Pennsylvania or Ohio, which had lostjobs because of the end of the industrial revolution," he said.Former Pennsylvania governor Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat, said the attacks byRomney "are correct but there are reasons for them. He [Santorum] played by therules of the game. Earmarks were commonplace and he worked to make surePennsylvania got its fair share of them, sometimes at my request as mayor [ofPhiladelphia] or governor."David Urban, a lobbyist and former Specter chief of staff who supportsSantorum's candidacy, called Santorum pragmatic in his approach as a senator. "Isay he was pragmatic because he was a guy who knew how to get reelected in astate that definitely was not as conservative as he was personally but withoutyielding on his principles," he said.After his 2000 election, say some longtime Santorum watchers, the senator becamemore outspoken on social issues, almost as if on a mission. But what may havebeen most remarkable about his career to that point is that someone asconservative as Santorum could continue to win elections in a state that hasbeen as closely divided ideologically as Pennsylvania.As one Pennsylvania Republican put it, "He was able to run through the raindropswithout getting wet." As his views became better known, and as the politicalclimate turned against him, his ideology caught up with him.That was in 2006, when he drew as his opponent Robert P. Casey Jr., the statetreasurer and son of a revered former governor. Casey also happened to be aDemocrat who opposed abortion and gun control. In a year when Democrats tookback control of the House and Senate, Santorum got wiped out, losing by 18points, the most of any incumbent Republican defeated that year.Predicting problemsA Republican and a Democratic strategist said independently that the 2006 racemay not be a good measure of Santorum's viability or strength as a candidate,given the conditions. They point to his earlier campaigns as proof that he is ashrewd strategist and a dogged and effective campaigner. Another view is that,until 2006, he had been lucky in drawing weak opponents in reelection campaigns.The implication of that is, if he was to become the Republican nominee, theweakness he showed in the suburbs of Philadelphia that year would be replicatedin state after battleground state. Karl Rove, speaking Friday on Sean Hannity'sprogram on Fox News, said Santorum's position on contraception will be "hard toexplain" to a general election audience.Privately, strategists in both parties predict huge problems for Santorum. A GOPstrategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to be candid, predictedthat Santorum would be "eviscerated" by the Democrats in a general election. ADemocrat who knows Santorum's record intimately and who also spoke on conditionof anonymity to offer candid analysis, said Santorum would be "a Martian towomen in the suburbs.""I love Rick Santorum," the GOP strategist said. "But they're going to put thewood to him. He'll get defined by the Obama people so fast he won't know whathit him."Obama advisers made it known this week that they have begun to look moreseriously at  http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-campaign-turns-attention-to-santorum/2012/02/17/gIQAV0qKKR_story.html-URL-Santorum as a prospective rival , but already they see vulnerabilitiesthey would try to exploit.GOP strategist Holt said Santorum may not be more conservative than many othersin the party, "but he's said and done things that are off-key" and that haveundermined his potential appeal."This is his moment to shine," he added, "but now it becomes not so much amatter of ideology but of tone. There's no question that he's very conservative.Now it's how he handles questions that will be the test."balzd@washpost.comStaff researcher Lucy Shackelford contributed to this report.
