NBC News has re-upped David Gregory as anchor of its Sunday Beltway show "Meetthe Press."Gregory's been the show's host for the past four years. He replaced Tim Russert,who had the gig for 16 years until he died on the job in June 2008.This TV season, "Meet the Press" is averaging 3.2 million viewers - second tothe CBS Sunday Beltway show "Face the Nation" (3.3 million). The first half is,anyway. CBS News breaks its show into two programs for ratings purposes because,as it has explained in the past, the second, newer half-hour does not have asmany station clearances as the first half-hour. ("Face 1" is cleared in 99percent of the country, while "Face 2" is available in 84 percent.)Since Russert's final full season, "MtP" has lost 20 percent of its audience."FtN," on the other hand - which is still anchored by Bob Schieffer - has gained23 percent.ABC's "This Week," now anchored once again by George Stephanopoulos, trails theother two programs with an average audience of 2.7 million this season. On thebright side, that's up considerably compared with The Christiane Amanpour Years.Before taking over the anchor chair on "MtP," Gregory was NBC News's chief WhiteHouse correspondent; he joined NBC in '95.CNN shuffles hostsCNN is sweeping aside its morning-show host, Soledad O'Brien, to make way fornew network chief Jeff Zucker's better idea: a morning show anchored by ChrisCuomo and Erin Burnett.O'Brien, who has been with CNN since 2003, is being segued into a production anddistribution deal with the cable news network.Under the terms of her deal, she will produce three specials for CNN in 2014."The new partnership opportunity allows me to focus on what I love to do themost, and to focus on the next stage of my career, owning my own work," O'Briensaid in Thursday's announcement.'Rihanna: SVU'After flopping with a February "sweep" stunt in which a convicted rapist wascast as a rape victim, "Law & Order: SVU" - now a sadder but wiser sex-crimesdrama - has gone back to what the franchise does best: rip from the headlines.This time, it's Chris Brown and Rihanna.On the final night of the February sweep next week, an episode called "FunnyValentine" will feature a story line about a rising young music star who isphysically beaten by her high-profile music-star boyfriend. The victim refusesto help the prosecution and, despite Mariska Hargitay's best efforts, continuesto put herself in danger. Meanwhile, the case gets turned into a media circusbecause of the antics of the abuser guy and his attorney (Jeffrey Tambor).Over its lifetime, the "Law & Order" franchise has become famous for rippingfrom the headlines, with just enough tinkering to keep lawyers at bay. Oftenthat tinkering involves someone getting snuffed.We hope the episode will make some noise for NBC, which is poised to finish theFebruary sweep in fifth place among the 18-to-49-year-olds who are the network'sad-sales holy grail.That would mark the first time that the network has finished behind Univision inthe age bracket during a sweep. So far, Univision has beaten NBC every night ofthe sweep.Among NBC's February sweep ratings debacles: The highly hyped launch of itsJekyll/Hyde doc drama, "Do No Harm," resulted in historically low ratings andwas quickly euthanized, and the Season 2 launch of "Smash" crashed and burned.Just a year ago, NBC easily won the February sweep. On the other hand, NBC lastyear had the Super Bowl and "The Voice."Arnett in CBS showAnother nail in the coffin of NBC's "Up All Night": Star Will Arnett has beencast to star in a new CBS comedy from "Raising Hope's" Greg Garcia.Arnett will play a recently divorced guy whose parents aren't getting along,reports Deadline.com.Arnett is still contractually bound to "Up All Night." CBS gets him only if "Up"is canceled."Up" is on a steep downhill path. Its ratings have been very weak, but thenetwork decided to have another crack at it, while turning it from asingle-camera comedy to a multi-cam sitcom with a live studio audience and laughtrack.Not long thereafter, Arnett's co-star, Christina Applegate, announced that shewas taking a powder.'Americans' pickupFX has picked up "The Americans" for a 13-episode second season.The pickup comes four episodes into the first season of the drama, which starsKeri Russell and Matthew Rhys as married KGB spies posing as American travelagents in suburban Washington during the Reagan years.The show's unveiling, which averaged 5.1 million viewers, was the most-watchedFX series debut in the network's history.demoraesl@washpost.comTo read previous columns by Lisa de Moraes, go to washingtonpost.com/tvblog.
