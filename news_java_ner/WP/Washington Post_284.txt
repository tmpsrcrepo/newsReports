This week two years ago, the seemingly never-ending free-for-all otherwise knownas the 2012 Republican presidential primary race was finally effectively over,with  Rick Santorum  calling it quits. ( Newt Gingrich  didn't officially dropout for a few more weeks, and claimed to be the last conservative standing, butSantorum was the only "real" thorn left in  Mitt Romney 's side in April 2012.)The focus is now on 2016, but some members of the ragtag field from 2012 arestill paying off debts from their failed campaigns. The Federal ElectionCommission filing deadline was Tuesday, so here's a quick look at how much theRepublican hopefuls still owed as of the end of March.l Michele Bachmann: $46,353.23. Bachmann's debt comes from legal fees. As Loopfans will recall, she is under investigation for allegedly violating campaignfinance laws and was also sued for a separate campaign indiscretion.l Herman Cain:  $175,000. Cain is in debt to himself for loans he made to hispresidential campaign that are billed as travel expenses.l Rick Santorum:  $496,401.09. Santorum owes money to 11 companies, most of it -$430,487.74 - to his old friend  John Brabender . Brabender, a GOP mediaconsultant, ran Santorum's campaign.l Newt Gingrich: $4,721,538.68. Gingrich seems to owe a lot of folks money,including $649,117.54 to himself for travel expenses. He owes nearly a milliondollars for private air travel.Rick Perry  and  Ron Paul  are debt-free. So is Romney.From secretary to senatorIf  Kathleen Sebelius  makes a run for the U.S. Senate in Kansas - as she isconsidering, according to the New York Times - the outgoing secretary of healthand human services could join a long list of branch-crossers who went from anappointed Cabinet position to an elected Senate seat, including two currently inoffice.With an assist from the Senate historian's office, we picked 10 from the dozensof politicians Sebelius would join if she runs and wins a Senate seat (which,according to a Public Policy Polling survey of Kansas voters, would prove quitea challenge).1.
