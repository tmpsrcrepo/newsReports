'The November Man' is a generic, unthrilling thriller        Pierce Brosnanscowls his way through the instantly forgettable, unthrilling thriller 'TheNovember Man.' Pierce Brosnan is an ex-spy who looks as bored as the viewers ofhis forgettable new film."The November Man" is less a movie than cinematic filler, the kind ofaudio-visual wallpaper meant to keep movie screens occupied with bland,instantly forgettable product while "Guardians of the Galaxy" plays itself outand better, smarter movies settle nervously into their gates for the fall awardsrace.For most of this generic, unthrilling thriller, Pierce Brosnan practices -unsuccessfully - a sexy scowl, an expression that makes him look either tetchyor mildly peeved, depending on how many explosions he's dodging. Brosnan playsan ex-CIA agent named Devereaux who is pulled back into service by his old matesand winds up in the middle of a shadowy conspiracy involving a sleazy Russianpolitician and some dubious doings in Chechnya.His ally in this shifting landscape of loyalties and misplaced trust is astatuesque social worker named Alice (the eye-popping Olga Kurylenko), who atone point simply  must  don a sequined miniskirt, sky-high heels and a magentawig in order to get the bad guy, because . . . well, she just has to.Roger Donaldson makes efficient hack work of a script adapted from a book byBill Granger. Stringing together every cliche, trope and cherished chestnut fromthe established canon of Thrillers 101, Donaldson dutifully puts his charactersin their assigned places without flourish, fuss or inspiration. Words such as"ops" and "exfil" are tossed around like so many bread crumbs on a fish pond,the better to bring viewers to the surface so they can be whacked on the head bybrutish but mercifully quickly moving violence.Those moments are so predictable, and executed with such workmanliketediousness, that the action is actually pulse- slowing , which may beappropriate for a protagonist whose main motivation is simply to get back to aplacid retirement in Switzerland. "The November Man" turns out to be the classicAugust movie: a triumph of competence over imagination and schlock over taste.Its highest value lies in reminding filmgoers that fall can't come too soon.ann.hornaday@washpost.comThe November ManrR.
