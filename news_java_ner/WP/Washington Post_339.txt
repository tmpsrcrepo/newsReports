Kevin Clash, the puppeteer behind "Sesame Street's" Elmo since the early '80s,has resigned from the show after a second man filed a lawsuit Tuesday, accusinghim of a sexual relationship with an underage male and seeking $5 million indamages.News of the second allegation comes shortly after the first man - who hadrecanted his allegation that he was a minor when he first had sex with Clash -let it be known Monday that he wanted to recant his recantation and return a$125,000 settlement."I am resigning from Sesame Workshop with a very heavy heart," Clash saidTuesday in a statement."I have loved every day of my 28 years working for this exceptionalorganization," he continued. "Personal matters have diverted attention away fromthe important work 'Sesame Street' is doing and I cannot allow it to go on anylonger. I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolvingthese personal matters privately."Sesame Workshop said Tuesday in a statement: "None of us [at Sesame Workshop],especially Kevin, want anything to divert our attention from our focus onserving as a leading educational organization. . . . Unfortunately, thecontroversy surrounding Kevin's personal life has become a distraction that noneof us want, and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job.. . .This is a sad day for 'Sesame Street.' "The second accuser is suing Clash, 52, in federal court, alleging that he had asexual relationship with the puppeteer while he was a minor. Cecil Singletonseeks more than $5 million in damages, according to the Web site TMZ, whichfirst obtained the court documents.In the suit, Singleton, 24, said he "did not become aware that he had sufferedadverse psychological and emotional effects from Kevin Clash's sexual acts andconduct until 2012."Clash, a Baltimore area native, had been on leave from the lauded PBS children'sshow since news broke this month about the first accuser.NBC's mighty returnNBC - once home to "St. Elsewhere" and "ER,"              "Seinfeld" and"Cheers," Johnny Carson and "ALF" - has finally clawed its way back to the landof the prime-time living after being buried for years in theprogram-to-the-margins underworld of former chief Jeff Zucker.NBC will win its first November "sweep" in nine years among 18-to-49-year-oldviewers, who are the currency of the TV business - jumping from a fourth-placefinish last November.The network decided to celebrate by putting NBC Entertainment Chairman BobGreenblatt on the phone with reporters Tuesday as another full week's ratingswere issued, officially sealing the deal."We're very happy this November - the first time we've been this happy in a longtime," Greenblatt began, well, happily.Then some Debbie Downer on the call kicked off the Q&A period by askingGreenblatt whether he thought NBC would remain in first place in the firstquarter of '13, when "The Voice" and "Revolution" are on hiatus (and CBS has theSuper Bowl and Fox has Nicki Minaj wreaking havoc on "American Idol")."We expect a pretty significant leveling of the playing field, but we knew thatgoing in," Greenblatt acknowledged. But, he said, "we just feel like, to startout this strong heading into what we know will be a tough winter, feels like abig accomplishment."Plus, Greenblatt forecast that in March, when "The Voice" and "Revolution"return, NBC will be back in the game in a big way.Then along comes Negative Nell, wondering what Greenblatt thought the odds wereof NBC's finishing the whole TV season (mid-September to late May) ranked No. 1.But Greenblatt's happiness was too strong for them:"I feel pretty confident we will not end up in fourth place again this year," hebegan."I'd be astonished if we ended up being No. 1, given the firepower some of theother networks have, but thrilled if we landed at 2 and really pleased if justin third place. . . . Third place would be a triumph for us."The reporter noted, as if meaning it to sting, that NBC had finished last seasonin third place.Greenblatt countered pleasantly that last year, NBC had the Super Bowl.That shut 'em up.'Boss' is cannedPay-cable network Starz has canceled Kelsey Grammer's "Boss" because the show'ssecond season clocked fewer viewers than its first.The second season, which wrapped its 18 episodes in mid-October, averaged about940,000 viewers across multiple plays. That's not far behind the ratings forStarz's "Magic City."On the other hand, Starz had domestic rights on "Boss," while it owns "MagicCity" outright and therefore reaps the benefit of its latter show's saleinternationally. You do the math."Boss" opened with a bang. Starz CEO Chris Albrecht ordered a second seasonbefore the first even premiered in October 2011.But the ratings weren't stellar, and, during a Q&A at Summer TV Press Tour 2012in August, show creator Farhad Safinia said he was "heartbroken" with the firstseason's numbers - while Grammer played the king and took a phone call onstagefrom his wife, irking a hotel ballroom's worth of TV critics who might havehelped goose the second season's ratings. Too late now.Grammer, who believes he did not get an Emmy nomination for his first season on"Boss" because he's a Republican, played a Chicago mayor suffering secretly froma neurological disorder.demoraesl@washpost.comTo read previous columns by Lisa de Moraes, go to washingtonpost.com/tvblog.
