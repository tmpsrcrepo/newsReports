After what allegedly happened to "Victim 2," a boy estimated to be 10 years old,in the same room where Penn State football players shower, it's near impossibleto keep reading the grand jury's report. By "Victim 8," numbness turns to anger.You want to scream at the traumatized graduate assistant coach in 2002 andjanitor in 2000 who saw and didn't stop it, according to the report released bythe Pennsylvania attorney general's office. You want to grab hold of and shakethose who reported the crime only to their superiors, washed their hands ofresponsibility and then let it go, treating a kid's life as if it were afootball that slipped through their hands.Most of all, you want to have an audience with one of sports' most endearingicons, Joe Paterno, Happy Valley's homespun saint, and ask Joe Pa, repeatedly,"While you were regaling everyone with sappy tales about meeting your wife 50years ago over ice cream at the local creamery in State College, Pa., did youhave any idea what your longtime defensive coordinator was doing in the companyof young boys?"If the Pennsylvania attorney general's office is to be taken at its word - ifthe sad, sickening details of alleged sexual abuse of young boys by JerrySandusky are true - a once-immaculate program thought of as beyond reproach isnow close to beyond redemption.Paterno wasn't charged, but if Sandusky is guilty, Paterno would be guilty -just as Penn State's athletic director and a university vice president, who werecharged with perjury and failure to report suspected child abuse on Saturday,would be guilty.They would all be party to a worse crime than any crooked, pay-for-play boosterat Miami, Ohio State or even SMU ever committed: guilty of protecting a programbefore a child.You can't read the 23-page grand jury report and come to any other conclusion;Penn State football and its pristine reputation apparently superseded thealleged sexual assault of a young boy - perhaps as many as eight young boys -over 15 years by Sandusky.Joe Pa knew, if the charges are true.They all knew.And they never told police.Penn State's president and other university officials are standing behind TimCurley, the athletic director, and Gary Schultz, the senior vice president offinance and business. They maintained both men handled a 2002 complaint aboutSandusky properly - given what they knew of the situation at the time."I wish to say that Tim Curley and Gary Schultz have my unconditional support,"Penn State President Graham Spanier said in a statement, which an athleticdepartment official said would be the school's only comment on the matter. "Ihave known and worked daily with Tim and Gary for more than 16 years. I havecomplete confidence in how they have handled the allegations about a formerUniversity employee."In the statement issued by Penn State, the attorneys for Curley and Schultz saidtheir clients are not guilty. Sandusky's attorney told a Johnstown, Pa.,television station that Sandusky "has maintained his innocence"after being awareof the allegations for more than three years.Sandusky, 67, was charged, among other crimes, with seven counts of involuntarydeviate sexual intercourse, eight counts of corruption of minors, eight countsof endangering the welfare of a child and seven counts of indecent assault. Thegrand jury report says he met most of the boys through his Second Milefoundation, which helps at-risk children. He was arraigned and released on$100,000 bail on Saturday."I knew him the way I knew him; he was always someone I admired, respected andlooked up to," LaVar Arrington, who played for Sandusky in the late 1990s at theuniversity nicknamed "Linebacker U," said by telephone Saturday afternoon. "Hisfoundation has helped tons of kids."But the former Redskins Pro Bowler and Penn State all-American linebacker, whois a contributor to washingtonpost.com, also added: "I'm not declaring anything.I'm neutral right now.""Because I am also a father and because the thought of one of my kids cominghome and saying something bad happened to them like that, I can't even thinkabout it. I don't want to discount the stories of the families and theirchildren. Innocent or guilty, he's tarnished himself by this. I'm verydisappointed it's actually even a possibility."According to the attorney general's office, in 2002 a graduate student assistantwent to Paterno's home the day after he saw Sandusky sexually assaulting a boyin the shower late at night at Lasch Football Building on the Penn State campus.Paterno told Curley the next day.About 10 days after the incident, Curley and Schultz met with the graduateassistant who had witnessed the abuse. Their executive action, according to thegrand jury report: They told Sandusky that he could not bring any children fromhis foundation into the football building any more.No one from Penn State - not Paterno, not the human neckties, no one - everreported the alleged incident to law enforcement, which the grand jury reportsays is required under Pennsylvania lawIn Warped Sports World, the don't-ask, don't-tell, sweep-it-clean behavior isrationalized as loyalty, having your coach's or teammate's back, moving on fromthe problem. It's seen as a noble quality, putting the team's needs - theuniversity's needs - before your own.Certainly it can be argued that Paterno and Penn State would have beenirrevocably hurt if these allegations had surfaced in a police report almost 10years ago; a program whose legendary defensive coordinator was accused of beinga pedophile would lose recruits and, by association, money and prestige. Whowouldn't want that to go away?But more unconscionable, if true: putting loyalty to the many, the program, infront of the victimization of even the one, a child.They were kids. Boys. Some no older than 8 years old when they were allegedlyabused by Sandusky between the years of 1994 and 2009, are now in their 20s,scarred forever by an adult they trusted. One testified under oath he hid interror in Sandusky's basement each time the coach came down the stairs.For those who observed or were told about possible sexual abuse, never tellinganyone beyond school officials is not merely an omission.And if the grand jury's report is right, the man with the most victories in thehistory of big-time college football knew.Paterno and university officials knew they hadn't employed a defensivecoordinator; they had in effect empowered a sexual predator, who the report saysspent the next seven years molesting more boys.And because they possibly chose to protect Penn State's brand instead of a child-  a 10-year-old kid whom they never even bothered to find out the name of,according to the grand jury report -  more children might have suffered becauseof their silence.If the grand jury report is true, they all need to step down - even the greatJoe Pa. It's the least he could do.For however long shame and guilt hover over his last days at Penn State it willnever outlast the shame and guilt felt by those young boys. Nor will it bringback their innocence. Like the sheen of Joe Pa's program, that may well be goneforever.wisem@washpost.com
