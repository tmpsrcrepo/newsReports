As with "The Tin Drum," Volker SchlÃ¶ndorff's surreally allegorical 1979 filmbased on GÃ¼nter Grass's book about a strangely ageless German boy, it's hard tointerpret the events depicted in "The Notebook" - another book making the leapto the big screen - as anything other than metaphors. But for what, it's notentirely clear. This adaptation of Agota Kristof's 1986 novel is impossible totake literally, yet too obscure to read between the lines.On the most superficial level, the film shows how war hardens the human heart.Set in Hungary during the final months of World War II, "The Notebook" centerson twin boys (played by real-life brothers AndrÃ¡s and LÃ¡szlÃ³ GyémÃ¡nt) whobecome twisted into sociopaths by their experience of brutality. After beingleft by their mother (GyÃ¶ngyvér BognÃ¡r) with their grandmother (PiroskaMolnÃ¡r), an abusive alcoholic who lives in a hovel near a German concentrationcamp, the children gradually turn into monsters.The boys beat each other with belts and hurl insults at each other, hoping toinure themselves to physical pain and insult. They forgo food, roll in the snowand walk in the open during air raids in an attempt to become impervious tohunger, cold and fear.At first, these seem like understandable reactions to abandonment, compounded bythe mistreatment they receive at the hands of the grandmother, who smacks themaround, treats them like slave labor, withholds food and steals care packagesmailed to them by their mother. The old woman is a thoroughly nasty person, andit's no wonder that she's known to the locals as the "witch."But the boys quickly begin to evince behavior that goes well beyond what onemight expect from children in similar straits. They compulsively kill insectsand then - in a shocking and, quite frankly, implausible series of escalations -do much, much worse. Most bizarrely, they befriend both the Nazi commander ofthe concentration camp (Ulrich Thomsen), a creepy pedophile who admires theirSpartan regimen, and a kindly old Jewish shoemaker (JÃ¡nos Derzsi) who givesthem free boots.To all appearances, they are motivated neither by ideology nor human feeling.Rather, their actions seem dictated by the necessities of the fiction, the pointof which is never clear.It would be unfair to expect verisimilitude from a tale like this. Like Oskarfrom "The Tin Drum," the unnamed twins - who are only ever referred to as"bastard" by their grandmother - aren't real people so much as, I don't know,manifestations of the schizoid post-war Hungarian national psyche, or something.Inseparable throughout the film, they agree to do something at the end of themovie that is utterly preposterous, even given the bizarre occurrences that havealready taken place. (As in "Drum," there is a scene of sex with an older womanthat seems a gratuitous attempt to shock, as well as other odd episodes thatlend "The Notebook" the flavor of magic realism.) Yet the ending is not justbizarre, but emotionally unsupported. That would be fine, if only I could figureout what all this was meant to stand for.michael.osullivan@washpost.comR.
