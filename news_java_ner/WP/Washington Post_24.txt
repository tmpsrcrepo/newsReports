Jameis Winston is the embodiment of the big-time college athlete who can dowhatever he damn well pleases as long as he remains the greatest economic engineon campus.Jimbo Fisher is the embodiment of the big-time college coach who is not really aleader of men but actually a follower of arrested locker-room development.Florida State football and Tallahassee law enforcement are the embodiment of howathletic revenue transforms universities into institutions of higher corruption.You can't follow the two-year odyssey of Winston and come away with any otherconclusion: Heisman trophies and national championships give superior athletesimmunity from real-life consequences for their actions.This learned culture of entitlement bleeds down from the NFL and Ray Rice,through the Florida panhandle and then trickles all the way to the high schoollevel in Sayreville, N.J. That's where seven adolescent boys were arrested lastFriday on charges stemming from sick hazing rituals that allegedly involved thesodomizing of "teammates" - and where some parents and coaches couldn't believethey canceled the rest of the varsity football season because (horrors) theBombers' streak of 20 straight postseason appearances would end.This is the part of Football in America that gets edited out. This is our newnational pastime.Winston will start at quarterback for Florida State in college football's gameof the week against Notre Dame on Saturday night. I predict he will start theremainder of his team's games this season, too, because no FSU complianceofficer interested in further employment with the university would declareWinston ineligible while investigating the sophomore star for the latestallegation against him: swapping autographs for cash.In further evidence of the game's twisted values, this claim may be the mostserious yet - because criminal behavior toward women and irresponsible prankssuch as firing BB guns on campus or stealing food from a supermarket isconsidered nothing compared to trying to profit personally off your own exploitsthat generate millions of dollars for others. Now that's criminal, son.Fisher says Famous Jameis is innocent, and except when he and the school arepublicly embarrassed into taking action, Fisher always says Famous Jameis isinnocent - whether he's being accused of trying to make a little coin on theside or something far more serious, such as last year's sexual assaultinvestigation.Winston could join ISIS and contract Ebola tomorrow, and you feel like Fisherwould tell you he was trying on a Halloween costume and had a sore throat beforesending him out to take on the Fighting Irish.The coach, who has lost just 10 times in 41 / 2 years and is 4-0 in bowl gamesafter replacing the legendary but hardly saintly Bobby Bowden, oversees aprogram with at least nine players arrested in the past three years on chargesfrom sexual assault to being an accessory to a fatal shooting, the New YorkTimes reported last week.Fisher's continued support shows he needs Winston more than Winston needs him.Florida State and Tallahassee need Winston more than he needs them. Never wasthat imbalance of power and leverage more clear than last season beforeprosecutors decided to drop a rape investigation against Winston, deciding therewasn't enough evidence to bring charges.Fact: The athletic department made sure Winston's attorney had the investigationreport before the state attorney did. By the time the state prosecutor's officegot it, Winston's attorney got copycat affidavits from his roommates to say thesex was consensual. His defense was set before the proper authorities even knewof the case.Fact: The investigating officer, Scott Angulo, has done private security workfor the Seminole Boosters, a nonprofit claiming, oh, $150 million in assets, theNew York Times reported last spring. Seminole Boosters is the main financialpipeline to Florida State athletics.The lawyer for Winston's accuser said the investigating officer who handled thecase told her that her client would be "raked over the coals" if she wentforward with the case - because down there in the panhandle, they take crackinghelmets seriously.The entire affair - Winston's entire college career, really - shows how thesystem failed everyone, how star athletes are inoculated from repercussions fortheir actions at the cost of the institutions they represent. And it's the samecorrosion afflicting the NFL and a high school football powerhouse in NewJersey.Here's a window into what Winston learned from that investgation: A month or soafter prosecutors decided not to charge him, he and a teammate posted anInstagram video of themselves singing a verse from a rap song called "On theFloor." It's about men who proceed after hearing the word "No" from women.Sample lyric: "She said she wants to take it slow. I'm not that type of guy I'llletcha know. When I see that red light all I know is go."I don't know whether Winston sexually assaulted a woman or the sex wasconsensual. No one knows but the people in that room.I do know that, through their handling of the investigation, Tallahassee policeand the university made it all but impossible to find out.I do know for all of Jameis Winston's rotten decision-making off the field, hedid make one important one as an 18-year-old that propelled him toward the NFLyet prevented him from genuine human development: He decided to play football atFlorida State, where he would never be told no - and if even he was, no onewould ever find out about it.mike.wise@washpost.comFor more by Mike Wise, visit washingtonpost.com/wise.
