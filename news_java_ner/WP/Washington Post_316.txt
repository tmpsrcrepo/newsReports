British  actress Kate Winslet won the Golden Globe Sunday for best supportingactress as the gala show, dubbed Hollywood's biggest party, got rolling in thefirst major awards show of this Oscar season.A breathless Winslet, who played a German woman with a hidden past in "TheReader," said she was "shocked" at her victory and added, "I have a habit of notwinning things."She thanked her co-stars and acknowledged the work of the other nominees,including Penelope Cruz, who had been picked as Winslet's key competitor for herpart as a freewheeling artist in the Woody Allen movie "Vicky CristinaBarcelona."The awards are closely watched for their star power and impact on the race forOscars, the world's top movie awards. But last year's Golden Globes morphed froma glitzy ceremony into a boring news conference due to a screenwriters strike.This year, however, the gala event given by the Hollywood Foreign PressAssociation went as planned with the likes of Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, BradPitt and Angelina Jolie joining in the red carpet fashion parade outside theceremony.The association was scheduled to hand out top honors for best film drama andcomedy, as well as actor and actress. (The show ended too late for full coveragein this edition; for more results, go to washingtonpost.com.) The roughly 90members of the association also give awards for television, but because theGolden Globes are held about a month before the Oscars, they are closelyfollowed for film.In that arena, tension couldn't be higher, industry pundits say, because many ofthe races are simply too close to call."There's no absolute shoo-in at the Globes this year, not even Heath Ledger,"said Tom O'Neil of the Los Angeles Times award-watching site, TheEnvelope.com.Ledger, who portrayed the villainous Joker in the Batman movie "The Dark Knight"and is nominated for supporting actor, died last year of an accidentalprescription drug overdose.In the race for best film drama, the top Golden Globe award, pundits gave"Slumdog Millionaire," about a young Indian man competing for love and money ona TV game show, the best shot at beating "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"an epic love story starring Pitt as a man who ages backward.But the experts cautioned people to not ignore "Frost/Nixon," which recountsinterviews of disgraced former  president Richard Nixon by British TV host DavidFrost. The other two nominees were dramas "The Reader" and "Revolutionary Road."Among dramatic actress nominees, Anne Hathaway as a recovering drug addict in"Rachel Getting Married" was up against Meryl Streep, playing a nun who suspectschild sex abuse in her Catholic school in "Doubt."But they faced strong challenges by Angelina Jolie in "The Changeling," KateWinslet for "Revolutionary Road" and Kristin Scott Thomas for the French film"I've Loved You So Long."The dramatic actor race pitted veteran Frank Langella, playing the formerpresident in "Frost/Nixon," against Sean Penn as slain gay activist Harvey Milkin "Milk," Pitt in "Benjamin Button," comeback kid Mickey Rourke for "TheWrestler" and DiCaprio as a frustrated husband in "Revolutionary Road."
