Under legendary coach Joe Paterno, Penn State football became one of the mostrecognizable and successful brand names in college athletics. But on Monday, theNCAA levied _blankunprecedented sanctions against the program for its role inthe sexual abuse scandal involving former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky,erasing part of the team's illustrious history and making its prospects in thenear future increasingly dim.The NCAA fined the school $60 million, imposed a four-year postseason ban onPenn State football, significantly reduced the number of scholarship players theteam can field over the next four years, placed the program on probation forfive years and enabled any current or incoming player to transfer and playimmediately without restriction.But perhaps the most significant individual sanction in the context of collegefootball history is that all of Penn State's wins from 1998 to 2011 have beenvacated, which means that Paterno, who oversaw the Nittany Lions' footballprogram for nearly 46 years, _blankno longer is the all-time winningest coach incollege football's Division I. That distinction  now returns to the late EddieRobinson, who recorded 408 career wins in 45 years as the head coach ofGrambling State - a number surpassed by Paterno on Oct. 29, his last game asPenn State coach before he was forced to step down.The punishment was not the so-called "death penalty," a drastic measure banninga rule-breaking program from competition that has been imposed only once in themodern era - in 1987, the NCAA prohibited Southern Methodist from fielding afootball team for one season (and the school added a second year). But theimpact on Penn State football is likely to be similarly devastating.The $60 million fine dwarfs any levied by the NCAA in the past; the four-yearbowl ban will cost the school tens of millions of dollars; and the reduction to15 from 25 annual new scholarships, while not unprecedented in scale, willsignificantly handicap recruitment efforts, especially given the other negativefallout from the Sandusky scandal.Opposing football programs looking to take in Penn State castoffs may receive anunanticipated gift: The NCAA  is considering whether to allow them to do sowithout counting the former Nittany Lions players against their allotment of 85scholarship players.At many Division I athletic departments, football ranks supreme and, in somecases, the school's hierarchy is adjusted to reflect as much.That, NCAA President Mark Emmert concluded, was what took place at Penn Stateduring the years in which Sandusky was found to be abusing young boys, and thatwas exactly the sort of environment he hopes these sanctions will deter.While examining the case, Emmert said Monday, the NCAA "kept foremost in ourthoughts the tragic damage that has been done to the victims and their families.No matter what we do here today, there is no action we can take that will removetheir pain and anguish."But what we can do is impose sanctions that both reflect the magnitude of theseterrible acts and that also ensure that Penn State will rebuild an athleticculture that went horribly awry. Our goal is not to just be punitive, but tomake sure the university establishes an athletic culture and daily mind-set inwhich football will never again be placed ahead of educating, nurturing andprotecting young people."Earlier this month, former FBI director Louis J. Freeh released a report thatfound Paterno, in concert with three other top Penn State officials, had coveredup allegations of child sexual abuse made against Sandusky, a former assistantcoach on the football team, for 14 years.Paterno, who coached Penn State for nearly 46 years, was fired in November anddied in January at age 85.Last month, Sandusky was found guilty on 45 counts related to sexual abuse of 10boys over a 15-year period. He has yet to be sentenced, though the charges carrya minimum 60-year sentence and 442 years at maximum.Emmert said the Freeh report, which was commissioned by Penn State, "was vastlymore involved and thorough than any investigation we've ever conducted."Typically, the NCAA goes through a process that can span more than a year whenit has reason to believe violations of its rules have been committed. Thatprocess includes an NCAA investigation, the issuance of a notice of allegations,time for the accused school to respond, a Committee on Infractions hearing andtime for the committee to draw its findings. None of that took place in the caseof Penn State, and the school is not believed to have committed any violationsof NCAA regulations.Using immoral or criminal behavior as a means to justify sanctions constitutesnew territory for the NCAA."It's important to separate this from a traditional enforcement case. That's notwhat this was," Emmert said. "This was an action by the [NCAA] ExecutiveCommittee, exercising their authority and working with me to correct what wasseen as a horrifically egregious situation in collegiate athletics."Penn State has signed a consent decree and will not appeal the sanctions._blankIn an interview with the Centre Daily Times, Penn State President RodneyErickson said it agreed to the sanctions in order to avoid an NCAA deathpenalty.In regards to the $60 million fine - the equivalent of one year of gross revenuefor the Penn State football program - the NCAA gave the school five years tocomplete the payment and stipulated that the money cannot come from other PennState sports programs or from academics. The NCAA plans to put the money into anendowment that will aid victims of child sexual abuse._blankErickson said in a written statement that the money to pay the fine wouldnot come from tax money, tuition dollars or donations."Penn State accepts the penalties and corrective actions announced today by theNCAA," Erickson said in the statement. "With today's announcement and the actionit requires of us, the University takes a significant step forward."_blankIn a written statement, Penn State football Coach Bill O'Brien, Paterno'sreplacement, described the punishment as "a very harsh penalty" but said heremained committed to the team."I will do everything in my power to not only comply, but help guide theUniversity forward to become a national leader in ethics, compliance andoperational excellence," said O'Brien, who met with his players Monday,according to reports. "I knew when I accepted the position that there would betough times ahead. But I am committed for the long term to Penn State and ourstudent athletes."yandas@washpost.comMore college sports coverage:Hamilton: The NCAA's surprising muscleWise: Why are they still allowed to play?NCAA's sanctions against Penn StateFor players, questions about their own futuresACC coaches react to Penn State sanctionsOn Faith: A bomb instead of a scalpelhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/nationals-journal/post/jesus-flores-receiving-treatment-for-sore-back-sandy-leon-to-play/2012/07/22/gJQAjuzX2W_blog.htmlHard Hits: Time to fix thingshttp://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/hard-hits/post/penn-state-community-must-now-start-to-fix-what-went-wrong/2012/07/23/gJQADuqg4W_blog.htmlPoll: Weigh in on the penaltiesOn Leadership: O'Brien's tough roadVideo: NCAA hands down sanctionshttp://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/nationals-journal/post/jesus-flores-receiving-treatment-for-sore-back-sandy-leon-to-play/2012/07/22/gJQAjuzX2W_blog.htmlPaterno family: A 'panickedresponse'
