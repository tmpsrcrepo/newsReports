Mama Kardashian is getting her own talk show.Technically, Kris Jenner is getting a six-week tryout as a daytime host thissummer.NewsCorp.'s Fox TV stations division - and its syndication operation, TwentiethTelevision - said that Jenner would get a test run on select Fox-owned TVstations, of which Washington's WTTG is one (although the station's not sayingwhether it's among those selected)."Kris" will be pop-culture-driven, delivering to viewers a "daily jolt ofcelebrity guests, fashion and beauty trends, plus a mix of lifestyle topics,"Twentieth Television said Monday, clarifying that "Kris" would not be apolitical talk show, as you might have thought.Jenner would be the second Kardashian Klan member with a job at the corporation;daughter Khloe is "The X Factor" "Ko-host" best known for reading her cue cardsas if she's taking the eye exam at the DMV. "How Does It Feel?" is her trademarkquestion on the Simon Cowell-created singing competition - in fact, it's heronly question.The "Kris" announcement was made the same day that Twentieth TV announced it hadrenewed its syndicated celebrity newsmag "Dish Nation," but the company's lipsare still sealed as to the fate of its Ricki Lake talker, which has been thesubject of "to be plowed under" speculation.Twentieth TV exec VP Stephen Brown said Monday that he thinks Jenner's show willcomplement the operation's Wendy Williams and "Bethenny" Frankel talk shows -both of which also started as six-week test runs.At last, PBS gets SalingerPBS member station WNET has secured rights to the oft-delayed J.D. Salingerbio-doc, which will air as the 200th episode of PBS's "American Masters" series,debuting next January." 'American Masters' covers the finest artists this country has produced, fromErnest Hemingway to John Lennon, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Woody Allen. Salingeris an American master, and I wanted to see him in the company of those artists,"the project's director, Shane Salerno, told the Web site Deadline.com Monday.It's one of few "American Master" projects not generated in-house, and Salernoretains full ownership of the film.An earlier version of the project was finished years ago, but it never airedbecause the reclusive Salinger died, after which some of his friends andcolleagues who'd turned down interview requests changed their minds about goingforward, Deadline explained.Susan Lacy of "American Masters," now billed as an exec producer, said it is her"intellectual and emotional thrill" to snag the movie about the enigmatic authorfor her franchise's 200th broadcast.A pox on 'The View'And by "low grade fever," they mean "chicken pox."Barbara Walters, turns out, has the chicken pox, Whoopi Goldberg announcedMonday morning on Babs's daytime talker "The View."Walters has been MIA from the show for days. Last week, Goldberg told viewersthat owing to "a low-grade fever," Babs was being kept in the hospital. Babs washospitalized after she hit her head on the steps of the British Embassy inWashington during an inaugural party.Since then, ABC has learned that doctors have diagnosed Babs's elevatedtemperature as a case of chicken pox."You all know that she fell and cut her head 10 days ago, and then was running atemperature, but it turns out it is all the result of a delayed childhood,"Whoopi said."She'd never had [chicken pox] as a child. So now she's been told to rest, she'snot allowed any visitors - and we're telling you, Barbara, no scratching!"Whoopi added.Babs was transferred to a New York hospital late last week, ABC said Monday."I'm really sorry that I blamed it on Grey Goose vodka the other day," "TheView" colleague Joy Behar said of Babs's step stumble, adding: "This is what youget for interviewing Honey Boo Boo."More on 'SVU' and TysonJoyful Heart Foundation, which was founded by "Law & Order: SVU" star MariskaHargitay to aid sexual-abuse victims, has disassociated itself from the show'sdecision to employ convicted rapist Mike Tyson as a guest star."First and foremost, I want to say, 'We hear you,' " foundation CEO MaileZambuto said on the group's Web site. "We acknowledge and recognize that thiscasting decision may be confusing, triggering and perhaps even painful for somepeople - especially those who are survivors of violence and abuse."While acknowledging the foundation "would not exist if not for the show" - andthat in recent years the foundation has partnered with "SVU" on variouscampaigns - "it is not a part of any formal relationship," Zambuto said."We were not aware of this casting choice and we have formally expressed ourconcerns to the executives and producers at 'SVU,' " continued Zambuto, adding:"We are deeply sorry if this choice on the part of 'SVU' has, in any way, causedany hurt."That's an odd choice of words, given the clearly "hurt" comments attached tosome of the nearly 6,300 signatures - including some by sexual-abuse survivorsand fans of the show - on a Change.org-sponsored petition to try to persuade NBCand "L&O:SVU" to reconsider the casting.demoraesl@washpost.comTo read previous columns by Lisa de Moraes, go to washingtonpost.com/tvblog.
