How do you get a county named after you? Well, it helps if you're a noble -- ora hero. That's what I discovered when I looked into where our local names camefrom. I discovered a lot of other things, too.Howard CountyIt must be every army officer's secret desire to order a bayonet charge. Lt.Col. John Eager Howard got to do just that.Born in 1752, Howard was the son of a wealthy Baltimore County planter. He rosethrough the ranks of the Continental Army. At the Battle of Cowpens in SouthCarolina in 1781, Brig. Gen. Daniel Morgan's plan was to set up three lines ofAmerican soldiers to stop the advancing British. One line of militia volunteerswould squeeze off a few shots then fall back, revealing a second line ofmilitia. They would do the same, falling back to reveal the professionalsoldiers under Howard's command.The British were stunned by the fusillade, though after a misunderstood commandcaused Howard to call on his men to make an orderly retreat, they thought theyhad bested the Americans and gave chase. But Howard simply had his men march tohigher ground, turn and shoot, and then envelop the Redcoats in a bayonetcharge. The enemy was routed.His bravery earned Howard a silver medal from Congress. He went on to serve as adelegate to the Continental Congress, governor of Maryland and U.S. senator. Hedied in 1827.Montgomery CountyKilled in a raging snowstorm on New Year's Eve 1775, while leading an assault onBritish-held Quebec, the Irish-born Richard Montgomery became the country'sfirst national hero. At least 18 U.S. counties and towns are named for him.Prince George's CountyAn overweight, alcoholic asthmatic who never shed his thick Scandinavian accent,Prince George of Denmark didn't make much of an impression on those who met him.But he was extremely loyal to his wife, Britain's Queen Anne. "I am hermajesty's subject," he once said modestly.Anne Arundel CountyLady Anne Arundell (pronounced "aaron-dale," by the way) was only 13 when shemarried Cecil Calvert, the second Lord Baltimore and the fellow who founded thecolony of Maryland. It's unclear what happened to the last "L" in her name. Itprobably got lost somewhere around Route 50.Frederick CountyWhat can you say about a man accused of having his own harem, and who was thecentral character in a notorious London rape case? Why, you can say thatFrederick County is named after him. Frederick Calvert was the sixth and, as itturned out, last Lord Baltimore. In 1768 he was accused of "feloniouslyravishing" a milliner named Sarah Woodcock, after luring her to his Epsom estatewith the promise of work. Amazingly, Frederick was acquitted.Calvert CountyThe Sopranos have their waste disposal business. The Calverts had theircolony-running business. George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore (and aCatholic to boot), was the first of the Calvert clan to snag a piece of the NewWorld, when he was granted permission to start a colony by the British crown. Hedied before seeing the colony established in Maryland.Charles CountyCharles, the third Lord Baltimore, was the first to have the pleasure ofactually visiting Maryland. He arrived in 1661 at the age of 24. Charles busiedhimself with his colony's infrastructure -- overseeing the construction ofroads, courthouses, storage facilities for gunpowder and the like. It was underhis watch that slavery was made legal.St. Mary's CountyWe can't say for sure who this Southern Maryland county is named after. SinceMaryland began as a colony friendly to Catholics, most experts think it wasnamed after the mother of Jesus. Other sources suggest it was named after QueenMary I, also known as Mary Tudor.Washington, D.C.That's an easy one. The capital is named after our first president, GeorgeWashington, a onetime surveyor, a successful planter, a slave owner and theyoung nation's consummate soldier-politician. As for the District of Columbiaportion, that's named after the Italian who "discovered" the New World:Christopher Columbus, who, it is said, sunburned easily.Julia Feldmeier helped research this essay.
