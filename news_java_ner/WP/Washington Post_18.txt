TAMPA - As Republican officials continue their attempts to persuade Rep. ToddAkin of Missouri to end his bid for the Senate over his comments about rape andabortion, GOP leaders adopted a party platform on Tuesday thathttp://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-platform-committee-begins-debate-on-party-manifesto/2012/08/20/1ff921a8-ea68-11e1-a80b-9f898562d010_story.htmlcalls for a constitutional amendmentprotecting "human life" but does not say whether exceptions should be allowed incases of rape and incest.According to a plank adopted by a 112-member Republican committee meeting here,an "unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life that cannot beinfringed." The platform also calls for legislation recognizing the rights ofunborn children under the 14th Amendment.That language would appear to be incompatible with exceptions when pregnanciesresult from rape or incest. But the draft does not specifically address theissue of exceptions, and party leaders here said that the issue is too complexto be addressed in what is intended to be a broad statement of party principle,and that it should be left up to states in a federal system."We have a general plank in there that affirms our belief in the God-given rightto life and that governments are instituted to protect that," said Virginia Gov.Robert F. McDonnell, chairman of the platform committee. "The specifics arelargely left up to the states."He added that the platform is intended to be a timeless document that should notbe influenced by current events about "who said what." He said, however, that hedisagrees with Akin's sentiments. "Those remarks do not reflect my views, or, Ithink, the views of this platform committee," he said.Akin has apologized for saying in a weekend television interview that pregnancyrarely results from "legitimate rape." But he has not backed off the broaderpoint he was making - that he is opposed to allowing abortions in cases of rapebecause it results in "harming another innocent victim."The Democratic National Committee quickly accused the GOP of adding an "Akinplank" to the platform, and Mitt Romney's campaign quickly noted that it is notunusual for the nominee to differ with some parts of the official partyplatform.Romney has said he believes that abortion should be illegal but that exceptionsshould be allowed in cases of rape and incest."It's not at all uncommon to have slight differences between the platform andthe nominee," said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Romney's running mate, Rep.Paul Ryan (Wis.).The platform includes some new language on abortion for the GOP, including acall for legislation to "ban sex-selective abortion" and "to protect fromabortion unborn children who are capable of feeling pain."It also offers a "salute" to states that have adopted mandatory waiting periods,new regulations for clinics that perform abortions and informed-consent laws - anod to states such as Virginia that have passed laws requiring ultrasound examsbefore abortions.Although Republicans are generally united in their opposition to abortion, thereis division over whether the practice should be allowed in some extreme cases ifthe nation's laws were changed.Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council and adelegate from Louisiana, said he believed the platform broke "no new ground" onabortion.He said that while he and other members of his group agree that abortion shouldnot be allowed even in cases of rape, the platform states "broad policypositions. They've left it to Congress to work on the specifics."The platform was approved late Tuesday after a marathon 48 hours of work. Itwill be adopted by the rest of the party shortly after the opening of theRepublican National Convention here on Monday.The platform agreed to Tuesday also includes language endorsing traditionalmarriage as the best environment for raising children and calls for aconstitutional amendment that would prohibit same-sex marriage.But it does not include a specific reference to reinstating the "don't ask,don't tell" ban against gay men and lesbians serving openly in the military.Instead, it merely says that the party "rejects the use of the military as aplatform for social experimentation."The draft includes planks designed to represent the views of tea partyactivists, with their focus on fiscal and debt issues, and supporters of Rep.Ron Paul (R-Tex.).One plank calls for an audit of the Federal Reserve, a priority for many Paulsupporters. Another would endorse a study of the feasibility of returning to thegold standard.Yet another would add a constitutional amendment requiring the vote of asupermajority of Congress to raise taxes, except in times of war or nationalemergency.Also, the platform endorses turning Medicaid into a block grant to the statesand shifting Medicare to a premium-support model, in which seniors in the futureare given a subsidy with which to purchase a private health insurance plan.heldermanr@washpost.com
