How do you get a county named after you? Well, it helps if you're a noble -- ora hero. That's what I discovered when I looked into where our local names camefrom. I discovered a lot of other things, too.Montgomery CountyIt would have been hard for Richard Montgomery to visit every place in theUnited States named after him. First of all, there are a lot of them, at least18 counties and towns. Second of all, he was dead.If he hadn't have been dead, those places probably wouldn't have been namedafter him. Such are the harsh terms that fame extracts.Born in Ireland in 1736, Montgomery served in the British Army, seeing ampleaction in the Americas. In 1772 he resigned his commission and moved to NewYork. There he married an American and, as the clouds of war gathered, joinedthe Continental Army as a brigadier general.He was killed in a raging snowstorm on New Year's Eve 1775, while leading anassault on British-held Quebec. The grief was instantaneous and Montgomery, thehighest ranking officer to be killed in the war, became one of the country'sfirst national hero.Frederick CountyWhat can you say about a man accused of having his own harem, and who was thecentral character in a notorious London rape case? Why, you can say thatFrederick County is named after him. Frederick Calvert was the sixth and, as itturned out, last Lord Baltimore. In 1768 he was accused of "feloniouslyravishing" a milliner named Sarah Woodcock, after luring her to his Epsom estatewith the promise of work. Amazingly, Frederick was acquitted.Prince George's CountyAn overweight, alcoholic asthmatic who never shed his thick Scandinavian accent,Prince George of Denmark didn't make much of an impression on those who met him.But he was extremely loyal to his wife, Britain's Queen Anne. "I am hermajesty's subject," he once said modestly.Howard CountyLt. Col. John Eager Howard was the son of a wealthy Baltimore County planter whorose through the ranks of the Continental Army. At the Battle of Cowpens inSouth Carolina in 1781, he ordered his men to make a bayonet charge that routedthe enemy. His bravery earned Howard a silver medal from Congress. He went on toserve as a delegate to the Continental Congress, governor of Maryland and U.S.senator.Anne Arundel CountyLady Anne Arundell (pronounced "aaron-dale," by the way) was only 13 years oldwhen she married Cecil Calvert, the second Lord Baltimore and the fellow whofounded the colony of Maryland. It's unclear what happened to the last "L" inher name. It probably got lost somewhere around Route 50.Calvert CountyThe Sopranos have their waste disposal business. The Calverts had theircolony-running business. George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore (and aCatholic to boot), was the first of the Calvert clan to snag a piece of the NewWorld, when he was granted permission to start a colony by the British crown. Hedied before seeing the colony established in Maryland.Charles CountyCharles Calvert, the third Lord Baltimore, was the first to have the pleasure ofactually visiting Maryland. He arrived in 1661 at age 24. Charles busied himselfwith his colony's infrastructure -- overseeing the construction of roads,courthouses, storage facilities for gunpowder and the like. It was under hiswatch that slavery was made legal.St. Mary's CountyWe can't say for sure whom this Southern Maryland county was named after. SinceMaryland began as a colony friendly to Catholics, most experts think it wasnamed after the mother of Jesus. Other sources suggest it was named after QueenMary I, also known as Mary Tudor.Washington, D.C.That's an easy one. The capital is named after our first president, GeorgeWashington, a onetime surveyor, a successful planter, a slave owner and theyoung nation's consummate soldier-politician. As for the "District of Columbia"portion, that's named after the Italian who "discovered" the New World:Christopher Columbus, who, it is said, sunburned easily.Julia Feldmeier helped research this essay.
