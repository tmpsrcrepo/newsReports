One of the most indelible moments in "The Hurt Locker" was a scene in which abomb technician played by Jeremy Renner returned from Iraq to his American hometown, where he visited a supermarket cereal aisle. Paralyzed by the sheervastness of it, he stood there staring, utterly dislocated and alienated fromthe culture he'd so recently risked his life defending.Writer-director Claudia Myers has made an entire movie of that moment with "FortBliss," an absorbing, uncannily on-point portrait of an Army medic navigatingthe transition from her high-stakes job - including two tours in Afghanistan -to a complicated domestic life.Gracefully portrayed by Michelle Monaghan in an impressive breakout performance,Maggie Swann is tough, smart and coolly competent, even when removing a piece oflive ammunition from a soldier's abdomen. But when she returns to Fort Bliss -the El Paso military base that plays itself here - she doesn't get the hero'swelcome of her peers. Instead, her resentful ex-husband, played by RonLivingston, delivers an awkward hug hello before taking her to reunite withtheir 5-year-old son, Paul, who sees Maggie as little more than a stranger.Myers has discovered a phenomenally gifted young actor named Oakes Fegley toplay Paul, who breaks into an enraged tantrum when Maggie takes him to live withher. But even though the beleaguered Maggie is a sympathetic figure, she's farfrom perfect: She clumsily mishandles her reunification with the little boy,using her most intimidating command presence to bully him into compliance.Myers, a Washington-based filmmaker who has worked extensively with the militarymaking documentaries and interactive videos, has clearly done her homework,seeding "Fort Bliss" with vivid details of life on the base, from bleary-eyedarrivals at a day care facility while it's still nighttime to Maggie's inabilityto sleep in a normal bed. Her most observant flourishes are to be found in thebrief exchanges that illuminate the difficulties of service members returning to"a life that doesn't want you in it."In many ways, "Fort Bliss" plays like a dramatized version of "Soldier Girls,"Helen Thorpe's similarly sensitive chronicle of female National Guard membersand their wartime experiences. Like that book, "Fort Bliss" delves into theprofessionalism, pride and inescapable tensions that animate women's lives inthe military, including sexual harassment, here depicted with exceptionalnuance.At its core, though, "Fort Bliss" is less a war picture than a compassionate,deeply engaging portrayal of one woman's struggle with the age-old conundrum ofbalancing work and family. As much drama as there is to be found in Maggie'sflashbacks to wartime duty, as well as her incipient romance with a dreamymechanic (Manolo Cardona) and the specter of future redeployment, the mostgalvanizing moments center on the incremental steps she and Paul take towardmutual trust.It's not nation-building, but the stakes are just as high. In Myers's capablehands, and with a powerful, vanity-free performance by Monaghan, "Fort Bliss"joins "Coming Home" and "The Best Years of Our Lives" as a movie deeply in sync,not just with the military characters it depicts, but also with the civilianworld that awaits them with such confoundingly mixed messages.ann.hornaday@washpost.comÂ½Unrated.
