"Yeah, I mean, [former president Bill Clinton is] a predator, a sexual predator,basically. Repetitive - you know there's dozens, or at least half a dozen,public women who have come forward."- Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), in an interview with "The Steve Malzberg Show" onNewsMax TV, Feb. 5, 2014The Fact Checker does not quite perceive the strategic logic behind Sen. RandPaul's attacks on former president Bill Clinton as a "sexual predator." Is heputting Hillary Rodham Clinton on notice that this stuff is fair game if shedecides to run for president? Is he trying to dampen enthusiasm for theDemocrats' biggest fundraiser? Is he trying to say that Democrats are hypocritesin the "war on women"?That's for political pundits to decide. We are interested in his use of numbers.He first referenced "dozens" of women but then amended that to "at least a halfa dozen public women who have come forward."Is that really correct?The FactsPaul's office declined to answer questions about how the senator reached thiscount, which is unfortunate because there are some definitional issues.The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a sexual predator as "a person who hascommitted a sexually violent offense and especially one who is likely to commitmore sexual offenses." That's a pretty harsh claim, but in his variousinterviews, Paul appears to be placing Monica Lewinsky on the list of Clinton"victims."That was a consensual affair, but Paul appears to take umbrage with the factthat she was 22 when the affair started and Clinton was the boss. "Having sexwith an intern at the office is inappropriate by any standard," Paul toldNewsmax TV. On             C-SPAN's "Newsmakers" show, he described Clinton as"some kind of abusive boss that uses their position of authority to takeadvantage of a young woman - a perpetrator of that kind of sexual harassment."Paul's point is a bit muddled. On the one hand, he is using terms that suggesthe is talking only about women who were allegedly the subject of sexualviolence. But then he also cites women who became lovers when Clinton was in anexecutive position.Let's first compile a list of consensual liaisons admitted by the women inquestion:lGennifer Flowers.A model and actress whose claim of a long-term affair nearlywrecked Clinton's first run for the presidency in 1992. (Clinton denied herclaim at the time, but under oath in 1998 he acknowledged a sexual encounterwith her.)lMonica Lewinsky.Intern at the White House whose affair with Clinton fueledimpeachment charges.lDolly Kyle Browning.A high school friend who said in a sworn declaration thatshe had had a 22-year off-and-on sexual relationship with Clinton.lElizabeth Ward Gracen. A former Miss America who said she had a one-night standwith Clinton while he was governor - and she was married. She went public tospecifically deny reports that he had forced himself on her.Perhaps one could claim that Lewinsky and Gracen had relations when Clinton wasin a position of executive authority. But both clearly appear to be consensual.Now let's look at the list of women who came forward and alleged an unwantedsexual encounter:lPaula Jones.A former Arkansas state employee who alleged that in 1991 Clinton,while governor, propositioned her and exposed himself. She later filed a sexualharassment suit, and it was during a deposition in that suit that Clintoninitially denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky. Clinton in 1998 settledthe suit for $850,000, with no apology or admission of guilt. All but $200,000was directed to pay legal fees.lJuanita Broaddrick.The nursing home administrator emerged after the impeachmenttrial to allege that Clinton had raped her 21 years earlier. Clinton flatlydenied the claim, and there were inconsistencies in her story. No charges werebrought.lKathleen Willey.The former White House aide claimed that Clinton groped her inhis office in 1993, on the same day when her husband, facing embezzlementcharges, died in an apparent suicide. (Her story changed over time. During adeposition in the Paula Jones matter, she initially said that she had norecollection about whether Clinton kissed her and insisted he did not fondleher.) Clinton denied her account, and the independent prosecutor concluded that"there is insufficient evidence to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubtthat President Clinton's testimony regarding Kathleen Willey was false." Willeylater began to claim that Clinton had a hand in her husband's death, even thoughher husband left behind a suicide note.Note that there is a pattern with these claims. As political analyst KirstenPowers put it in a column for USA Today, "Paul surely knows that no court of lawever found Clinton guilty of the accusations."Peter Baker, in "The Breach," the definitive account of the impeachment saga,reported that House investigators later found in the files of the independentprosecutor that Jones's lawyers had collected the names of 21 women theysuspected had had a sexual relationship with Clinton. Baker described the filesas "wild allegations, sometimes based on nothing more than hearsay claims ofthird-party witnesses." Some of the allegations, involving a state employee anda babysitter, suggested unwelcome advances.But Paul can't possibly be citing claims concerning unnamed accusers. Whensexual harassment claims were made against GOP presidential hopeful Herman Cain,Paul dismissed them because the women refused to publicly identify themselves.He said such anonymous allegations should never have been the subject of a newsstory. "To libel someone's character and not put your name on it, I think isinappropriate and shouldn't be printed," he told the National Review.The Pinocchio TestUnder the most generous accounting, one can find just three women who publiclycame forward with claims of sexual assault, but none was ever proven in a courtof law. Paul apparently also includes Lewinsky on this list, although that isdebatable given that she was an adult and never claimed that she was sexuallyharassed. (Indeed, she testified that the affair started after she flashed herthong at the president.)Paul needs to get his facts straight, rather than cavalierly toss out claims of"dozens" or "half a dozen" women publicly claiming that Clinton was a sexualpredator. That's a serious charge to make, which Paul certainly recognizes givenhis defense of Cain. The number of public claims amounts to three - and thereare enough questions about each of those allegations to wonder why Paul isscreaming "sexual predator" in the first place.
