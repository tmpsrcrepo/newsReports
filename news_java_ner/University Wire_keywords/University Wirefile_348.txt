
 DNA evidence has recently linked serial rapist suspect Nathan A. Washington to another incident of rape that occurred in 1997 at a hotel in Waynesboro County, Va. Washington, 40, was arrested Aug. 13 and is facing six charges related to two attacks that took place in Charlottesville in 2002 and 2004. Officials are pursuing an additional DNA sample to further their investigation. According to Sgt. Kelly Walker of the Waynesboro Police Department, a search warrant will be obtained in order to procure more DNA samples from the suspect. It is unconfirmed when the warrant will be executed and whether Washington will be charged with the crime if a stronger DNA connection is established. Authorities have not confirmed whether Washington will be charged in this case. "Mr. Washington is our suspect, but the investigation is ongoing," Walker said. Charlottesville Police declined to give any specific details about this new evidence. According to an earlier press release from the Charlottesville Police department, seven sexual assault cases in the area, including the two for which Washington has been charged, have been linked to a single serial rapist. One of these attacks took place in 2000 at Lambeth Field. Of the seven crimes, all but one were committed at the victim's homes. (C) 2007 Cavalier Daily via U-WIRE
