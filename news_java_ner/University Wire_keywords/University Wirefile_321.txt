
 William Beebe is scheduled to enter a guilty plea at 8:30 a.m., according to Tuesday's Charlottesville, Va., Circuit Court docket. The details surrounding the charges to which Beebe is expected to plead guilty will be announced at the hearing, when the court is scheduled to officially accept the agreement struck between Beebe and the Commonwealth Attorney's office. Deputy Commonwealth's Attorney Claude V. Worrell, II said he could not disclose any specifics of the deal because the case is still pending. Beebe received two indictments last April forrape and penetration with an inanimate object in the sexual assault of Elizabeth Seccuro. A trial was scheduled to begin Nov. 27. The reported rape occurred in 1984 at the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity house and was reopened September 2005 when Beebe contacted Seccuro via e-mail and apologized for "harming" Seccuro as part of an Alcoholics Anonymous recovery program.
