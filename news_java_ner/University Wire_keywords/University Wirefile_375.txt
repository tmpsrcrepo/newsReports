
 For state crime reporting purposes, the Incident Based Reporting System used by the Virginia Department of State Police uses the term "forcible fondling" to include acts of aggravated sexual battery, sexual battery and attempted sexual battery. Aggravated sexual battery is an act that causes serious bodily or mental injury with the intent to sexually molest, arouse, or gratify. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the word "fondle" as "to stroke or caress lovingly or erotically." The verbs "stroke" and "caress" are defined in part by the application of gentle pressure. Not only is the phrase "forcibly fondle" an oxymoron, but the phrase is also seen by sexual assault advocates as a euphemism for statutory crimes that cause serious bodily harm. "Too many times UVA and the University police refer to very obvious instances of sexual assault or harassment using euphemisms such as forcible fondling or something else that lessens the severity of what actually took place," commented a user on Speak Up UVA}. "This attempt to diminish the seriousness of the incidents is insulting to victims and to our community as a whole. UVA needs to start seriously addressing the sexual assaults and rapes that happen on this campus, starting by using the correct vocabulary." While the use of the term "forcible fondling" is a state-wide practice, students at the University can call their respective legislators for change.
