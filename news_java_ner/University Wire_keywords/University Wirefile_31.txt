 The University Judiciary Committee passed a revised version of the
 Standards of Conduct, the 12 guidelines governing the behavior of University students, at their meeting last night. In February, UJC members began discussions and revisions concerning the Standards after a re-examination in the spring semester found that several actions were not included in the rules. The Standards last were revised in 1988. Under current Standards a student committing a sexual assault on the Corner would not be violating a Standard because the incident did not take place on Grounds, said Brian Hudack, vice chairman for first years. The new Standards include the stipulation "within the city of Charlottesville or Albemarle County" -- adding new jurisdiction for the Standards. The Committee also removed the word "intent" from both Standard 4--which prohibits disruption in classrooms--and Standard 11--which prevents breaching confidentiality in "Judiciary Committee, the Honor Committee or any other University agency or special status organizations." UJC Judge Marshall Sheifman said taking the word intent out of those rules allowed students to initiate cases in which premeditation is not present. Committee Chairwoman Amanda Morrow endorsed the revision, noting that a section in judiciary trials is dedicated to determining whether a student intended to commit the violation. "Only two of the rules mentioned intent. Either they all should or none of them should mention intent," Hudack said. The revised Standards passed by a majority vote of 11 to 5. The Committee hopes to present the revised Standards to University President John T. Casteen III and to William W. Harmon , vice president for student affairs, for feedback by December. The Board of Visitors must approve the revised Standards before they can go into effect. Hudack said he hopes the revised Standards will be in place by the spring semester.
