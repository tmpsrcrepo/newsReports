 After returning home to good old C-ville after attending the National
 Student Conference on Campus Sexual Violence over the weekend, you can imagine my reaction to hear, upon my return, that two sexual assaults (one of which was apparently determined false) had occurred here at the University. Ironically enough after such a tragic weekend, Playboy came to the University to recruit prospective "playmates" for their upcoming issue featuring women of the ACC. I always have been an advocate of free speech and publication, but over the weekend I really got an eye opener to the extremely negative effects that pornography has on our society. Many argue these women get paid a lot of money and participate voluntarily. That, however, is not what really concerns me. In many instances of sexual assault, the men don't see women as human beings but as objects to mutilate. This idea may not come directly from pornographic magazines but such publications certainly don't discourage it. These magazines are filled with images of women in unrealistic and often dehumanizing conditions. Many times these images and fantasies are even acted out in rapes. Sexual assault affects women predominantly. It only will be diminished or stopped when men start realizing that we are not just objects available and at their disposal. At an institution that promotes equality among all students, one would think that we as a school would not even want to be associated with something so demeaning to women that gives men such negative ideas about who women really are.
