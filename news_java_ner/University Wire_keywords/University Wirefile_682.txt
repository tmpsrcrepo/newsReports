
 To the University of Virginia, Over the last year our community has faced tragedy, trial and emotional turmoil. Through these tribulations One in Four has continued to stand with all students, especially those affected by sexual violence. Today's suspension of the investigation into a 2012 incident at the Phi Kappa Psi house does not represent the end of our fight against sexual violence on college campuses, nor does it indicate a wavering commitment by members of this community to support survivors. As awareness continues to remain at an all-time high, we will continue to recommit ourselves to making this University a safer community. We know from supporting our loved ones and listening to our peers that sexual assault harms far too many members of our community. Therefore, our work to create cultural and institutional change has only just begun, and our mission to educate and empower will never slow or cease. Sexual assault must end. We applaud Police Chief Tim Longo and his staff for working carefully and deliberately. We too will proceed deliberately as advocates on this issue, aiming to make U.Va. a safe space for survivors to come forward without fear. We are dedicated to making the University of Virginia a leader in the ongoing fight against rape and sexual assault. Please join us as we move forward. One in Four University of Virginia
