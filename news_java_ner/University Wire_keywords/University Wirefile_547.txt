
 Cavalier Daily Charlottesville resident Jesse Matthew will go before a Charlottesville General District Court judge on Mar. 26 to face the class-two felony charge of abduction with intent to defile in connection with the death of second-year College student Hannah Graham. Originally scheduled for Oct. 2, Matthew's court date was first rescheduled to Dec. 4 before being pushed back to Marsh. Matthew's attorney, Jim Camblos, said in October the original continuance was met by mutual agreement. Court records list the offense date as Sept. 13 - the night Graham first went missing. Matthew was arrested in Galveston, Texas Sept. 26. Graham's body was found Oct. 18, abandoned on a property about 11 miles from the University. Despite this discovery, Charlottesville Police Captain Gary Pleasants said no charges against Matthew have been added or altered as of yet. Matthew has also been charged and is awaiting trial for rape, abduction and attempted murder in a 2009 case in Fairfax County.
