 University Police are investigating two assaults involving female
 University students that occurred over the weekend. University Police Sgt. Thomas Durrer said two males sexually assaulted a female student Friday night between 8:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. near the Albert H. Small Building in the Engineering School. Durrer said one of the males held her down while the other sexually assaulted her. He said the student was sent to the hospital and released. Police officials described the sexual assaulter as a black male between 25 to 35 years old with no facial hair. He was wearing a black sweatshirt zipped up with the hood pulled over his head. He was wearing leather gloves and dark or black jeans. No suspects have been found, and the assault is still under investigation, Durrer said. University Police also are investigating the assault of a student in a bathroom of Cauthen House Thursday night. Durrer said the student reported the assault at about 9:30 p.m. The student was taken to the hospital and subsequently released. No suspects have been found, but police are still investigating and asking residents for information. Police officers are continuing to patrol the dorm area. "I feel safer now that there's a little more security around," said Sylvia Yam, a first-year student and Cauthen resident. "But I never thought it was a problem before because we have Crypto-Cards" to open the doors to the dorm. Dean of Students Robert T. Canevari said he is concerned about the two crimes, especially because both occurred during the same weekend. "Am I concerned? -- Absolutely," Canevari said. "It's another reminder that we have to look out for one another." But he said that the crimes have not shattered his faith in the safety of the University community. "I still consider the University a safe place," he added. (C) 1999 Cavalier Daily via U-WIRE
