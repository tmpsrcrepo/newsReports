
 Law firm O'Melveny & Myers will serve as the new independent counsel to the Board of Visitors on issues of sexual violence at the University, the office of Attorney General Mark Herring informed University Rector George Martin in a letter Tuesday morning. The attorney general's office had previously announced that the independent counsel would be attorney Mark Filip. Filip was removed from his advisory position Friday morning due to prior affiliation with Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. "This situation is too serious to allow anything to undermine the confidence in the objectiveness and independence of this review," Herring said in a press release. In a statement regarding the appointment of O'Melveny & Myers, Herring said that the investigation will not only look at how the University addresses and adjudicates sexual assault, but also will examine how the school handled the specific case detailed in Rolling Stone. "Charlottesville Police have been asked to handle any criminal investigations into this specific attack, but all other aspects of campus sexual violence, including how school officials handled this case, will be thoroughly and independently scrutinized," Herring said. "I have made it clear this will be an aggressive and consequential investigation and review." According to the letter, sent to Martin by Chief Deputy Attorney General Cynthia Hudson, the team of attorneys from O'Melveny & Myers will include Walter Dellinger, Danielle Gray and Apalla Chopra. In addition to examining policies and procedures for preventing sexual violence and handling reports, the team is charged with examining larger systemic factors which may facilitate sexual violence on Grounds. "The team will assist the Board in determining what cultural and institutional changes must be made within the University community to make it clear that sexual violence will never be tolerated," Hudson said in the letter.
