 So much for nice guys finishing last.
 A committee of students and administrators at the University of Virginia announced Friday that it has named third-year College student Eric Dean Hutter as the next resident of the Lawn's Gus Blagden Room. Often referred to as the "good guy" room, 15 West Lawn is privately endowed in memory of Augustus Silliman "Gus" Blagden III, a 1963 College graduate recognized by his peers as an exceptionally warm and caring person. Blagden died of a congenital heart condition two years after graduating. To be considered for residence in the Blagden room, students must be nominated by their peers. As one of 41 nominees, Hutter said he was completely surprised to win the honor. "I was just astonished ... My first thought was to call and tell my mom," he said. A member of Resident Staff, the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps, Delta Sigma Phi fraternity and One in Four, the all-male sexual assault awareness group, Hutter has been involved in many facets of University life. Margaret Dumas, former Inter-Sorority Council president and selection committee member, said Hutter exemplifies the best qualities of the room's namesake. "We really felt that Eric is sort of the present-day Gus Blagden ... He has had such a huge impact on so many peoples' lives," Dumas said. Joshua Scott, current resident of the Gus Blagden Room and selection committee member, described Hutter as friendly and easygoing. He is "good-natured and fun to be around - a great guy who shows genuine concern for other people," Scott said. Hutter said he would like to know who nominated him for the honor. "In a way I wish I knew who had written the nomination - not because I received the award, but because they felt I was deserving of the award in the first place." (C) 2000 Cavalier Daily via U-WIRE
