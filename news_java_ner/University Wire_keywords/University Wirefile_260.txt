
 Charlottesville, Va., police arrested 26-year-old David Lee Long Jr. Thursday evening in connection with a string of peeping tom reports, according to a City Police press release. The most recent incident occurred Thursday morning. A 29-year-old female graduate University of Virginia student awoke to a male kneeling next to her bed, according to the release. Police have attributed three other incidents in the Cherry Avenue area during the past week to Long. According to the press release, the police have connected peeping incidents that occurred as far back as May of this year to Long. Long has a criminal history and is currently on probation. He has already been included in the state's DNA database, but has been eliminated as a suspect in the ongoing investigation surrounding the Charlottesville serial rapist. The recent peeping incidences have raised special concern at a time of year when student safety and awareness efforts already are heightened. "The university police always make it a point to pay special attention at the start of the school year because there are students new to the area and some that have never been on their own before," University Police Captain Michael Coleman said. "We have a strong interest in providing information to students in order to keep themselves safe." Coleman reiterated the importance of students walking in groups, locking doors and windows and attending information meetings held for first year students. (C) 2005 Cavalier Daily via U-WIRE
