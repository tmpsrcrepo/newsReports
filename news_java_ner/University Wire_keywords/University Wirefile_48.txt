 A man described as a male with sandy blond hair, between 20 and 24 years
 old, attacked a University student Saturday night behind Westminster Presbyterian Church. The assault comes almost a month after a man exhibiting similar characteristics raped a University student under Beta Bridge. According to the Charlottesville Police Department, the same man may have been responsible for both attacks. News that the police may have evidence to connect the crimes is positive. However, it is time the University community saw some results from this ongoing investigation, and the investigation looking into a series of attacks between March 17 and July 13, 1997. In light of the various incidents from the last year and a half, the University community--particularly in areas east of Grounds around Rugby Road--is vulnerable and simply not safe at any hour approaching darkness. The University has announced plans to begin its Student Escort service an hour earlier in the day. The Charlottesville Police Department, we hope, will also enhance its efforts and place the Rugby Road area under greater scrutiny. The latest assault has sparked a high level of anxiety at the University. To help ease some of this concern, and come closer to putting the one or many assailants behind bars, Charlottesville's Police Department needs to respond quickly with a new commitment to protecting the University's surrounding community.
