
 The Cavalier Daily Jesse Matthew's trial date for a 2005 sexual assault in Fairfax County was moved to June 8, following a hearing on Feb. 13. Matthew is facing charges for attempted murder, abduction and sexual assault of a woman walking home from a grocery store. The trial was originally set to begin in Fairfax County Circuit Court on March 9, but Matthew's defense attorney requested a delay to review all of the documents of the prosecution. In a separate case, Matthew was also recently charged with the first-degree murder of and abduction with intent to defile second-year College student Hannah Graham. He is currently being held in Fairfax County, but will appear in court in Albemarle County on Feb. 18 via live video feed.
