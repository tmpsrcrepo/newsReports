 Charlottesville resident Rudolph T. Johnson Jr. has been put on
 administrative leave by his employers at the University of Virginia Health System after he was arrested Tuesday for the suspected rape of a female patient. University Police Capt. Michael Coleman said the incident occurred at the Medical Center at about 1 a.m. Monday. Johnson was a patient care assistant at the Medical Center. Johnson has had a former drug conviction, said Nick Carter, the Health System's chief operating officer. Carter said the Health System runs crime checks routinely on all new hires and that it knew about the past drug conviction because Johnson had volunteered it on his application. However, Carter said the hospital had received a high recommendation during the application process from Johnson's probation officer and that officials made "what seemed at the time to be a thoughtful decision" to hire Johnson. "This situation is clearly disturbing, and we are deeply concerned for our patients and their families," said Carter. Carter said he has appointed Pam Cipriano, chief clinical officer, and Ron Bouchard, chief administrative officer, to examine all aspects of the unit's operation, including personnel and supervisory policies, to determine if there are any systemic policies or procedures that may have contributed to the incident. The Health System also has begun to offer counseling for any patients or family members who desire it in regard to the incident, Carter said. "We are all troubled by this situation, and I can assure you that we will not rest until we have taken every step possible to protect the safety of our patients," he said. Johnson appeared in Charlottesville District Court on Wednesday, where he was appointed a public defender and a preliminary hearing was set for June 21. Johnson now is being held without bond. If he is convicted of rape, he could face penalties ranging from a minimum five years in jail to a life sentence. (C) 2001 Cavalier Daily via U-WIRE
