 A 20-year old University student was raped in an apartment on University
 Circle Saturday by another student she had met at a party that night, police officials said. Charlottesville Police Sgt. Gary Pleasants said both students had been drinking at the party and then went to the apartment. Pleasants said the woman fell asleep and awoke at about 4 a.m. to find the man raping her. He said the woman does not remember giving consent. The Saturday night rape is not connected to recent reported sexual assaults in the Rugby Road area, police said. As of press time, no arrests had been made. Pleasants said although the police receive several reports of acquaintance rape a year, he believes similar incidents occur more often than they are reported. "I don't know how often this kind of thing actually happens," he said. But "it's not a very common thing for it to be reported." Sexual Assault Education Coordinator Claire Kaplan agreed that many victims of acquaintance rape do not report such incidents to the police. "I think it happens far more frequently than it is reported," Kaplan said. According to the Sexual Assault Education Office, 18 rapes and sexual assaults were reported in 1997. Kaplan said that although women can protect themselves by learning self-defense and staying clear of dangerous situations, there is no guarantee that a woman will be protected from acquaintance rape. "There is no way of being safe against rape," she said. "Even a woman who is very knowledgeable can be raped." (C) 1999 Cavalier Daily via U-WIRE
