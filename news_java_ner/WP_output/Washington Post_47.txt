<PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> 's university was founded in <DATE>1819</DATE> as an auspicious institution , an " academical village " surrounding a building modeled after the Roman Pantheonwith a strict honor code and a deep commitment to traditions and public service.This week ? 
The image linked to Mr. <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> 's <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> looks like it 's fromway back in our nation 's shameful history - a bloodied young African Americanman , thrown to the ground for a picayune alleged offense.That disturbing photo of <PERSON>Martese Johnson</PERSON> , the 20-year-old <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginiastudent</ORGANIZATION> who got turned away from an Irish pub at the end of <ORGANIZATION>St. Patrick</ORGANIZATION> 's Dayrevels , is another sign that something is seriously wrong in Charlottesville.Murderous love , epic power struggles , gang rapes/not-gang-rapes , kidnapping/killing and now , a bloody arrest for an alcohol infraction ? 
No otheruniversity in the nation is producing more sensation and scandal right now.On <DATE>Monday</DATE> , the school was front and center again as the <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> policeannounced that their investigators found no evidence of an alleged fraternitygang-rape described in Rolling Stone m agazine.The string of events at <LOCATION>U-Va</LOCATION> . 
sounds more like the season lineup for the BravoNetwork than news from a highly selective " public Ivy " where all students mustmemorize the code of honor , and many write this pledge on the top of everyassignment and exam : " On my honor , I pledge that I have neither given norreceived help on this assignment . 
" Traditions on " Grounds , " as the <DATE>U-Va</DATE> . 
campus is always called , matter a greatdeal - sometimes too much . 
The university did n't admit an African Americanstudent until <DATE>1950</DATE> - and that was after a lawsuit . 
And it was one of the lastpublic universities in the country to allow women to enroll freely . 
In <DATE>1970</DATE> , again , after legal action.There is something called the " <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> Curse . " 
And I did n't make thatup.It 's what the <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> Tar Heels called their gridiron losing streakagainst U-Va. , in a rivalry that dates back to an 1892 football game ( Virginiawon ) . 
But maybe it 's time to expand that idea beyond the football field , because one of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's finest and oldest universities is totally bedeviled.But wait , maybe football does have something to do with it . 
Because the TarHeels declared the curse broken <DATE>Oct. 16 , 2010</DATE> , when they beat the Cavaliers andbegan their five-year winning streak.That was not long after <DATE>U-Va</DATE> . 
's streak of dark and bizarre events got rolling.On <DATE>May 3 , 2010</DATE> , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> lacrosse player <PERSON>Yeardley Love</PERSON> was killed by heron-again , off-again boyfriend <PERSON>George Huguely</PERSON> , also a lacrosse player.After a sensational trial that sent Huguely to prison , the university ' sleadership provided the drama . 
University President <PERSON>Teresa A. Sullivan</PERSON> wasserved her walking papers after getting knifed by the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Visitors</ORGANIZATION> becauseshe was n't making the university flashy or cashy enough . 
Sullivan survived , but , whew , what a furor.This past year has been the worst of all . 
First , in <DATE>September</DATE> , 18-year-oldsophomore <PERSON>Hannah Graham</PERSON> went missing . 
A <DATE>month later</DATE> , her remains were found.Jesse <PERSON>L. Matthew Jr.</PERSON> , 33 , was arrested , and he was later linked to theinvestigation of another young woman 's killing - <PERSON>Morgan Harrington</PERSON> , 20 , aVirginia Tech student - who was last seen on <DATE>U-Va</DATE> . 
's campus in <DATE>2009</DATE> at aMetallica concert.And then Rolling Stone magazine published the story of " Jackie , " a student whosaid she was violently gang-raped at a fraternity party - a story that shockedthe nation and set off a wave of angst at <LOCATION>U-Va</LOCATION> . 
The story turned out to be false . 
But <ORGANIZATION>Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longosaid</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>Monday</DATE> that although there 's no evidence to support the gang-rapeallegation , they are n't closing the investigation . 
" It 's a disservice to <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> , " <PERSON>Longo</PERSON> told reporters at yet another televisednews conference about <DATE>U-Va</DATE> . 
He noted that there is no statute of limitations forsexual assault . 
And he said that just because the Rolling Stone article ' sversion of events is false , " that does n't mean something terrible did n't happento <PERSON>Jackie</PERSON> <TIME>that night</TIME> . 
" On top of all that ? 
The Cavaliers were knocked out of the basketball playoffsthis weekend , and The Post 's front page <DATE>Monday</DATE> had a most appropriate metaphorfor the state of Mr. <PERSON>Jefferson</PERSON> 's University : a photo of <DATE>U-Va</DATE> . 
players hangingtheir heads low.It 's time for <DATE>U-Va</DATE> . 
to break the curse plaguing it . 
Not by clinging totraditions that exclude or waxing nostalgic for the days when the university wasall-white and all-male . 
But rather , the university will flourish if it holds to its founding principles : honor , academic rigor , respect and integrity.You know , the stuff you do n't see on Bravo.Correction : An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that theuniversity has an iconic building modeled after the Parthenon.petula.dvorak@washpost.comTwitter: @petulad Ã¯ ...
