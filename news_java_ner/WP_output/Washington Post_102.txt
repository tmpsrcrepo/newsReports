Considering what a provocative figure <PERSON>Errol Flynn</PERSON> was , " The Last of <PERSON>Robin Hood</PERSON> " sure is dull . 
Even the subversive tale of <ORGANIZATION>Flynn</ORGANIZATION> 's final love affair - with a15-year-old girl in the late <DATE>1950s</DATE> - is n't enough to enliven the drama byco-writers and co-directors <PERSON>Richard Glatzer</PERSON> and Wash Westmoreland.At least the casting is great . 
A mustachioed <PERSON>Kevin Kline</PERSON> - with a dandifiedaccent and a habit of pantomimed swashbuckling - is a ringer for the 48-year-oldFlynn , and <PERSON>Susan Sarandon</PERSON> transforms herself for the role of a deranged stagemother . 
She plays <LOCATION>Florence Aadland</LOCATION> , who has transferred her dreams of fame ontoher daughter , <LOCATION>Beverly</LOCATION> ( Dakota Fanning ) , an ethereal girl with middling talentwho catches <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> 's eye as she 's heading to her job as a chorus girl on aHollywood movie set.The moment is nicely shot , showing <ORGANIZATION>Beverly</ORGANIZATION> 's reflection in a window as shebounces down the street in her youthful way . 
A quick shift of focus shows thatwe 're not the only ones watching <LOCATION>Beverly</LOCATION> ; <ORGANIZATION>Flynn</ORGANIZATION> is on the other side of thewindow , peering through the blinds.She 's seduced by <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> that evening during an " audition " at his house and isultimately charmed into becoming his girlfriend . 
Her mother naively believesthat <LOCATION>Beverly</LOCATION> is merely <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> 's protégée , but even when <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> finds out thetrue nature of the pair 's relationship , she does n't really discourage theaffair . 
Although <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> is basically washed up , <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> thinks he could be thefamily 's savior.In his defense , I suppose , <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> believes <LOCATION>Beverly</LOCATION> is 18 when they first meet.That 's still three decades his junior , but at least it 's legal . 
And yet , true tohis reputation as an insatiable lothario , uncovering her true age does not deterhim . 
In one of the film 's few funny moments , <LOCATION>Beverly</LOCATION> 's father calls the actor " awalking penis . 
" The movie briefly delves into a couple of charges of statutory rape lodgedagainst the former <PERSON>Robin Hood</PERSON> in the early <DATE>1940s</DATE> . 
( He was acquitted . ) 
Even ifBeverly had been aware of those charges , she might not have cared . 
She falls forFlynn , and in the process she becomes a pawn for both her mother and her lover.She makes the prematurely aged , vodka-pickled actor feel young and importantwhile keeping alive <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> 's hopes of stardom for her daughter.Beverly is a tragic figure , and <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> are n't the only ones whoobjectify her ; <PERSON>Glatzer</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Westmoreland</LOCATION> do as well , painting her as a hollowcharacter with no discernible personality . 
She mostly sits around lookingwide-eyed . 
The fact that <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> does n't really think of her as a person is badenough - he calls her Woodsy , short for " wood nymph , " after deeming her an " exquisite creature . " 
That the filmmakers do n't bother to give her character anycomplexity only adds to the ick factor.Ultimately the movie feels like an empty exercise . 
Sure , it 's a cautionary taleabout the pitfalls of fame . 
But when the one figure most worthy of our sympathyis nothing more than a beautiful blonde robot , what 's the point?stephanie.merry@washpost.comÂ½R .
