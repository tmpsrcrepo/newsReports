In <DATE>March</DATE> , county officials convened a task force on domestic violence . 
Theywere concerned about procedures and practices in county government in the wakeof the <DATE>March 11</DATE> death of <PERSON>Ernestine Dyson</PERSON> , 32 , of <LOCATION>Oxon Hill</LOCATION> , who was killed lessthan 24 hours after her estranged husband , <PERSON>Tyrone Dyson</PERSON> , who had a long historyof alleged violence against women , had promised in court to leave her alone.Tyrone <PERSON>Dyson</PERSON> , 32 , then killed himself.Excerpts of a recent report by the task force appear here . 
The entire report , made available to The Post electronically by the office of <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> 's <PERSON>AttorneyGlenn Ivey</PERSON> , a task force member , can be read at www.washingtonpost.com/princegeorges . 
. . . The task force was convened to develop an immediate plan of action toaddress domestic violence issues throughout county government . 
The final reportwas tentatively scheduled for completion by <DATE>May 1 , 2003</DATE> . . . . Domestic violence is a major social problem and a prevalent crime that crossesage , gender , ethnic , economic , educational , religious and social lines . 
It iscommonly understood as assaultive behavior that usually involves adults who arein an intimate , sexual and cohabiting relationship.However , because it is a crime encompassing all domestic relationships , manyprefer the term " family violence . " 
Referred to as the " Cycle of Violence , " domestic violence usually consists of repeated patterns of abusive behaviors.According to legal experts , domestic violence is the least reported crime in <LOCATION>theUnited States</LOCATION> . 
Often , based upon cultural , religious or traditional beliefs , many victims feel their spouse or partner has the right to abuse them . 
They maybelieve they must live with violence as an accepted way of family life . 
Othersfeel shame and guilt . 
Many victims are unaware of the services and protectionavailable to them . 
No one deserves to be abused , and the first step to resolvingan abusive relationship is to recognize that such violence is unacceptablebehavior.This responsibility ultimately rests , not with the victim , but with society . 
Ifwe are complacent about domestic violence and if we consider it someone else ' sproblem , then we are tolerating domestic violence and promoting the " code ofsilence . " 
Isolation within the " code of silence " allows domestic violence tothrive.The <ORGANIZATION>Department of Justice</ORGANIZATION> estimates that approximately <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> of domesticviolence assaults are actually reported to the police . 
Individual surveysgenerally produce higher estimates of violence than official records , but theyare also assumed to underestimate the actual extent of domestic violence.Reporting does not assure prosecution . 
A domestic violence victim may experiencefive or more incidents before deciding to leave or pursue prosecution withoutrecanting or asserting marital privilege ( <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> law allows one instance ofnot testifying against a spouse ) . 
Ending an abusive relationship is verydifficult . 
Most victims just want the abuse to stop.Often referred to as " intimate violence , " domestic violence or spousal abuse isdefined as physically or emotionally harmful acts between spouses or otherindividuals in intimate relationships . 
In legal terms , it includes violencebetween spouses , former spouses , persons with a child in common , and same sexpartners . 
Protection is extended to blood relatives and vulnerable adults.Violence is often pervasive in dating relationships , but does not qualify as " domestic " for services like protective orders . 
It is covered however , under thePeace Order statute.Abuse may include verbal or emotional abuse , denial of access to resources ormoney , restraint of normal activities ( including isolation from friends orfamily ) , sexual coercion or assault , threats to kill or harm , and physicalintimidation or attacks . 
In extreme cases , particularly if no interventionoccurs , domestic violence can result in the death of either partner . 
Murder byintimates accounts for about <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> of all homicides in the <LOCATION>United Stateseach</LOCATION> year . 
Victim homicides are most often the result of escalating violence , with the lethality rate increasing by <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> when a victim attempts to leavean abusive situation . 
But it is not unusual for male domestic homicides to bethe result of a domestic violence victim fighting back in self-defense or indefense of her children.Experts agree that domestic violence is a widespread problem whose actual extentis difficult to measure . 
In Prince <PERSON>George</PERSON> 's County , as on the state and nationallevel , the primary method of determining domestic violence rates is the use ofavailable statistics from the various responding agencies . 
Again , while we mustrely upon these statistics , we can not accept them as conclusive due tounderreporting by both males and females . 
Males , in fact , may be even morereluctant than females to report , although criminal charges for incidents ofmale abuse in <LOCATION>Prince George 's County</LOCATION> have increased to nearly <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> . 
Ifevery incident of abuse within the county were reported , the actual numberswould be much greater.Additionally , the use of different definitions and different modes of reportingamong agencies can affect the resulting statistics.For the period of <DATE>January</DATE> to <DATE>June of 2002</DATE> , using the special study code 29 forspousal abuse , the <ORGANIZATION>Prince George 's County Police Department Technical ServicesDivision</ORGANIZATION> reports that officers responded to 864 incidents . 
The Office of theState 's Attorney 's Domestic Violence Unit received 4,126 charging documents in2002 and 901 from <DATE>December 31 , 2002</DATE> through <DATE>March 2003</DATE> . 
One hundred andtwenty-one interim protective orders ( 24/7 order ) were issued by the <ORGANIZATION>Office</ORGANIZATION> ofthe Court Commissioner for the period ending <DATE>January 23 , 2003</DATE> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Office of theAdministrative Clerk for District Court</ORGANIZATION> reports 4,136 domestic violence filingsfor Fiscal Year <DATE>2002</DATE> , 367 for <DATE>January 2003</DATE> and 294 for <DATE>February 2003</DATE> . 
The Officeof the Sheriff reports an increase in service from 650 protective orders permonth since the inception of the 24/7 law , and currently project service of11 ,000 orders this year.For the period of <DATE>July 1 , 2001</DATE> to <DATE>June 30 , 2002</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Maryland Network AgainstDomestic Violence</ORGANIZATION> reports four Prince <PERSON>George</PERSON> 's County deaths resulting fromdomestic violence homicide . 
However , statistics for that period were difficultto verify and we suspect that number to be incorrect and likely higher.In Prince <PERSON>George</PERSON> 's County as in most counties within the state , we have provided " Pro-Prosecution " training for law enforcement , emergency dispatchers , prosecutors , commissioners , court clerks , victim advocates and victim/witnesscoordinators . 
This training includes domestic violence dynamics , investigationand prosecution , victim resources , full faith and credit ( honoring of protectiveorders across state lines ) and this year will be expanded to include stalkingand strangulation.The courts obtain ongoing training each year with specific segments assigned todomestic violence including domestic violence dynamics . 
They are also briefed bythe Family Violence Council on batterer 's counseling including the differencebetween " anger management " and " intervention . " 
. . . The county offers shelter and counseling ( residential and non-residential ; victim , offender , and child ) through the Family Crisis Center ( FCC ) . 
As ourprimary domestic violence shelter , <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> provides 17 beds and also serves as asupervised visitation center . 
Limited transitional housing is available throughCommunity Ministries . 
The <ORGANIZATION>House of Ruth</ORGANIZATION> provides walk-in legal clinics in bothUpper Marlboro and <LOCATION>Hyattsville Courthouses</LOCATION> , counseling through the BaxterCenter , and in <DATE>2002</DATE> , initiated divorce and custody legal services.Court-mandated offender counseling is assigned to both <ORGANIZATION>FCC</ORGANIZATION> ( battererintervention ) and Compassion Power ( anger management ) , based upon offenderreview and appropriate treatment determination . 
However we interpret thisinformation , the fact remains that the need is greater than available resources.We have made substantial progress over the <DATE>last 5 years</DATE> , but many issues remainto be addressed and many services to be expanded.Prevention is based upon proactive rather than reactive initiatives , assistingthe victim and holding the abuser accountable . 
Informational and educationaloutreach is fundamental to successful prevention . 
Educating victims and thecommunity about rights , resources , the criminal justice system , and again , thedynamics of domestic violence is essential.We would like to promise every victim that we could protect him or herunconditionally . 
That , of course , is impossible , but the system in <LOCATION>PrinceGeorge 's County</LOCATION> has much to offer : the emergency interim protective order ( the24/7 bill available at 3 commissioner locations 24 hours per day ) ; the temporaryprotective order ; the protective order ; counseling ; shelter ; legal services ; court accompaniment and court system information . . . . The public is beginning to recognize that the victim is not to blame , and tounderstand that the question is not " Why does n't she just leave ? " 
but " Why doeshe batter ? " 
The victim may always feel fear , shame , guilt , and responsibility.The offender may still commit violent offenses and attempt to manipulate thesystem . 
Our task is to improve service in the areas of education , outreach , training and legislation in order to promote the most comprehensive servicepossible.Domestic violence can be addressed through a collaborative effort from allmembers on the <ORGANIZATION>Prince George 's County Domestic Violence Coordinating Council.Prince George 's County</ORGANIZATION> has a well-established Domestic Violence CoordinatingCouncil , which has been in existence over 10 years . 
Members include : currentchair , <ORGANIZATION>District Court</ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON>Patrice Lewis</PERSON> ; Office of the <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> 's Attorney ; Office of the Sheriff ; <ORGANIZATION>Prince George 's County Police Department</ORGANIZATION> ; Parole andProbation ; <ORGANIZATION>Mental Hygiene Office of the Court ; Child Protective Services</ORGANIZATION> ; SexualAssault Center ; Juvenile Justice ; Family Crisis Center ( shelter and counseling ) ; House of Ruth ( legal advocacy ) ; Compassion Power ( batterer 's counseling ) ; <PERSON>Zonta</PERSON> ( professional women 's volunteer association ) ; the <ORGANIZATION>Human Relations Commission</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Community Ministries</ORGANIZATION> , and <ORGANIZATION>Andrews Air Force Base Family Advocacy Unit</ORGANIZATION> . 
Thiscouncil , as a collaborative unit , assists with problems placed before it as wellas implementing new initiatives and community outreach . 
Specific individualsalso serve as liaisons to the <ORGANIZATION>Maryland Network Against Domestic Violence</ORGANIZATION> and theState Family Violence Council . . . . As a result of a tragic domestic violence incident on <DATE>March 11 , 2003</DATE> . . . <ORGANIZATION>Prince George 's County Government</ORGANIZATION> launched a comprehensive review of internalpolicies and procedures to determine where such processes and procedures can befurther strengthened to prevent this event from ever occurring in the future . 
. 
. 
. 
Each county organization and/or agency that participated on this task force waschallenged to examine the people , processes and technology opportunities thatcould be used to bring increased safety to domestic violence victims in <LOCATION>PrinceGeorge 's County</LOCATION> . 
Experts agree that domestic violence is a widespread problemthat can not be easily quantified due to many incidents that are not reported.Thus , the task force scope also included ways of ensuring that appropriateinformation is available to both those victims who have reported an incident andthose who have not.As a result of the task force review , several policies , procedures , andpractices have been either modified , updated , or changed to reflect a moreproactive and sensitive approach to domestic violence concerns in PrinceGeorge 's County .
