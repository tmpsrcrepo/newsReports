President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> is scheduled to sign legislation <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that will end themilitary 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , officially shifting to the DefenseDepartment the political pressure surrounding the repeal of the 17-year ban ongays serving openly in uniform.Even after <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> scrawls his signature , the law wo n't actually change until thePentagon certifies to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that the military has met several preconditions , including education and training programs for troops . 
On <DATE>Monday</DATE> , Pentagonofficials repeatedly declined to predict how long they would need , saying onlythat they would proceed at a " methodical " and " deliberate " pace . 
" I do n't think anybody has any idea yet how long this will take , " <PERSON>Pentagonspokesman Geoff Morrell</PERSON> said.As senior military leaders prepare to integrate openly gay men and lesbians , they are drawing on conclusions of a <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> study outlining tricky scenariosthat might arise . 
Among the hypothetical situations in the report : A chaplain ' ssermon includes several direct statements calling homosexuality a sin . 
Anapplicant informs recruiters that he is gay . 
Troops are heard making jokes aboutusing the same showers as gay colleagues.Some commanders who oppose the repeal warned in the days before <DATE>Saturday</DATE> ' shistoric vote to end the ban that such incidents could compromise the military ' sability to fight two wars . 
But the 300-plus-page report provides potentialsolutions for each , and reminds commanders that such issues should be treatedthe same as incidents of harassment , racism or sexism.The sermons and teachings of the chaplain could not be restricted , unless hepublicly maligned military leaders , the report said . 
The applicant who shareshis sexual orientation should be handled like any other recruit . 
Commandersshould remind the joking troops that discrimination or harassment against gaycolleagues is inappropriate , but could grant a service member 's request not toshower among them.The process of ending the ban should not be " overly burdensome , " <ORGANIZATION>White Housepress</ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON>Robert Gibbs</PERSON> said Monday.In an e-mail sent <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> to airmen , <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Chief of Staff <PERSON>Norton A.Schwartz</PERSON> said : " The standards of conduct we expect of all <ORGANIZATION>Airmen</ORGANIZATION> will notchange . 
Moreover , we will continue to treat each other , as members of the AirForce family , with dignity and respect . 
" <PERSON>Clifford L. Stanley</PERSON> , the undersecretary of <ORGANIZATION>defense</ORGANIZATION> for personnel , will lead thepolicy overhaul , the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> said . 
The change will not occur until <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Robert M. Gates</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mulleninform Congress</ORGANIZATION> in writing that the military is prepared for implementation andhas drafted the necessary policies and regulations . 
Those changes must notaffect troop readiness , cohesion , or military recruitment and retention , according to the law . 
Once the written notice is submitted , 60 days must elapsebefore " do n't ask , do n't tell " is officially repealed.Gay rights leaders who pushed to end the policy think the military could endfull enforcement in a matter of weeks . 
" The troops already know how to interact with gays because they do so everyday , " said <PERSON>Aaron Belkin</PERSON> , executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Palm Center</ORGANIZATION> , a think tank atthe <ORGANIZATION>University of California</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> that is devoted to the study ofgays in the military.Some gay rights activists are urging <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> and Gates to issue an immediatemoratorium on the discharge of gay troops . 
<PERSON>Morrell</PERSON> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> that doing so wasunlikely , but he noted that Gates previously tightened the rules under whichservice members can be kicked out of the military for being gay.The new rules , which took effect <DATE>Oct. 21</DATE> , require the secretaries of the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> to review all discharge cases . 
Since then , no one has beenforced out under the new policy , <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> officials said . 
Cases that were in thebureaucratic pipeline before <DATE>October</DATE> , however , have resulted in some recentdischarges ; <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> officials said they could not say how <PERSON>many.Frank Barrett</PERSON> , a professor of management and organizational behavior at theNaval <ORGANIZATION>Postgraduate School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Monterey</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> , predicted that the military willmove quickly to implement the new law , but that the ease of doing so will varywidely among the different branches . 
" The real challenge of repealing ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' is that it challengesthe warrior ethos , what it means to be a warrior , " <PERSON>Barrett</PERSON> said . 
Warriors , hesaid , forge a " bonding love " during combat and preparation for war . 
The questionthat arises , he said , is : Can people who are uncomfortable with gays continue toform those close warrior bonds with openly gay troops ? 
" The Marines are going to have the hardest time , and the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> is going tohave the easiest time , " he said . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> does n't do eye-to-eye combat.But Marines , they are close-knit in close quarters , and the identity ofhyper-masculinity is so core to their mission . 
" Gen. <PERSON>James F. Amos</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>Marine Corps</ORGANIZATION> commandant and one of the chief critics ofending the ban , said <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that <ORGANIZATION>Marines</ORGANIZATION> " will step out smartly to faithfullyimplement this new policy . 
" Among many <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> officers , news of the repeal yielded more of a shrug thancelebration or outrage . 
" The talk among most of my soldiers is , ' We do n't care , ' " said one <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> officerat <PERSON>Fort Stewart</PERSON> , <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION> " The perception has been for a while that this is a donedeal and is going to happen sooner or later . 
" Most officers said that repealing the law would at least bring some clarity tothe murky situation surrounding it . 
One officer who recently went through apre-command course to prepare him to lead a combat arms battalion said thepossibility of ending the law barely came up during several weeks of courses . 
" Culturally , it will be okay - especially with the younger soldiers , " theofficer said . 
A worry that he and many others share is that the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> wouldoverreact to perceived problems in a unit and institute some form ofmilitary-wide training . 
" My biggest concern is how stupid the bureaucracy gets if something happens , " the officer said . 
He and other officers were spoke on the condition of anonymitybecause they are not authorized to discuss the matter on the record.ed.okeefe@washingtonpost.comwhitlockc@washpost.comStaff writer <PERSON>Greg Jaffe</PERSON> contributed to this report .
