Sirens and blood . 
When there 's a pileup on I-95 , the <ORGANIZATION>National Highway TrafficSafety Administration</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> ) gathers up all the details -- the make of thevehicles , the time of day , the place on the highway , whether the victims werewearing seatbelts or the drivers were drunk.Blood and sirens . 
When a person blows his head off in the kitchen or the woods , or when someone is murdered in an alleyway , well -- forget it . 
There 's noequivalent system that collects the details of the death and analyzes thepatterns of these violent injuries.This is the <ORGANIZATION>Fatal Data Gap</ORGANIZATION> . 
One kind of sudden violent death is routinelystudied on a nationwide basis ; another kind is not . 
Yet about 50,000 Americanssuffer a nontraffic violent death every year , almost all from suicide andhomicide.To reduce the toll , researchers need to know how and why these fatalities <PERCENT>occur.What percent</PERCENT> of young people who take their own lives are intoxicated at thetime of death ? 
How often does a child die from abuse -- every two hours or twodays?Nobody really knows . 
The <ORGANIZATION>National Center for Health Statistics</ORGANIZATION> collectsinformation from death certificates . 
The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> collects information aboutoffenders and victims of crime . 
But the two systems are n't linked . 
Thecircumstances that led to the violence are often not recorded . 
Information isscattered among different local and federal agencies . 
There 's no nationalreporting system on these deaths like <ORGANIZATION>NHTSA</ORGANIZATION> 's Fatality Analysis Reporting System ( FARS ) . 
Now that 's about to change . 
At President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's request , the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention ( CDC ) has started a small <MONEY>$ 1.5 million</MONEY> project to set <ORGANIZATION>upa National Violent Death Reporting System.It</ORGANIZATION> builds on the innovative statewide reporting system in <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> and a pilotprogram sponsored by <ORGANIZATION>Harvard 's School of Public Health</ORGANIZATION> in seven areas of thecountry . 
The goal is to analyze these fatalities so that public health officialswill have a scientific basis for designing preventive strategies . 
" Our knowledge of these events is fragmented . 
That 's why it 's so exciting to seethe dots being connected , " says <PERSON>Stephen W. Hargarten</PERSON> , who heads the emergencymedicine department at <ORGANIZATION>the Medical College of Wisconsin</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION> . 
As hemakes clear : " I 'm a physician . 
This is a health problem . 
" You notice that so far I have avoided the mention of one key word : guns.Nobody wants to rouse the gun lobby and give it a reason to block thisinitiative . 
Language is important . 
The project is not called the firearmfatality surveillance program . 
It is the <ORGANIZATION>National Violent Death Reporting Systemthat</ORGANIZATION> will collect data regardless of the weapon used -- a gun , a fist or aknife . 
" Everyone can be for it , " says <PERSON>David Hemenway</PERSON> , director of <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> 's injurycontrol research center . 
" The more data , the better . 
This is not only morepolitically correct . 
It makes a lot more sense in terms of the science . 
" For decades public health officials tried to address gun violence the way theytackled tobacco use and other leading causes of death . 
Former surgeon general C.Everett <PERSON>Koop</PERSON> labeled the bullet a pathogen . 
But targeting gun injuries can behazardous to research . 
A pilot project at <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> to monitor firearmfatalities drew ire from gun advocates and was stopped after three years . 
Nowall money appropriated to <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> to study injuries comes with a stipulation fromCongress that the funds can not be used to advocate for gun control.Still , guns are the significant factor . 
Easier access to guns may explain whyhomicide rates are so much higher in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> than in other high-incomecountries . 
The overall crime rates for robbery , car theft and sexual assault areabout the same . 
But the homicide rate is about five times higher in thiscountry . 
Among children aged 5 to 14 , the gun suicide rate is 10 times higher.Even within the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , many more gun suicides occur in " high gun " states -- places such as <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Wyoming</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> , where gun ownership ismore common -- than in " low gun " states like <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> and NewJersey.By not focusing on guns , the new initiative makes an effort to create somecommon ground between pro-gun and anti-gun groups . 
As <ORGANIZATION>James A. Mercy of CDC</ORGANIZATION> ' sinjury prevention program says : " People with all points of view on guns cansupport collecting objective data on this problem . 
" The reporting system is modeled after the national traffic safety program , whichanalyzes all the factors that lead to fatal injuries . 
Out of this informationhas come seat belt and motorcycle helmet laws , better car designs , campaignsagainst drunk driving . 
Automobile fatalities have fallen about <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> permile driven over 50 years.The same bonanza in saved lives could come from a national reporting system onviolent death . 
There are already tantalizing clues from <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> 's pilot program.Location is a key determinant of violent death , for example . 
More than 65percent of women who are murdered are killed at home , while more than 80 percentof men are murdered away from home . 
The implication : Putting more police on thestreets is not likely to protect women , but home visits by social workers might.A national reporting system could also evaluate interventions . 
In <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> , researchers found that guns recovered in local buyback campaigns were not thekind of guns used in homicides -- which suggests that buybacks may not reducethe toll of gun fatalities.All in all , good data will lead to better public health.Abigail Trafford can be reached by e-mail at trafforda@washpost.com .
