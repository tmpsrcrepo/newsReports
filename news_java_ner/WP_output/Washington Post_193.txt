Feeling the cold these days ? 
Then hurry on down to sign up for <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> MajorityLeader <PERSON>John Boehner</PERSON> 's week-long fact-finding trip to <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> andMexico , taking off <DATE>Jan. 8</DATE> . 
The <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> Republican is scheduled to escape the chill with Democratic Rep. <PERSON>DanBoren</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>Okla.</LOCATION> ) and Republican Reps. <PERSON>Dave Camp</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION> ) , <PERSON>John Kline</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION> ) , DocHastings ( <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION> ) , <PERSON>Devin Nunes</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> ) and <PERSON>Greg Walden</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION> ) . 
Nunes is the onlyone on this congressional delegation ( codel ) with a chance of decent weatherback home this time of year.The lawmakers are apparently going to be talking to government officials downthere about drugs , trade and other issues . 
No word from <PERSON>Boehner</PERSON> 's folks aboutthe specifics of the itinerary . 
( We 'll check in later to see whether the Brazilleg included stops in Salvador or Rio . ) 
Worried about leaving your spouse back in the cold ? 
Bring him or her along . 
It ' sno problem - the other spouses are coming . 
And there 'll be three or four staffmembers to help out . 
Remember , this is pretty much the ultimate in luxurytravel , business class on a government jet , with pampering by military aides.This jaunt , as far as we can tell , breaks only two of the six rules in theofficial , updated In the Loop Guide to Codels . 
( You can refresh your memory atwapo.st / codel-rules . ) 
Just JoeSpeaking of codels , we 're hearing that Sen. <PERSON>Joseph I. Lieberman</PERSON> ( I-Conn . ) 
istaking a very , very small delegation to the Holy Land , arriving <DATE>Dec. 26</DATE> with hiswife , <ORGANIZATION>Hadassah</ORGANIZATION> , via commercial jet . 
She 'll stay behind as the lame-duck senatorand two staffers continue on , perhaps by military jet , to four other countriesin the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> . 
It 's a codel of one , since no other senators signed on.Something for the counterDesperate for a gift for that special someone who has everything ? 
Bet he or shedoes n't have the <DATE>2012</DATE> Counterterrorism Calendar , produced by the NationalCounterterrorism Center.The calendars are given out as a resource guide for law enforcement andintelligence officials and folks in the anti-terror biz , especially for thoseworking in the field . 
That 's why there are pages on ways to spot and deal withbiological and chemical attacks , " suspicious financial activity indicators , " orpeople using false passports.A downloadable , interactive version is on the NCTC Web site , www.nctc.gov , butyou ca n't buy the 5-by-9-inch spiral version anywhere . 
Got to know someone.That 's what makes it special . 
In addition , the <ORGANIZATION>NCTC</ORGANIZATION> , trying to reduce costs , printed <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> fewer calendars this year , so they 're even harder to get.And do n't throw out the <DATE>2011</DATE> calendar . 
It 's the last one featuring the cool <MONEY>$ 25million</MONEY> reward for Osama bin Laden , who 's no longer on the wanted list . 
( Notipster was deemed worthy of the award . ) 
And it 's the only calendar ever to feature <PERSON>Anwar al-Awlaki</PERSON> , the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizen whoallegedly orchestrated the failed Christmas <DATE>2009</DATE> underwear bombing of aDetroit-bound jet . 
That was his last appearance - he was killed by a missilestrike in <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> in September.Sins of the son?You never call , you never write , you never come around to see us any more . 
Anold pal , <LOCATION>Equatorial Guinea</LOCATION> " President " <PERSON>Teodoro Obiang Nguema</PERSON> , now ( with <PERSON>Gaddafigone</PERSON> ) <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> 's longest-serving dictator , was in town last week to receive theBeacon for <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> award at the <DATE>2011</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Sullivan Honors</ORGANIZATION> dinner and did n't even dropus a note.Obiang , Loop Fans may recall , created a bit of a fuss the last couple of yearstrying to get a <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Educational</ORGANIZATION> , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( <ORGANIZATION>UNESCO</ORGANIZATION> ) award - which he endowed for five years with a <MONEY>$ 3 million</MONEY> gift - until the humanrights crowd went ballistic.Seems Obiang , in power since <DATE>1979</DATE> and once winner of <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> of the vote , keeps getting slammed by <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> reports of " arbitrary arrest , detention , and incommunicado detention " and judicial corruption and so on . 
( Well , nobody 's perfect . ) 
So <ORGANIZATION>UNESCO</ORGANIZATION> backed down.The award is named for <PERSON>Leon H. Sullivan</PERSON> , a minister , civil rights leader andlongtime <ORGANIZATION>General Motors</ORGANIZATION> board member who authored the <ORGANIZATION>Sullivan Principles</ORGANIZATION> forbusinesses operating in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> during the apartheid era . 
Past winnersinclude Presidents <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> II and Secretaries of State HillaryClinton and <PERSON>Condoleezza Rice.Maybe Obiang</PERSON> did n't call because he was worried about his 44-year-old son , <PERSON>Teodoro Nguema Obiang</PERSON> ? 
Seems the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> recently went to court toseize <MONEY>$ 70 million</MONEY> of his assets . 
The department recounted purchases he made inthe last decade or so , such as : a <MONEY>$ 10 million</MONEY> fleet of cars that included eightFerraris , seven Rolls-Royces , two Lamborghinis , a <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> , an <ORGANIZATION>Aston Martin</ORGANIZATION> and aMaserati.Then there was the <MONEY>$ 38 million</MONEY> Gulfstream and the <LOCATION>Malibu</LOCATION> villa overlooking thePacific for <MONEY>$ 30 million</MONEY> , which he decorated last year with <PERSON>Michael Jacksonmemorabilia</PERSON> bought at <ORGANIZATION>auctions.The Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> said all that was " inconsistent with his salary " of <MONEY>$ 81,000</MONEY> a year and came from plundering the tiny country 's large reserves ofnatural gas and oil.But wait a minute . 
If you live really , really frugally . . . Pols gone wildWe wonder whether former congressman <PERSON>Anthony Weinerwould</PERSON> find any consolation inthe fact that even though his political career is toast , he 's still a winner . 
. 
. 
of the <LOCATION>Loop</LOCATION> 's title of biggest political scandal of <DATE>2011</DATE> . 
We asked Loop blog readers to pick the year 's worst headline-making naughtiness , and they voted for the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Democrat 's Twit-pic controversy over a slate ofothers . 
Coming in second was the allegations of sexual harassment and an affairagainst former <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate <PERSON>Herman Cain.You</PERSON> can see the rest of the results on our blog at washingtonpost.com/intheloop.We're not sure what to make of the fact that Loopers think that <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON> 's sexlesssex scandal ( which some thought he could have weathered if he 'd handled itbetter ) was worse than the allegations of sexual assault on a teenage girl byformer congressman <PERSON>David Wu</PERSON> ( D-Calif . ) 
- that scandal came in last place.But it probably comes down to simple notoriety : <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON> 's controversial pics wereshared on Twitter , which is a new frontier for political scandals . 
And thenthere 's his unfortunate , made-for-tabloid-headlines name - and the fact thatthose pictures will live on in Internet eternity.So let 's take a moment and thank good old <DATE>2011</DATE> for bringing us such a rich arrayof poorly behaving pols . 
Here 's the <LOCATION>Loop</LOCATION> 's wish for <DATE>2012</DATE> : <DATE>May</DATE> they never learntheir lessons . 
( Hey , we need the fodder ! )
