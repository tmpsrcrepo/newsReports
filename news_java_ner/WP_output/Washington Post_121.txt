It has been a dizzying few weeks for women in the workplace.Forty years after the Civil Rights Act and just days after news of high-profilesex-discrimination cases involving <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Morgan Stanley</ORGANIZATION> , a new report bythe <ORGANIZATION>National Partnership for Women & Families</ORGANIZATION> has found that women of all racesare still being discriminated against in the workplace.Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from discriminating basedon race , color , religion , sex or national origin . 
And although women have madesignificant progress since the act was passed , they still face discrimination , and often in much more complex ways , the report concluded.The partnership , founded in <DATE>1971</DATE> as the Women 's Legal Defense Fund , worked with10 years ' worth of discrimination claims provided by the <ORGANIZATION>Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission</ORGANIZATION> , and broke down the charges by race , age and ethnicity.The study , " Women at Work : Looking Behind the Numbers 40 Years After the CivilRights Act of <DATE>1964</DATE> , " concluded that " women of color as well as older andimmigrant women are especially likely to experience certain types ofdiscrimination . 
" Data showed that claims of sexual harassment and sex discrimination continue torise , but the number of claims filed by white women have decreased , while thosefiled by black and Hispanic women have increased . 
" We wanted to look behind the numbers , because we thought there was a storythere about what 's happening in workplace , " said <PERSON>Jocelyn Frye</PERSON> , director ofworkplace fairness programs at the partnership and primary author of the study . 
" We get frustrated when people talk generically about women or discrimination.We know there 's a more nuanced story . " 
" We agree wholeheartedly that sex discrimination against women is still a majorproblem in the workplace , " said <PERSON>David Grinberg</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>EEOC</ORGANIZATION> spokesman . 
The <ORGANIZATION>EEOC</ORGANIZATION> did a " Women of Color " study about six months ago with similar findings . 
" Women ofcolor face a double dose of discrimination . 
It is a lingering problem we ' readdressing , " <PERSON>Grinberg</PERSON> said.The data confirm , <PERSON>Frye</PERSON> said , that people are being discriminated against in allof the categories listed in Title VII , and more so if they are women . 
Thenumbers illustrate " the combination of gender , race , and ethnicity can play arole in how different women are treated -- or mistreated -- at work , " she wrote.The data also show that even a decrease in a particular type of claim can hideanother piece of the story . 
For example : The overall number ofage-discrimination claims has gone down during the past decade . 
But when thepartnership broke those claims down by race and other characteristics of thecomplainant , it found that age-discrimination claims filed by women hadincreased . 
" One of the big conclusions we drew from all that is we need to look . . . atnumbers in more sophisticated ways than they 've been doing , so we can see howit 's happening and we can enforce " anti-discrimination laws , <PERSON>Frye said.Grinberg</PERSON> said the statistics the <ORGANIZATION>EEOC</ORGANIZATION> gave the partnership are in fact used bythe <ORGANIZATION>EEOC</ORGANIZATION> in its enforcement.The data showed that during the past decade , the number of sex-discriminationcharges filed with the <ORGANIZATION>EEOC</ORGANIZATION> increased by <PERCENT>10.5 percent</PERCENT> . 
White women file moreclaims than women of color do , but white women 's claims , while going up and downfrom year to year , declined <PERCENT>11.5 percent</PERCENT> <DATE>from 1992</DATE> to <DATE>2003</DATE> . 
Meanwhile , black women filed 3,898 sex discrimination charges in <DATE>1992</DATE> , and 4,686 in <DATE>2003</DATE> , a <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> increase . 
Hispanic women filed 1,052 charges in <DATE>1992</DATE> and1 ,763 charges in <DATE>2003</DATE> , a <PERCENT>68 percent</PERCENT> increase . 
" A significant portion of the increase in sex-discrimination claims over thelast decade can be traced to the growing number of women of color filingcomplaints , " the report says.The report found that sexual harassment claims have increased <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT> duringthe past decade . 
And it was not only women who filed : Men filed <PERCENT>14.7 percent</PERCENT> ofsexual harassment charges in <DATE>2003</DATE> , up from <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> a decade ago.Meanwhile , complaints filed by women who face discrimination because they are ormay become pregnant have increased by <PERCENT>39 percent</PERCENT> during the decade , even as thenation has seen a <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> drop in its birth rate , according to the report.The increase can be at least partially attributed to the fact that there aremore women in the workforce today , but that instances of discrimination stilloccur is disappointing and frustrating , <PERSON>Frye</PERSON> said . 
Although the partnershiptimed the report to be released near the anniversary of the Civil Rights Act , itwas by accident that it also was released as the <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> and Morgan Stanleysex-discrimination cases became more public . 
Those cases , <PERSON>Frye</PERSON> said , althoughnot surprising , are still " a little shocking . " 
" It sort of gives you great pause , and you think , ' How can this still behappening ? ' 
But on other hand , if you look closely at the data , this is not anew story , " she said . 
" Discrimination is still out there .
