Watching <PERSON>Jerry Kilgore</PERSON> 's latest TV ads in the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> governor 's race , youmight conclude that <PERSON>Tim Kaine</PERSON> is a Hitler lover and that <PERSON>Kilgore</PERSON> 's idea ofjustice comes from the Taliban.In the commonwealth where <PERSON>Thomas Jefferson</PERSON> and <PERSON>James Madison</PERSON> once debated thepurpose of government , we now get to watch the tortured relatives of murdervictims go on TV in new <LOCATION>Kilgore</LOCATION> ads that use every tacky trick in the book toknee <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> in the groin.The spots are devilishly well-made , from the soft lighting and weepy narrator tothe tinkling piano music and <PERSON>Kilgore</PERSON> 's simply beautiful eye blink of utterhonesty . 
But their content is pernicious : " <PERSON>Tim Kaine</PERSON> voluntarily represented theperson who murdered my son , " the father of a murdered man says in one ad . 
This , we are supposed to believe , is a heinous act.In the warped world of TV campaigning , we have one candidate for governor whodoes n't believe in the American system of justice and another who coddles massmurderers.From that same ad : " <PERSON>Tim Kaine</PERSON> says that <PERSON>Adolf Hitler</PERSON> does n't qualify for thedeath penalty . 
" Here 's what <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> really said when the <ORGANIZATION>Richmond Times-Dispatch</ORGANIZATION> asked if peoplelike Hitler should be executed : " Well , you know . . . . God grants life and God should take it away . 
Do horrible , heinous things deserve incredible punishment ? 
You bet . 
" <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> talked about his religious opposition to taking a life , and exceptionssuch as self-defense and a just war . 
Pushed , he said terrible criminals " maydeserve " death , but noted that " most nations have decided not to have a deathpenalty , and many are very safe . 
" Sorry , <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> , but this was no <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> moment , named for the 1988presidential nominee who torpedoed his campaign by flatly remarking that he ' doppose the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife . 
I 'd wantto tear apart such a thug , and I bet <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> would , too.But I 'd also want the state to rise above my vengeful rage and stand for theprinciple that government is no murderer . 
I think that 's what <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> believesinside , but I ca n't report that as a fact because <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> is playing games . 
Hewants us to give him a bye because his convictions are grounded in his religion.People on both sides of this debate would grant <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> and his Catholic faithgreat respect because there is a poetic consistency to the church 's belief inprotecting life from either the death penalty or abortion.But <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> does n't stop there . 
No , he wants us to believe that in both cases , hecan and would separate his personal beliefs from his pledge to uphold the law.He opposes abortion , but he 'd enforce laws that allow it . 
He opposes the deathpenalty , but he 'd sign death warrants and marshal legal resources to kill morecapital convicts.Kaine , a terrific lawyer , is well-versed in the art of arguing for that whichyou do not believe . 
But this makes no sense as a basis for election as governor.We elect people not only for their managerial skill , but for their moral andcivic leadership . 
I want to vote for people who believe what they stand for andstand for what they believe in.When <PERSON>John Kennedy</PERSON> said in the <DATE>1960</DATE> campaign that his first allegiance was to hiscountry , not to the pope in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> , he was allaying the fears of Protestants whoincorrectly believed that Catholics mindlessly followed the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> ' sdirectives . 
<PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> is trying to wrap himself in <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> 's glow , but this is adifferent issue . 
Many American Roman Catholics reject some of the church ' steachings . 
If <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> said , okay , here 's where I differ with my church , mostvoters would accept that . 
Instead , he embraces those teachings in his heart , yetresolves to ignore them in his daily work . 
That 's just too cynical.Yet it is not even in the same realm of cynicism as <ORGANIZATION>Kilgore</ORGANIZATION> 's spots . 
FewVirginians put the death penalty , abortion , guns or gay adoption even close tothe top of their concerns , yet those issues are at the heart of <LOCATION>Kilgore</LOCATION> ' scampaign.Here 's what matters : Neither of these guys has any intention of attackingNorthern <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's transportation mess . 
Neither will come clean about the needto raise and spend money.So Virginians must choose : Insist that candidates speak to the issues that hithome , or sit back and enjoy <PERSON>Kilgore</PERSON> 's spots as a fine example of the high art ofthe American cleverness industry , based on the bedrock belief that voters aredumb as stumps.Join me at noon todayfor " Potomac Confidential " atwww.washingtonpost.com/liveonline .
