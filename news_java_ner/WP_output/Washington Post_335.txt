<LOCATION>PITTSBURGH</LOCATION> - As <PERSON>Jim Boeheim</PERSON> walked across the court <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> at <ORGANIZATION>ConsolEnergy Center</ORGANIZATION> to do his obligatory postgame TV interview , he let out a deepbreath , stuck his hands in his pockets and looked for all the world like someonewho had just spent most of the day in a dentist 's chair.A few minutes later , when the news conference moderator informed reporters thatSyracuse 's 75-59 victory over <LOCATION>Kansas State</LOCATION> in the round of 32 gave <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> 47NCAA tournament victories - tying him with <PERSON>John Wooden</PERSON> on the all-time list - <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> sighed and shook his head . 
" Yeah he did it in 10 years ; it took 29 for me , " he said . 
" That 's about rightfor me . 
" If <LOCATION>Eeyore</LOCATION> was a basketball coach , he would be <PERSON>Jim Boeheim</PERSON> . 
Especially thesedays.In private , <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> is about as bright , funny and engaging as anyone inbasketball . 
He has also put together coaching numbers that are astounding , regardless of how many years it has taken him to achieve them . 
<DATE>Saturday</DATE> ' svictory was the 889th of his career and put him in the Sweet 16 for the 16thtime . 
The only coaches in history with more wins than <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> are <ORGANIZATION>MikeKrzyzewski</ORGANIZATION> at 927 and <PERSON>Bob Knight</PERSON> at 902 . 
What 's more , the argument can be made that at the age of 67 , <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> is a bettercoach now than he 's ever been . 
This <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> team is 33-2 and , as <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> pointsout , has found different ways to win all season.None of that , though , is the focal point when people talk about <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> rightnow , and it has n't been since late last fall when <PERSON>Bernie Fine</PERSON> , <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> ' slongtime assistant and close friend , was forced to resign after being accused ofsexual abuse by two former <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> ballboys.It is fair to say that <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> , in spite of all his team 's victories , has hadvery few moments of peace since then . 
He came out swinging at Fine 's accusersand then had to apologize , even though he no doubt still believes every word hesaid . 
Now <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> is completely gagged by his lawyers on the subject , but thatdoes n't mean he is n't waging battles on other fronts.He 's had to answer questions about a report that a number of ex-Syracuse playerstested positive for recreational drugs several years ago and were neversubjected to the school 's rules on drug use . 
Then starting center Fab Melo wasdeclared ineligible for the second time this season just before the NCAAtournament began.A <DATE>day later</DATE> , Secretary of Education <PERSON>Arne Duncan</PERSON> , talking about <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> graduationrates , appeared to single out <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> when he mentioned that one college coachhad called the idea of penalizing schools for failing to graduate players " completely nuts . 
" <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> took umbrage with <PERSON>Duncan</PERSON> 's comments on <DATE>Friday</DATE> - saying he had called twoelements of the graduation rate standards nuts , but not the idea itself - andwas also upset with _ blanka <ORGANIZATION>USA Today</ORGANIZATION> story that said if the new standards werein place this season , <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> would not have been eligible to play . 
" Not true , " <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> said . 
" They 're using outdated statistics . 
If they 'd have called us wecould have told them that . 
" And of course , there was the controversial ending to _ blankThursday ' sfirst-round victory over <LOCATION>UNC Asheville</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> did n't mind seeing severalthousand replays of a pass that clearly went off <PERSON>Brandon Triche</PERSON> 's hands but wasawarded to <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION> anyway - although he did say he thought <PERSON>Triche</PERSON> had beenfouled . 
He did mind several TV commentators criticizing a lane-violation callmade against <LOCATION>Asheville</LOCATION> at a crucial moment in the game . 
" TV commentators do a disservice to the game when they say , ' You ca n't callthat , ' " <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> said , standing in the bowels of the building 45 minutes afterhis team 's win on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> . 
No one had raised the issue . 
<PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> did . 
" It 's arule . 
You have to call it . 
A violation is a violation . 
" <DATE>Saturday</DATE> was a good day for <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> . 
After struggling to a 25-24 lead athalftime even though <ORGANIZATION>Kansas State</ORGANIZATION> shot just 8 of 34 , the Orange pulled away inthe second half for an easy win - far easier than one might have expected afterThursday 's escape from the ignominy of being the first No. 1 seed to ever loseto a No. 16 seed . 
" We made some shots for the first time in a while , " <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> said . 
" The gamebecomes pretty simple when you make shots . 
Of course , the key was our defense . 
" The key for <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> is always its defense , the remarkably elastic 2-3 zone ithas played since <DATE>1996</DATE> - when <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> took a team picked to do very little in thepreseason all the way to the national championship game . 
Even without <PERSON>Melo</PERSON> inthe middle , the Orange are still a collection of long arms and legs inside andstill have nine players who can come in and play effectively.Boeheim realized early this season that this was probably the deepest team hehas ever coached . 
He even changed his practice routine , working his first fiveand his second five alternatively against his third five - a group that includesa redshirt and four walk-ons . 
" That third group is in really good shape , " hesaid , almost smiling for a moment . 
" I 've never done it that way before butchange is good - especially when you 're getting older . 
" There 's been a lot of talk about whether <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> will just walk away after thisseason , especially if his team wins the championship or reaches the Final Four.His close friend <PERSON>Krzyzewski</PERSON> - who is no doubt a lot unhappier than <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> , atleast this <DATE>weekend</DATE> - does n't think there is any way that will happen . 
" They 'll have to drag <PERSON>Jim</PERSON> off the sideline , " he said recently . 
" He 's not goinganywhere . 
He loves basketball and he loves coaching . 
" Boeheim disagrees with even with that . 
" I have never enjoyed coaching , " he said . 
" I hope someday if I need an operation , when that doctor walks into theoperating room he 's not there to enjoy himself . 
" What about after the operation is a success?For a moment he did actually smile . 
" If you have success , then you ' resatisfied , " he said . 
" That 's completely different . " 
He paused for a moment . 
" Iguess if you win a lot and you get a lot of satisfaction from the wins thenmaybe - maybe - you can enjoy it just a little . 
" He was laughing by now , something he has n't done much the last few months . 
Thebus was waiting . 
He walked down the hall and out the door . 
Another victory wasin his rear-view mirror.No doubt there are plenty of battles still ahead.For <PERSON>John Feinstein</PERSON> 's previous columns , go to washingtonpost.com/feinstein .
