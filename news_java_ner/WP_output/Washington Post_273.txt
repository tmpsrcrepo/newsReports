Maryland Attorney General <PERSON>Doug Gansler</PERSON> 's failure to report apparent underagedrinking at a raucous " Beach Week " party that he visited reminds us of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> ' sgross hypocrisy in keeping laws on the books that large swaths of society haveno intention of enforcing.Gansler , who 's running for governor , deserves all the criticism heaped on himfor his double talk over the incident in <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> . 
He said initially that he hadno moral authority over other people 's children , even though he 's recordedpublic service announcements discouraging teen drinking.Laughably , <PERSON>Gansler</PERSON> suggested he had n't been certain the youths ' red plastic cupscontained beer.Clearly , a top law enforcement official should n't be tolerating such wrongdoing.But let 's be honest : Thousands of local parents do the same every spring.They allow their 18-year-olds to celebrate graduating from high school with anunsupervised week at <ORGANIZATION>Ocean City</ORGANIZATION> or similar venue , where the rite of passageoften includes kegs , shots and the occasional blackout.It 's another example of how the legal drinking age of 21 is routinely ignored , especially on college campuses . 
Parents and other adult authorities often winkat the violations , or even cooperate to minimize potential harm by ensuring thatnobody drives drunk.We ought to have a large-scale public debate about lowering the drinking age to18 , combined with stepped-up education to encourage young people who want todrink to learn to do so responsibly and in moderation.Sadly , the political climate does n't allow such a discussion . 
Anybody whoquestions keeping the drinking age at 21 runs into a wall of opposition fromsuch advocates as <ORGANIZATION>Mothers Against Drunk Driving</ORGANIZATION> , or MADD.Supporters of the current law - which generally bars people under 21 frompurchase or public possession of alcohol - believe it 's vital to protect youngpeople . 
Nobody in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> wants to argue with that.Consider what happened to the Amethyst Initiative of <DATE>2008</DATE> . 
More than 130 collegeand university presidents declared that " twenty-one is not working . " 
They saidthe abstinence-only policy contributed to a dangerous culture of clandestinebinge drinking among students.Signers , who included the top officials at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Maryland</ORGANIZATION> and JohnsHopkins , stopped short of explicitly urging a lower drinking age . 
Instead , theycalled for " an informed and dispassionate public debate . 
" It did n't happen . 
The effort drew some interest but then withered under a blazeof righteous indignation . 
" It was immediately met with a vituperative response from <ORGANIZATION>MADD</ORGANIZATION> , which sentletters to everybody who signed it , saying they were endangering children undertheir care , " said <PERSON>Barrett Seaman</PERSON> , president of <ORGANIZATION>Choose Responsibility</ORGANIZATION> , thenonprofit group that launched the initiative . 
" It 's been hard for us , given that kind of pushback , to get others to take therisk , " he said.Now , I join practically everyone in applauding <ORGANIZATION>MADD</ORGANIZATION> for raising publicconsciousness to help stop drunken driving . 
I also concede there are risks inlowering the legal age to 18 . 
In particular , it could encourage more drinkingamong those 17 and younger.But people who defend the law have a responsibility to explain how they think itshould be enforced and why they think that 's not happening now.MADD says college administrators should do more . 
" It 's time for college campuses to step up to the plate , " said <PERSON>J.T. Griffin</PERSON> , thegroup 's chief government affairs officer . 
" Should n't we strive to have a placethat 's for learning , that 's not about going out on <DATE>Friday</DATE> or <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> andgetting wasted ? 
" But students I interviewed at U-Md . 
's <ORGANIZATION>College Park</ORGANIZATION> campus said the law wasunenforceable . 
Students use fake IDs or obtain alcohol from older friends - oreven their parents . 
" Virtually no one takes that law seriously , " said <PERSON>Rami Yanes</PERSON> , 18 , of Hagerstown.Even the school 's Baptist chaplain said under-21 drinking was so widespread thatcampus authorities settled for trying to limit the harm . 
" As long as students are not causing too much noise and there 's no report ofsexual assault or other major problems , they basically let it go , " JessicaSenasack said.Several students said lowering the drinking age could encourage more responsiblebehavior by bringing drinking out in the open . 
" People need to learn to be able to handle alcohol properly , " said <PERSON>India Lewis</PERSON> ,19 , of <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> . 
" If the drinking age were lower , and drinking were more acultural thing , they would be less sloppy about it . 
" University System of <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> Chancellor <PERSON>William Kirwan</PERSON> , who signed the AmethystInitiative <DATE>five years ago</DATE> , said through a spokesman that he stands by it . 
" He did not and does not endorse lowering the drinking age to under 21 , butrather supported a thorough public health policy discussion , " the spokesmansaid . 
<PERSON>Kirwan</PERSON> urged " thorough research on how young people can become informed tomake better and more responsible decisions with regard to alcohol that conformwith the law . 
" That 's a thoughtful , conscientious position . 
It deserves a full airing ratherthan instant dismissal.robert.mccartney@washpost.comFor my previous columns , go to washingtonpost.com/mccartney .
