As I write this , it is almost <TIME>6 p.m.</TIME> , and my family is assembling around the TV , eagerly awaiting the start of <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> 's " <PERSON>Lou Dobbs Tonight</PERSON> , " our favorite comedyshow.Now , if you 're thinking : " Hey , wait a minute , that 's not a comedy show ! 
That 's aserious look at world affairs hosted by a dignified , award-winning journalist , " then you either :1 ) do not watch the show , or2 ) are <PERSON>Lou Dobbs.Lou</PERSON> used to be an actual newsman , but then , some years ago , he apparentlyrealized that whenever he expressed outrage over illegal immigration oroutsourcing of jobs -- hot-button issues among the xenophobically inclined -- his viewership climbed . 
Like a pigeon in a box who gets rewarded with a cornkernel every time he flaps a designated wing , <PERSON>Lou</PERSON> was soon just one big madlyflapping right wing.Before I began watching this show , I had no strong opinion about illegalimmigration . 
Now , I 'm in favor of not only granting illegal immigrantscitizenship , but also of giving them each a fancy car and a semiautomaticweapon , if for no other reason than to watch " <PERSON>Lou Dobbs</PERSON> Tonight " and see if aman can literally explode from bluster.Lou grew up in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> , the son of a propane salesman , and if this soundsfamiliar , you are probably a fan of " King of the Hill , " another really funnyshow . 
As you can see from the twinned images on this page , the physicalresemblance between <PERSON>Lou</PERSON> and young <PERSON>Bobby Hill</PERSON> -- son of a <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> propane salesman -- is pretty dramatic . 
<PERSON>Hank Hill</PERSON> always looks at his son and says , " That boyai n't right . 
" I 'm just saying . 
" <PERSON>Lou Dobbs</PERSON> Tonight " can sneak up on you , like a pirate ship not flying its truecolors . 
At first , it appears to be a normal talk show in a familiar format , withnicely dressed men and women in swivel chairs speaking in pleasant , professionalaltos and baritones . 
But then odd things begin to happen . 
A typical segment on " <PERSON>Lou Dobbs</PERSON> Tonight " includes an interview with some newsmaker who agrees withLou entirely on every issue , so the conversations tend to go like this : Lou : What in the world is wrong with these politicians who want to sendmanufacturing jobs to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> ? 
What are they , idiots?Newsmaker : " Idiots " is too good a word for them , <PERSON>Lou</PERSON> . 
They 're vomit sandwicheson whole wheat toast.Lou : Vomit ? 
At least vomit has nutrients in it ! 
They 're feces on an onion bagel!Newsmaker : Feces ? 
Feces is too good a . . . If a charge is incendiary enough , <PERSON>Lou</PERSON> does n't demand all that much by way ofverification . 
Not long ago , his show suggested that illegal immigrants hadrecently caused nearly an eight-fold increase in leprosy here . 
Leprosy ! 
That ' llget your attention!Unfortunately , this proved to be somewhat false , but only in the limited sensethat illegal immigrants have n't caused a big rise inleprosy in this country , inasmuch as the number of new cases has actuallydeclined since <DATE>1988</DATE> . 
Lou 's source was a long-discredited report by a fulminatingracist with no medical credentials . 
The woman , now deceased , also believed thatmost Latino male immigrants were child and/or nun molesters.My favorite parts of " <PERSON>Lou Dobbs Tonight</PERSON> , " however , are his polls . 
Like many TVshows , <ORGANIZATION>LDT</ORGANIZATION> has gone interactive , using the Web to instantly report hisaudience 's views . 
The difference between this show and most others is that <PERSON>Lou</PERSON> ' svotes are never close . 
They reveal a startling unanimity of American opinion , always in agreement with <PERSON>Lou</PERSON> , usually by majorities of <PERCENT>95 percent</PERCENT> or more . 
<PERSON>Noone</PERSON> has gotten this kind of electoral support since Saddam Hussein.How does such a thing happen ? 
Lou 's polls read like this : Choice 1 : I think we need to do something about illegal aliens with poorpersonal hygiene who run amok and rape decent American women.Choice 2 : I think it is good if illegal aliens with poor personal hygiene runamok and rape decent American women.Okay , the show is starting now , and here 's <LOCATION>Lou</LOCATION> . 
Hang on , I 'll be back when it ' sover.IT WAS A PRETTY TYPICAL SHOW . 
The main issue was the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> 's immigration reformbill , which had garnered surprisingly bipartisan support . 
But <PERSON>Lou</PERSON> hates thisbill . 
He called it a " pathetic charade " and said that the senators who supportit are " acting like clowns " and that their arguments are " just nuts . " 
Then , toshow his evenhandedness , he brought on both a Democrat and a Republican whooppose the bill.Finally , his poll . 
Here 's how Lou phrased the question : " Is a bad immigrationbill better than no bill at all ? 
" <PERCENT>Ninety-seven percent</PERCENT> of the viewers decided a bad bill is . . . bad.Gene <PERSON>Weingarten</PERSON> 's e-mail address is weingarten@washpost.comChat with him online <DATE>Tuesdays</DATE> at noon at www.washingtonpost.com .
