Is it because it 's so different from her lifegrowing up ? 
" I 've heard that before , that it could be my response to everything that ' shappened to me , " said the 23-year-old . 
" I think there could be some truth tothat . 
" Jasmine thinks the way she dresses - " crazy " dyed hair , colored contact lenses , a tattoo on her arm from her favorite book , " The Little Prince " - is also areaction to a painful childhood . 
" I just tried to create this new person who had not been abused or had not gonethrough all these things , " she said . 
" Or at least carried herself and lookedlike she was above all that stuff . 
" Jasmine was sexually abused as a teenager and left her home in NortheastWashington at 17 . 
After living for a week with strangers she 'd met on the street ( " It 's always really dangerous for young people in that situation , " she said ) and spending the night in a park , she walked to <PERSON>Sasha Bruce Youthwork</PERSON> . 
She ' dfound the charity after going to the library and searching " youth shelters dc " on one of the public computers.Has there ever been a better use of Google?Sasha <PERSON>Bruce Youthwork</PERSON> - a partner in The Post 's Helping Hand fundraising drive - runs <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 's only 24-hour emergency homeless shelter for teenagers .

" These were things she had not often heard.Through <PERSON>Sasha Bruce Youthwork</PERSON> , Jasmine got a seasonal job - as a censusenumerator - then trained to be an HIV peer counselor .
