It 's hard to believe this nasty and brutish presidential campaign is coming toan end.According to our Pinocchio Tracker , through most of the race President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> andRepublican challenger <PERSON>Mitt Romney</PERSON> were neck and neck for the average number ofPinocchios , about two each . 
But then in the final months of the campaign , Romneypulled ahead ( so to speak ) with a series of statements and commercials thatstretched the limits . 
Obama 's average also got worse - and was nothing to beproud of.In the end , Romney finished with an average ranking of 2.4 Pinocchios , comparedwith 2.11 for <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> . 
Not counting debates ( when we awarded no Pinocchios ) , werated 92 statements by <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> and 77 by <PERSON>Romney</PERSON> - as well as more than 200 claimsmade by surrogates and interest groups , as well as other <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> candidates . 
Amongthe primary aspirants , Rep. <PERSON>Michele Bachmann</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION> ) finished with the worstrating overall of any candidate - an average of 3.08 Pinocchios.Here are some of the lowlights of the <DATE>2012</DATE> campaign.Most Absurd ' Fact ' - Republican versionFormer <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON>Newt Gingrich</PERSON> 's claim that <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> never got a breakfrom the " elite media " as an actor . 
As an example , <PERSON>Gingrich</PERSON> said only one ofReagan 's movies - " King 's Row " - got a good review from the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Times.First , <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> was a Democrat when he was in show business , so <ORGANIZATION>Gingrich</ORGANIZATION> 's pointwas nonsensical . 
Second , four of <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> 's top 10 movies got raves from the <ORGANIZATION>NewYork Times</ORGANIZATION> - and " King 's Row " was panned.Most Absurd ' Fact ' - Democratic versionMaking a pitch for the president 's jobs bill , Vice President <PERSON>Biden</PERSON> repeatedlyclaimed that incidents of rape in <LOCATION>Flint</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Mich.</LOCATION> , had tripled after the policeforce was cut , as part of a dubious argument that there was a connection betweenthe crime rate and the number of police . 
He even asserted that rapes and othercrime would increase if the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> did not vote for the jobs bill . 
But you need tohave your facts straight if you are going to make incendiary charges . 
Weinvestigated , and it turned out that incidents of rape in <LOCATION>Flint</LOCATION> actually fellafter the number of police was cut.Worst Super PAC Ad - Republican versionA pro-Gingrich super PAC released a 29-minute video titled " King of <ORGANIZATION>Bain</ORGANIZATION> , " whichportrayed Romney as a greedy job killer ruining the lives of Americans . 
Itforeshadowed the <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> attacks on <ORGANIZATION>Romney</ORGANIZATION> 's record as chief of <ORGANIZATION>Bain Capital</ORGANIZATION> , butit was so over the top that it made many of those later ads seem tame . 
One " casestudy " featured selectively edited footage of interviews of workers , who latersaid they were misled about the purpose of the film . 
They actually had nocomplaints about Romney or <ORGANIZATION>Bain</ORGANIZATION> at all.Worst Super PAC Ad - Democratic versionPriorities <ORGANIZATION>USA Action</ORGANIZATION> , a pro-Obama group , aired a provocative ad that suggestedRomney was responsible for the cancer death of the wife of a former steelworkerwho had lost his health insurance . 
But it turned out she died from cancer fiveyears after the closure of the plant - and had her own health insurance for aperiod after the steelworker , <PERSON>Joe Soptic</PERSON> , lost his job . 
As we put it , " On justevery level , this ad stretches the bounds of common sense and decency . 
" Silliest Blooper - Republican versionUntil we highlighted this claim , <PERSON>Romney</PERSON> had made this line a regular staple ofhis campaign stump speech : " We are the only people on the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> that put ourhand over our heart during the playing of the national anthem . " 
We easilydisproved this by randomly searching YouTube and finding numerous examples ofsports figures and schoolchildren from around the world placing their hands ontheir hearts during the playing of their national anthems . 
Apparently , Romneywas trying to ding <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> for once failing to do so during the <DATE>2008</DATE> campaign , buthis belief in American exceptionalism was misplaced.Silliest Blooper - Democratic versionObama 's claim that President <PERSON>Rutherford B. Hayes</PERSON> was so adverse to new ideasthat he had asked of the telephone : " Who would ever use one ? " 
It turns out thatthe 19th president was such an advocate of new technology that he not onlythought the telephone was " wonderful " but also installed the first one inWashington , in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> , just four months after it was introduced . 
Histelephone number was " 1 . 
" Most Baseless Claim - Republican versionThe repeated claim that <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> said that government , not people , built successfulbusinesses . 
The truncated quote " you did n't build that , " drawn from a late-nightrally with ungrammatical phrasing by <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> , became the basis of repeated attackads and even the first night of the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> convention . 
But any fair reading ofObama 's comments showed he was making a standard Democratic argument aboutcommunity success - and that " that " referred to roads and bridges.Most Baseless Claim - Democratic versionSen . 
<PERSON>Harry M. Reid</PERSON> 's repeated claim , made with zero evidence , that <PERSON>Romney</PERSON> " had n't paid any taxes for 10 years . " 
The <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> Democrat said he knew this wastrue because a person who had invested with <ORGANIZATION>Bain Capital</ORGANIZATION> had called his officeand told him this " fact . " 
We could n't find a single expert who thought there wasany credibility to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> majority leader 's reckless claim . 
Romneyeventually released a summary prepared by his accountants showing he had paidfederal and state taxes in each of the past 20 years.Claim That Would Not Die - Republican versionNearly two years ago , we looked deeply at <ORGANIZATION>Romney</ORGANIZATION> 's claim that <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> had gone onan " apology tour " as a new president - and we found no evidence to back up theassertion . 
Yet a version of that claim appeared in almost every speech by theRepublican nominee , and <PERSON>Romney</PERSON> defended it in the final presidential debate.Then his campaign cut a new ad from his remarks , skillfully snipping out thefact that Romney incorrectly said the offending speeches were made in the MiddleEast.Claim That Would Not Die - Democratic versionThe <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> campaign repeatedly asserted that <PERSON>Romney</PERSON> , while at <ORGANIZATION>Bain Capital</ORGANIZATION> , hadoutsourced jobs to foreign countries such as <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> and had also sent jobs toIndia as governor of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> . 
The evidence was slim , at best , and oftenturned on obscure issues as whether Romney still ran <ORGANIZATION>Bain Capital</ORGANIZATION> while taking aleave to manage the <ORGANIZATION>Winter Olympics</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Salt Lake City</LOCATION> . 
Few non-facts everreceived as much ink and television time . 
' Mediscare ' - Republican versionRepublicans initially claimed that <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> raided <MONEY>$ 500 billion</MONEY> from Medicare tofund the health-care law - a figure that later jumped to more than <MONEY>$ 700</MONEY> billionfor arcane budget reasons . 
But these were reductions in projected spending , mainly aimed at providers , and would not affect traditional Medicare benefits.Moreover , Republicans had adopted virtually the same " cuts " in their ownbudgets . 
' Mediscare ' - Democratic versionDemocrats repeatedly charged that seniors would pay <MONEY>$ 6,400</MONEY> extra a year inMedicare premiums under the overhaul plan promoted by <ORGANIZATION>Romney</ORGANIZATION> 's running mate , Rep. <PERSON>Paul Ryan</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>Wis.</LOCATION> ) . 
But this was a figure far in the future , based on anearly and less-generous version of the plan . 
A recent study of the " premiumsupport " model suggested any actual increase in premiums would be far less.Worst Math Skills - Republican versionRomney 's math showing how he would add 12 million jobs in his first term aspresident . 
He cited three studies , which collectively added up to 12 millionjobs , but the studies had 10-year time frames , not four . 
Moreover , two of thestudies did not even evaluate <PERSON>Romney</PERSON> 's own plans.Worst Math Skills - Democratic versionObama 's claim that " <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> " of the current deficit is due to <PERSON>PresidentGeorge W. Bush</PERSON> 's policies , such as the wars in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> . 
Obamacertainly inherited a mess , but any reasonable accounting showed that as histerm wore on , <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's policies increasingly were responsible for the deficit . 
Byour estimate , by <DATE>2011</DATE> , about <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT> was due to <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's policies . 
Bush ' spolicies were responsible for about <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> , and the rest was due to therecession and forecasting errors.A ' Plan ' That Does n't Exist - Democratic versionThe <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> campaign claimed that Romney would raise taxes on the middle class by <MONEY>$ 2,500</MONEY> . 
This was based on a nonpartisan study trying to figure out how Romneycould cut tax rates by <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> but still make his tax plan revenue-neutral . 
The study concluded that eventually the elimination of tax deductions for thewealthy would also affect the middle class . 
So Romney 's math may not have addedup , but he never had a plan to raise taxes.A ' Plan ' That Does n't Exist - Republican versionThe Romney campaign countered that attack by charging that , instead , <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> wouldraise taxes by <MONEY>$ 4,000</MONEY> on the middle class . 
This was also based on a study , whichcalculated the distribution of the debt burden on Americans . 
Obama 's budget fellin a middle range , and <ORGANIZATION>Romney</ORGANIZATION> 's budget would probably have a similar effect . 
Butthis was not evidence of a planned tax increase . 
Far from it.Most Complex Subject to Spin - bipartisan effortThe <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> administration 's memo saying it would accept welfare waivers relatedto worker participation targets prompted bipartisan spinning . 
The Romneycampaign aired an over-the-top ad that accused <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> of gutting the welfarereform law , even though no waivers have yet been issued . 
But the Democraticcounterspin was also questionable , leaving largely unanswered what theadministration hoped to accomplish with the new rules.kesslerg@washpost.comTo read previous Fact Checker columns , go to washingtonpost.com/factchecker .
