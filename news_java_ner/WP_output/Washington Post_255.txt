Sponsor : Swift Boat Veterans for TruthImages : The camera closes in on a black-and-white photograph of <PERSON>John F. Kerrytestifying</PERSON> at a <DATE>1971</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> hearing as his words appear on the screen andveterans , filmed in color , criticize him.Time : 60 secondsAudio : <PERSON>JOHN KERRY</PERSON> : They had personally raped , cut off ears , cut off heads ... JOE PONDER : The accusations that <PERSON>John Kerry</PERSON> made against the veterans who servedin <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> was just devastating . 
KERRY : ... randomly shot at civilians . . . PONDER : ... and it hurt me more than any physical wounds I had . 
KERRY : ... cut offlimbs , blown up bodies ... <PERSON>KEN CORDIER</PERSON> : That was part of the torture , to sign astatement that you had committed war crimes . 
KERRY : . . . razed villages in afashion reminiscent of Genghis Khan ... <PERSON>PAUL GALANTI</PERSON> : <PERSON>John Kerry</PERSON> gave the enemyfor free what I and many of my comrades in the North Vietnamese prison campstook torture to avoid saying . 
It demoralized us . 
KERRY : ... crimes committed ona day-to-day basis ... CORDIER : He betrayed us in the past , how could we beloyal to him now ? 
KERRY : . . . ravaged the countryside of <LOCATION>South Vietnam</LOCATION> ... GALANTI : He dishonored his country and , more importantly , the people he servedwith . 
He just sold them out.Analysis : <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> 's testimony after returning from <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> helped launch hispolitical career and is certainly fair game for a negative ad . 
He was a leaderof <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> Veterans Against the War and had just led a major <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> protestagainst the conflict . 
The strength of this spot , by the independent group thathas roiled the campaign by accusing the senator of lying about his militaryrecord , is that it uses <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> 's own words and voice.But <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> 's testimony is selectively edited in a way that is misleading . 
Hebegan by talking about a conference in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> <DATE>several months earlier</DATE> in whichsome of the 150 veterans told him stories of atrocities . 
" They told the storiesat times they had personally raped , cut off ears , cut off heads , " <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> said , but the ad deletes the first six words , making it sound as though <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> isoffering a firsthand account instead of reporting on what was dubbed the " WinterSoldier " investigation . 
Swift boat veteran <PERSON>John E. O'Neill</PERSON> says the ad is " veryfair " because <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> was describing crimes committed on a day-to-day basis withthe knowledge of officers at all levels of command and " there 's no way to putthe whole speech in . 
" Some of the atrocities <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> described have been documented , such as at the MyLai massacre , and others remain in dispute . 
While <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> 's testimony angered manyveterans , he portrayed himself as speaking out on behalf of disaffected vets , not attacking them.By using <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> 's testimony , the group avoids the credibility issues raised byits first attack spot in which some veterans have given inconsistent accounts ofthe candidate 's military record .
