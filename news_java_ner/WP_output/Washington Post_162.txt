President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> toured the <ORGANIZATION>Standing Rock Sioux Reservation</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> onFriday , marking his first visit to Indian country since his <DATE>2008</DATE> campaign - andhis first since signing two bills into law that were in large part aimed atbetter protecting Native American women from violent crimes on tribal lands.Both laws - the Tribal Law and Order Act , signed in <DATE>2010</DATE> , and the ViolenceAgainst Women Act ( <ORGANIZATION>VAWA</ORGANIZATION> ) , which passed <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and was signed into law lastyear - give tribal justice systems more power in prosecuting and sentencingviolent offenders on reservations , where gaps in the federal law had made NativeAmerican communities havens for criminals for decades . 
The reason : Tribalprosecutors were barred from prosecuting crimes by non-Native Americanoffenders.Tribal leaders , citing statistics that show one in three Native American womenare assaulted or raped in their lifetimes and three in five are victims ofdomestic violence , backed the <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> administration 's push for both laws . 
Formany , the fact that most victims reported their attackers were not NativeAmerican made the push especially urgent.At an annual powwow in <LOCATION>Cannon Ball</LOCATION> , a small community that straddles NorthDakota and <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> on <DATE>Friday</DATE> noted work in enhancing tribal courts ' authority , saying his administration had made more progress in closing justicegaps than any other in history - " particularly when it comes to criminalsentencing and prosecuting people who commit violence against women . " 
" Let 's put our minds together to advance justice because , like every American , you deserve to live safely in your communities , " he said.Even with the new laws , however , the wait for justice for native womencontinues , in part because <ORGANIZATION>VAWA</ORGANIZATION> wo n't take effect until next year on mostreservations , including the <ORGANIZATION>Standing Rock Sioux Reservation</ORGANIZATION> . 
Tribes also arerequired to have implemented a series of steps , some of which could pose largelegal costs.One , for example , includes ensuring that tribal judges have appropriatecredentials they might not already have , said <PERSON>Troy Eid</PERSON> , a former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorneyfor <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> who this past year chaired the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> 's Indian Law andOrder <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> . 
" It 's going to be a while before these changes take place on many reservations , " he said . 
" And there is going to be a lot of waiting while these issues unfold . 
" One of those waiting is <PERSON>Willetta Dolphus</PERSON> , who runs a women 's shelter , the <ORGANIZATION>PrettyBird Woman House</ORGANIZATION> , on the <ORGANIZATION>Standing Rock Sioux Reservation</ORGANIZATION> . 
She says she is n'tsure when the women she serves will even see the effects of the <ORGANIZATION>VAWA</ORGANIZATION> ' sprotections . 
She also notes that the perceived threat of violence is rising inher area , where the region 's energy boom has brought an influx of oil workersand man camps to the plains of the <LOCATION>Dakotas</LOCATION> . 
" We 're anxiously waiting and just wish it did n't take so long , " <PERSON>Dolphus</PERSON> said . 
" But we 're glad there 's work in place , also . 
We got some hope anyway . 
" Beyond the wait for the law 's start date , there are other hurdles for nearly allthe 566 federally recognized tribes . 
" What <ORGANIZATION>VAWA</ORGANIZATION> covers and what tribes can execute in terms of their statutes isreally , really narrow , " Eid said.VAWA , for example , requires that a victim and her assailant know each other , beyond a first encounter , and a tribal prosecutor must be able to prove thisbeyond a reasonable doubt , Eid said.Also , some 200 <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Native</ORGANIZATION> tribes and villages were excluded from the lawbecause of political opposition within the state and on an apparent technicality - the term " Indian country " used in the language of <ORGANIZATION>VAWA</ORGANIZATION> is not a legal termthat applies to all <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Native lands.Juana Majel-Dixon</ORGANIZATION> , who holds a traditional appointment on the Pauma Band ofLuiseÃ ± o Indians legislative council and leads the <ORGANIZATION>National Congress</ORGANIZATION> of AmericanIndians task force on addressing violence against women , is especially concernedabout <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> . 
" The exclusion of <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> villages from the definition of Indian country putsthem at a great disadvantage with their public safety , and especially for womenand children , " she said . " 
[ <ORGANIZATION>VAWA</ORGANIZATION> ] has to be amended . 
" The findings of the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> commission , chaired by Eid , agreed thatthe state 's native villages , many of which are only reachable by plane and facesome of the most dire law enforcement disparities in the country , should havethe expanded legal authority under <ORGANIZATION>VAWA</ORGANIZATION> . 
Crime rates are 10 times higher thanthe rest of the country , the commission said in a report released in November.According to the Indian Law and <ORGANIZATION>Order Commission</ORGANIZATION> 's report , at least 75communities do not have any law enforcement presence , and there is just onewomen 's shelter among all of the villages , which lie hundreds of miles apart insome cases . 
<ORGANIZATION>Alaska Native</ORGANIZATION> women make up less than <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of the state ' spopulation but nearly half of the reported rape victims.Getting <LOCATION>Alaska</LOCATION> included in the law is a priority this year for the <ORGANIZATION>NationalCongress of American Indians</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Majel-Dixon</PERSON> said . 
Its membership of triballeadership and advocates met in <LOCATION>Anchorage</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> . 
" We 're pushing a national platform that highlights the needs of <ORGANIZATION>Alaska Nativewomen</ORGANIZATION> , " Majel-Dixon added . 
" We 're saying it 's on .
