Well , that must have been better than sweeping the Grammys : <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> , innocent on all counts . 
In the end , the erstwhile King of Pop showed he stillhas some moves , dominating prosecutor <PERSON>Tom Sneddon</PERSON> the way he used to dominatelesser rivals on the charts . 
I guess when you 're the guy who made " Thriller , " you get the benefit of the doubt.And the remarkable thing is that it was n't even close . 
By giving <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> a cleansweep , the salt-of-the-earth jurors of <LOCATION>Santa Maria</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> , made clear theirrejection of the prosecution 's entire case . 
No conspiracy , no lewd acts , noteven white wine disguised in soda cans and offered to pubescent boys as " Jesusjuice . 
" Now , I guess , <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> 's life can get back to normal -- parties for kids atNeverland , footraces between the amusement park and the private zoo , thedesignation of one boy as <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> 's special friend for a few weeks or a fewmonths , and , of course , the sleepovers.Sorry , <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> fans , but as you 've probably gathered , the guy still creeps meout . 
I would n't let an adolescent son of mine spend the night in his bedroom , and I hope , perhaps vainly , that one salutary outcome of the trial is that otherparents wo n't either.In retrospect , the problem with the prosecution 's case was that it was weak inthe specific but strong in the general . 
At issue was the question of whetherJackson molested and corrupted with alcohol one young man and conspired to whiskhis family off to forced exile in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> . 
But the family was , frankly , flaky inthe extreme . 
Their history of telling the truth was spotty , to say the least.That was why prosecutor <PERSON>Sneddon</PERSON> fought so hard to introduce the testimony ofpast alleged victims , and that testimony was , to my ears , devastating . 
It washard to escape the conclusion that there was a troubling pattern of behaviorhere -- a middle-aged man inviting a succession of boys for sleepovers , showing them skin mags , finally paying them off with multimillion-dollarsettlements when they threatened to file charges.But there 's no charge of " first-degree faux-juvenile dirty-old-man weirdness " inthe <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> penal code , and the jury found reasonable doubt on the specificcharges . 
<PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> was acquitted and may now don his single glove and walk ormoonwalk to freedom.If , indeed , you can call it freedom . 
From all accounts , <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> is in somethingof a financial prison , spending <MONEY>$ 1 million</MONEY> a month on Neverland while his recordsales languish . 
His valuable music catalogue assets are mortgaged to the hilt , and now he has defense lawyer <PERSON>Tom Mesereau</PERSON> 's bills to pay . 
Not to mention theumbrella-holder guy who escorted him to court every day.For a man who had just avoided a lengthy term in prison , he looked surprisinglygrim leaving the courthouse . 
Maybe he was thinking of the civil suit hisaccuser 's family will no doubt soon file , and he 's smart enough to know there ' sa much lesser standard of proof in civil court . 
This case will continue to beexpensive for him , one way or another.But <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> is nothing if not resilient . 
I predict a comeback album andtour , coming soon to an arena near you.I 've written in the past that the spectacle of <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> on trial was irredeemablysad , and that 's still true . 
Just the other day , shopping in an internationalfood market not far from my house that has an unusually high class of backgroundmusic , I heard the old Jackson 5 hit " ABC " and was reminded again howpreternaturally confident and polished <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> 's singing was , how energetic , howfresh . 
He was the personification of youthful promise.I 've also written that whatever happened at <LOCATION>Neverland</LOCATION> , the parents of the youngboys who shared <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> 's bed deserved a good measure of blame , and they stilldo . 
But why do I have the depressing feeling that there are other star-struck , emotionally and financially desperate families out there ready to take theirplace?If so , has this trial accomplished anything ? 
I think it has . 
At least we knowthat beneath the childlike exterior , there 's a shrewd and calculating man . 
Weknow that the image of <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> as an aging , asexual <PERSON>Peter Pan</PERSON> is a lie . 
We knowthat , surrounded by his paid acolytes and his paid " friends " and his graspingfamily , <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> is one lonely man.He 's not guilty on all charges . 
But I 'll never look at him quite the same wayagain , and I suspect that you wo n't either.The author will be available to answer questions at <TIME>2 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> on www.washingtonpost.com .
