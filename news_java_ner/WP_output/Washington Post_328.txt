<MONEY>$ 35</MONEY> It 's been said that <PERSON>Lewis Carroll</PERSON> ' spaired classics -- <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> 's Adventures in Wonderland ( <DATE>1865</DATE> ) and its slightly moreprogrammatic sequel , Through the Looking-Glass ( 1872 ) -- are , after the <PERSON>Bibleand Shakespeare</PERSON> , the most quoted books in English . 
" Curiouser and curiouser , " " Drink Me , " " Who are you ? " 
" The different branches of Arithmetic -- Ambition , Distraction , Uglification , and Derision , " " Off with her head ! " 
Such phrasesinstantly call to mind Wonderland and characters like the Mad Hatter and <PERSON>theMarch Hare</PERSON> , the <LOCATION>Cheshire</LOCATION> Cat , the <ORGANIZATION>Caterpillar</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Queen of Hearts</ORGANIZATION> . 
Were one tolist the most beloved novels in the world , the two <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> fantasies would likelygrab the top spot.Yet as Will <PERSON>Brooker</PERSON> points out in this revealing though somewhat scattershotstudy , <PERSON>Lewis Carroll</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> possess dual identities in the popularimagination . 
Carroll , or rather <PERSON>Charles L. Dodgson</PERSON> , is the eccentric , shy andstammering Oxford don with a kind heart , a flair for mathematical and linguisticpuzzles and an old bachelor 's prissy affection for children . 
That 's thetraditional view and , to my mind , still largely the true one . 
But some modernreaders and critics take <PERSON>Dodgson</PERSON> as little better than a pedophile , a depravedHumbert Humbert who proposed marriage to 11-year-old <PERSON>Alice Liddell</PERSON> ( model andinspiration for the fictional Alice ) and snakily convinced mothers to allow himto photograph their pubescent daughters in risqu√© poses , or even in the nude.Similarly , <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> has been portrayed as both a polite , strong-minded butessentially innocent and well brought-up young lady -- and as a proto-Goth , witha taste for drugs and danger , half <LOCATION>Lolita</LOCATION> , half <PERSON>Lara Croft</PERSON> . 
Somehow theseconflicting images co-exist in our minds these days , and <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> 's Adventures aimsto examine how this is possible and what it means.Will <PERSON>Brooker</PERSON> 's earlier studies examined the " Star Wars " movies and Batman comicsas cultural properties , in particular as the focus of fan communities . 
Thisyoungish British professor of communications himself represents the current beauideal of cultural studies -- smart , theoretically sophisticated and widely readin traditional literature , yet most deeply fascinated by the zeitgeist ofcomputer games , web sites and blogs , movies , TV shows , pop songs and graphicnovels . 
Clearly of his time , our spike-haired lad tells us that he generallysports " a black military jacket and biker boots " and totes a rucksack , cellphone , <LOCATION>Palm Pilot</LOCATION> and water bottle . 
I suppose the look is n't really thatdifferent from a 19th-century scholar 's gown and mortarboard -- and I wouldguess that <PERSON>Brooker</PERSON> is a terrific teacher . 
As it is , he grounds his critical workin shrewd common sense , writes clearly ( even a bit stiffly ) and explores animpressive range of <PERSON>Carroll</PERSON> and Alice-related phenomena -- biographies , newspaper articles , novels , films , computer games , new editions of the books , tourist sites and fan groups.To better focus his research , <PERSON>Brooker</PERSON> largely restricts himself to the <DATE>1990s</DATE> , anunusually rich period for Alice materials . 
For instance , he surveys eightbiographical works , including <PERSON>Karoline Leach</PERSON> 's controversial In the Shadow ofthe <ORGANIZATION>Dreamchild</ORGANIZATION> , a study that tries to prove that <PERSON>Dodgson</PERSON> was using visits toAlice and her sisters as a cover for an affair with their mother . 
He discussesHelen <PERSON>Oxenbury</PERSON> 's illustrations as a successful attempt to portray Alice as acontemporary child while reaffirming her traditional wholesome image . 
He pointsout <PERSON>Gilbert Adair</PERSON> 's successful emulation of <ORGANIZATION>Carroll</ORGANIZATION> 's style -- down to the keyuse of italics -- in his novel Alice Through the Needle 's Eye . 
He praisesJonathan <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> 's made-for-TV movie " Alice in Wonderland " and , in particular , its imaginative association of the fantasy with the nostalgic glow ofWordsworth 's " Immortality Ode " : The film opens by describing a world with all " the glory and the freshness of a dream " and closes with the most melancholyline of English Romantic poetry , " The things which I have seen I now can see nomore . " 
But then <PERSON>Brooker</PERSON> also spends a long chapter on the third-person , animatedshooter game " Dark Wonderland , " with its psychologically tormented , sexuallyprovocative , knife-wielding heroine . 
In his last chapter he visits <ORGANIZATION>EuroDisney</ORGANIZATION> ' sAlice attractions , several kitschy or neglected tourist sites and <PERSON>Dodgson</PERSON> ' sOxford.All these manifestations of <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> are worthy of study , but my favorite sectionof <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> 's Adventures is that devoted to the <ORGANIZATION>Lewis Carroll Society</ORGANIZATION> . 
I think thatanyone who belongs to a literary society or fan club -- whether one devoted toBuffy or <PERSON>William Faulkner</PERSON> , <PERSON>Jane Austen</PERSON> or the Sandman -- will recognize theaptness of <PERSON>Brooker</PERSON> 's analysis and the accuracy of his reporting : " A key appealof fan groups is the sense of being part of a community , of sharing anenthusiasm with others who will understand . " 
He notes that <PERSON>Lewis Carroll Societymembers</PERSON> " tend to talk and write like <PERSON>Lewis Carroll</PERSON> . " 
Members gain respect andrank by their knowledge of textual minutiae , by their connoisseurship . 
Not onlythe <ORGANIZATION>Lewis Carroll Society</ORGANIZATION> , but all such groups like to visit " geographical sitesassociated with the author , actor , film series , singer or saga of interest . 
" Devotion sometimes approaches the religious . 
Distant relatives or minor actorswill be treated reverently , as links to the venerated icon . 
Role-playingfrequently occurs at annual dinners or conventions , and there are attempts toreproduce meals , costumes and activities that are essentially Carrollian ( orSherlockian , Chestertonian or Wodehousian ) . 
Not least , such sodalities work hardat curatorship and advocacy , establishing texts , promoting scholarship , spreading the word and sometimes setting guards against vulgar outsiders.Finally , the members are sensitive to being misjudged -- by the press , above all -- as cultists , nuts or eccentrics.Alice 's Adventures makes a good companion to <PERSON>Robert Phillips</PERSON> 's classic anthologyAspects of <ORGANIZATION>Alice</ORGANIZATION> , which covers the essentials of Wonderland scholarship betweenthe <DATE>1860s</DATE> and <DATE>1960s</DATE> . 
It also complements <PERSON>Martin Gardner</PERSON> 's celebrated AnnotatedAlice , recently published in a " Definitive Edition . " 
But the world of Alice istruly resistant to any reductionism : These are texts so rich that they cansupport every sort of critical investigation ( or pseudo-critical indignity ) andyet still remain ever fresh . 
" We can see now , " writes <PERSON>Brooker</PERSON> , " that the psychoanalytic interpretations ofthe Alice books in the <DATE>1930s</DATE> were a product of a specific moment and movement , and the same is now obvious for the <DATE>1960s</DATE> psychedelic readings . 
The discoursesthat I traced in <DATE>1990s</DATE> journalism and in some biographies , that <PERSON>Carroll</PERSON> wasemotionally arrested , a repressed paedophile , an obsessive , stammering socialreject , a starched control freak , or a photographic voyeur -- and yet that hislegacy is an innocent , timeless , very English work of charming fantasy , suitablefor reissue to another generation of young readers -- have more to do with ourown attitudes to childhood and celebrity than they do to the culture Carrolllived through . 
" At the end of <ORGANIZATION>Alice</ORGANIZATION> 's Adventures , after the transvestite web sites and thecomputer shoot 'em ups and the tawdry gift shoppes , <PERSON>Brooker</PERSON> finally makes hisway to the city of <LOCATION>Guildford</LOCATION> : " The cemetery was almost silent ; no people , just asoft bird trill and the wind rustling through willow . 
I found the grave easilyand sat beside it . 
' Thy will be done , ' reads the inscription on the horizontalof the white cross . 
At the base : ' Rev. <PERSON>Charles Lutwidge Dodgson</PERSON> ( <PERSON>Lewis Carroll</PERSON> ) Fell Asleep <DATE>Jan 14 1898</DATE> . ' 
Asleep , to dream . 
" It is somehow pleasingly Wonderlandish to imagine <PERSON>Brooker</PERSON> -- looking , as he oncetells us , more like a bouncer or security guard than a scholar -- payingreverent , if somewhat unexpected homage to this most elusive genius of Englishliterature .
