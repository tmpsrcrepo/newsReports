It 's almost enough to give socialism a bad name.We do n't know whether <PERSON>Dominique Strauss-Kahn</PERSON> - who heads the InternationalMonetary Fund and , until a few days ago , was likely to be the Socialist Partycandidate for president of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> - is guilty of the alleged sexual assault forwhich he was arrested . 
Like anyone , he is presumed innocent until courtproceedings prove otherwise.We do know , however , that at the time of the reported incident on Saturday,Strauss-Kahn was resident in a <MONEY>$ 3,000-a-night</MONEY> luxury suite at a posh midtownManhattan hotel . 
We also know that when he was taken into police custody hourslater , aboard a Paris-bound jetliner that was moments from takeoff at <LOCATION>John F.Kennedy International Airport</LOCATION> , police found him comfortably ensconced in thefirst-class cabin.I did n't think this was how socialists were supposed to roll.The tinge of opulent decadence that colors the whole episode would seem , atfirst impression , to cast a dishonorable light on powerful , unaccountable,jet-setting international bureaucrats in general , with perhaps a specialspotlight of shame for the French-intellectual variety . 
But <PERSON>Strauss-Kahn</PERSON> , who isbased at <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , was apparently in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> on privatebusiness . 
It is conceivable that he and his peers , while carrying out theirofficial duties on behalf of humanity , make do with hotel rooms costing less pernight than most workers of the world earn in a year.Then again , had it been an <ORGANIZATION>IMF</ORGANIZATION> trip , <PERSON>Strauss-Kahn</PERSON> would have been covered bydiplomatic immunity - and thus , perhaps , might have avoided the indignity ofbeing held overnight in the Special Victims Unit lockup while detectivessearched his person for potential DNA evidence . 
He almost certainly would havebeen spared the handcuffed " perp walk " before a frenzied scrum of photographersas he was transferred to court for arraignment.It 's hard to look at <PERSON>Strauss-Kahn</PERSON> 's predicament without a sense of irony andperhaps a touch of schadenfreude . 
There is nothing remotely amusing , however , about the alleged assault - which , I should note , his attorney categoricallydenies.Whatever happened took place at the <ORGANIZATION>Sofitel</ORGANIZATION> , one of the sleeker of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> ' supper-echelon hotels . 
A 32-year-old female housekeeper - according to publishedreports , an African immigrant - entered <PERSON>Strauss-Kahn</PERSON> 's suite to clean up , believing the guest had already departed . 
In her account , <PERSON>Strauss-Kahn</PERSON> emergednaked from the bathroom . 
She apologized and tried to leave , but Strauss-Kahnallegedly blocked her way , accosted her in the suite 's bedroom and then sexuallyassaulted her in the bathroom.The housekeeper reported the alleged attack to her supervisors , but by the timepolice were called , <PERSON>Strauss-Kahn</PERSON> had checked out . 
He later called the hotel tosay that he believed he had left his cellphone behind , however , and , accordingto published reports , a fast-thinking hotel employee told him - falsely - thatthe phone had been found and asked where it could be delivered . 
This isapparently how authorities learned he was at <LOCATION>JFK</LOCATION> , waiting to board an <ORGANIZATION>Air Franceflight</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> . 
Airport police swooped in and made the arrest as the jetprepared to push back from the gate.Strauss-Kahn 's arrest had immediate and far-reaching impact . 
The most definitiveseemed to be the extinction of his political career - and with it , perhaps , thebest chance the <ORGANIZATION>Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION> might have had of defeating President NicolasSarkozy in next year 's election . 
A perp-walk photo is the kind of thing nopolitician recovers from . 
Well , no politician except former <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> mayor MarionBarry.And the arrest came amid delicate , complicated and urgent negotiations to rescuethe <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> 's most threatened economies . 
Strauss-Kahn was a key figure inthe ongoing talks , and while others can pick up where he leaves off , thefinancial markets could be unnerved by his sudden absence.Commentators in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> expressed shock , outrage and embarrassment . 
Even if <LOCATION>theNew York</LOCATION> allegations turn out not to be true , the incident revived memories ofan admittedly improper affair that <PERSON>Strauss-Kahn</PERSON> had with a subordinate . 
Frenchnewspapers quickly produced stories recounting what they described asStrauss-Kahn 's long history of aggressive , obnoxious , even predatory behaviortoward women.It 's useful to be reminded that there was a time when powerful men could expectsuch incidents to be dismissed as misunderstandings or indiscretions orpeccadilloes , not prosecuted as criminal assaults . 
Yes , this sounds like the ageof the dinosaurs . 
<PERSON>Dominique Strauss-Kahn</PERSON> gives every evidence of being one.The writer will answer questions at <TIME>1 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> at www.washingtonpost.com .
