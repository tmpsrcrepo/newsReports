Anyone who was shocked by the most recent revelations of sexual misconduct byUnited Nations staff has never set foot in a U.N.-sponsored refugee camp . 
Sexcrimes are only one especially disturbing symptom of a culture of abuse thatexists in the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> precisely because the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> and its stafflack accountability.This lack of accountability is the central blemish on today 's <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> , and it lies behind most of the recent headlines . 
Whether taking advantage of amalnourished refugee or of a lucrative oil-for-food contract , the temptation isthere , the act is easy and the risk of punishment is nil.I arrived in <LOCATION>Sierra Leone</LOCATION> as a legal aid worker in the <DATE>summer of 2003</DATE> , one yearafter the release of a damaging report on sexual abuse in <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> refugee camps inWest <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> . 
Although the report 's description of widespread sexual abuse hadprompted Secretary General <PERSON>Kofi Annan</PERSON> to issue a strongly worded " zerotolerance " policy , I found abuse of a sexual nature almost every day -- zerocompliance with zero tolerance , as one investigator was to write . 
U.N. leadershad simply not expended any effort beyond lip service to carry out this zerotolerance policy.In fact , abuse at these camps went beyond sexual violations : Injustices of onesort or another were perpetrated by <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> missions or their affiliatednongovernmental organizations every day in the camps I visited . 
Corruption wasthe norm , in particular the embezzlement of food and funds by <ORGANIZATION>NGO</ORGANIZATION> officials , which often left camp resources dangerously inadequate . 
Utterly arbitraryjudicial systems in the camps subjected refugees to violent physical punishmentor months in prison for trivial offenses -- all at the whim of officials andin the absence of any sort of hearing.I became especially involved in the plight of 11 young Liberian men from theTobanda refugee camp near <LOCATION>Kenema</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Sierra Leone</PERSON> . 
They had been arrested andimprisoned , without trial , by the U.N.-sponsored camp management . 
Theaccusation : stealing plastic tarps . 
The refugee youths had received permissionfrom camp management to use surplus tarps for housing , but they had not beengiven explicit permission to do so by officials of the Office of the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. HighCommissioner</ORGANIZATION> for Refugees ( <ORGANIZATION>UNHCR</ORGANIZATION> ) . 
The camp 's management later had them arrested by the local authorities , and theyremained in a squalid , inadequate Sierra Leonean state prison , without a formaltrial or any legal representation . 
Of course , the <ORGANIZATION>UNHCR</ORGANIZATION> officer assigned tomonitor refugees in local prisons would be unaware of this fact -- a prisonlog book revealed that he had not visited the prison for several months . 
By thetime the young men were freed they had spent four months in a filthy , dampprison and were suffering from malaria , scabies and malnutrition . 
The prison wasjust yards from the <ORGANIZATION>UNHCR</ORGANIZATION> ( and <ORGANIZATION>UNICEF</ORGANIZATION> ) headquarters in Kenema.This experience was sadly typical for the refugees with whom I worked . 
Althoughcharged with the care of desperate refugees , many of the <ORGANIZATION>UNHCR</ORGANIZATION> staff remainedambivalent or hostile to the basic rights and needs of these vulnerable people.And they acted without fear of consequence.The risk to these staff members is low in <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> refugee camps , becausepeacekeepers engaged in criminal acts are immune from local prosecution.Therefore , local parties seeking justice must travel to the peacekeeper 's homecountry . 
<ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> workers from countries with unresponsive legal systems , or thosecommitting unspectacular crimes , can sleep easy . 
At the same time , local NGOemployees who are contracted by the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> to work in the camps arecovered by a de facto implied immunity . 
That is , if these individuals areidentified as being connected with <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> operations , they will probably neverface charges for their actions by local authorities . 
In <LOCATION>West Africa</LOCATION> , most of thesexual misconduct accusations are leveled against local <ORGANIZATION>NGO</ORGANIZATION> staff members.If the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> is to enjoy such immunity , it is incumbent on theorganization to police itself aggressively and thoroughly . 
Yet the recentstonewalling over a series of scandals from the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> -- fromoil-for-food to a sexual harassment imbroglio involving a high <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> official -- are typical of a bureaucracy dedicated to self-preservation . 
This code ofbehavior travels rapidly down the organizational chart . 
The message is : Coveryour tracks and the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> will obstruct your prosecution.After the <DATE>2002</DATE> report documented sexual abuse , <PERSON>Annan</PERSON> 's steely resolve led toexactly zero criminal prosecutions of <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> officials for sexual abuse . 
I expectlittle difference now that refugee camp conditions have returned to theheadlines . 
As before , <PERSON>Annan</PERSON> has delivered vague statements but prosecuted noone . 
It appears that the status quo reigns and that those perpetrating all sortsof abuses in refugee camps may continue undisturbed . 
The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> is avital institution that needs a housecleaning.The writer is a student at <ORGANIZATION>New York University School of Law</ORGANIZATION> .
