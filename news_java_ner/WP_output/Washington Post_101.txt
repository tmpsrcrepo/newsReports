<PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> could outtalk anybody in that <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> beat cop 's voice of his . 
Butthe lung cancer and the chemo had left him breathless , and what emerged in twodays of conversations with him , the last interview he would give , sounded like aseries of sighs . 
Some of them satisfied , some of them regretful , all of themaware that his life was drawing to a close and 85 years were being relentlesslyand reductively defined . 
Â ¶ <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> studied his own end , and knew it was n'tgoing to be storybook . 
So much for the old-fashioned narrative he had built , ofbookish yet vigorous young men filling a stadium in the Alleghenies , men he haduplifted such as <PERSON>Franco Harris</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lydell Mitchell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brandon Short</PERSON> , autumnleaves swirling softly over their heads . 
Â ¶ " There 's the kind of stories I wishwe could tell , " <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> whispered . 
Â ¶ But a modern grotesquery intervened , andthere were too many other boys who allegedly had been damaged.For most of his 61 years as a football coach at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> built arecord of thorough decency and good intention . 
He loved his wife , reared fivenice children , taught his students well . 
He turned down big money for the roleof a tenured professor , and strolled every day from his modest home to hisunpretentious office . 
He acquired real power , and generally tried not to abuseit , and if sometimes he did , he covered for it by insisting on paying for hisice cream cones . 
He set out to prove that staying in one place could be asrewarding as climbing to the next rung . 
He meant to walk away sooner . 
He stayedtoo long.He stayed so long that he became more of an ideal to his followers than aperson . 
Then the horrific happened , and the quaint success story in the peacefulhamlet was destroyed by allegations that <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky</PERSON> , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's assistantcoach for 30 years , was a serial child molester and that <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> , when told ofan incident involving <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> and a small boy in the <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> showers , didhis duty but no more , passing the report to his superiors . 
The only way to givethe tragedy the gravity it deserved was to topple the icon who behaved sofallibly . 
" You got what you got , " he says he told himself , after he was fired by the boardof trustees in <DATE>November</DATE> . 
" You did about as much as you can do , on the field andoff the field . 
" Yet <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> also understood he was the face of a terrible inaction . 
He had donemore than some people , yet less than he should have when he failed to press hissuperiors about <PERSON>Mike McQueary</PERSON> 's report of seeing <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> doing something sexualto a small boy in the <LOCATION>Lasch</LOCATION> football building . 
" I should have said ' Hey where are we with this thing ? ' " 
<PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> said . 
Hedescribed himself as paralyzed by the unthinkable subject matter . 
He had " backedaway , " he said , and trusted his bosses to handle it . 
" I did n't know which way to go , " he said . 
" And rather than get in there and makea mistake . . . " A week ago , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> invited this reporter into his home because he wanted todefend his record and give his version of events in the <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> case . 
He oftenseemed to be trying to explain his actions to himself as much as to others . 
Itwas a difficult conversation because it was not only his first interview on thesubject of <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> but quite possibly the last interview he would ever give.His health was clearly precarious , and his answers often trailed off orwandered . 
Shortly afterward , he failed badly , and slipped in and out ofconsciousness over the next few days.The enraged who demand hard answers as to why <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> did n't do more will haveto wait until eternity . 
Why did n't he follow up ? 
" I do n't know , " he said.You will have to decide for yourself if <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> could have reached the age of 85in modern society without ever really knowing what man-boy sodomy was . 
" I hadnever heard of , of , rape and a man , " he said.For what it 's worth , there was genuine distress in his voice when he said it.And it 's hard to overstate just how insulated <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> was . 
His home was a timewarp , all old wood and creaking floorboards . 
But he most likely overstated hisignorance . 
He did , after all , belong to a <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> wracked by pedophiliascandals.Still , I thought I understood what he meant . 
He seemed to reflexively recoilfrom such deviancy ; it baffled him , and to connect it to a longtime colleaguewas almost impossible . 
" It was shocking for me , and too , sadness , " <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> said . 
" Was he sick ? 
I do n'tknow . 
I do n't even know if he 's guilty . 
" It would be a mistake to think that <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> did n't care enough about thepotential victims . 
" I 'm sick about it . 
I think about a 12-year-old boy , a10-year old boy . 
In the shower , a physical touching , it 's sickening . 
" According to <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's wife Sue , the two of them spent agonized hours talkingabout whether , if <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> is guilty , they should have noticed something.If nothing else , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> said , maybe the <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> scandal would help drag thesubject out of its dark corner . 
It was one of the last sentiments he expressed.On the final morning he would ever spend at home , he sat propped in bed andinsisted on answering a few more questions - that 's how important it was to himto talk . 
In just a few hours he would be taken to the hospital , and remain thereuntil he died <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> . 
" I 'm happy in one sense that we called attention , throughout this state , andthroughout the country probably , that this is going on , " he said . 
" It 's kind ofbeen like a hidden thing . 
So maybe that 's good . 
" According to a family spokesperson , it was among his last lucid remarks toanyone outside of his immediate family.Paterno 's critics will say his inaction in the <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> case ruined his legacyand that he had the power to do more . 
But <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> denied he was the ultimatemoral authority in <LOCATION>Happy Valley</LOCATION> . 
He had always tried to refrain from flexing hismuscle , he insisted . 
" In all the years I 'm here , we went the way the universitywanted , " he said.One reason I suspect <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> decided to talk with me , as opposed to anotherwriter , was because it brought his career full circle . 
In <DATE>1968</DATE> a SportsIllustrated writer named <PERSON>Dan Jenkins</PERSON> went to <ORGANIZATION>State College</ORGANIZATION> to do _ blanka storyon a rising coach who had turned a cow college into a national football power , yet who emphasized academics like an <ORGANIZATION>Ivy Leaguer</ORGANIZATION> . 
No fewer than five times , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> asked , " How 's your father ? " 
I replied that my father is 82 and stilltyping , and did n't like the idea of retirement either.Back in <DATE>1968</DATE> , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> told my father , " We 're trying to win football games ; do n'tmisunderstand that . 
But I do n't want it to ruin our lives if we lose . 
I do n'twant us ever to become the kind of place where an 8-2 season is a tragedy . 
Lookat that day outside . 
It 's clear , it 's beautiful , the leaves are turning , theland is pretty , and it 's quiet . 
If losing a game made me miserable , I could n'tenjoy such a day . 
" Had that perspective gotten lost ? 
Did <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> feel that somewhere along theline , football had become too important - and somehow allowed a real tragedy togo overlooked ? 
" Well , I do n't think it got lost , " he said . 
" I just think there was a series ofsituations that maybe people , a little bit , maybe they neglected something , andmaybe they got a little bit frustrated . 
Whether they had good intentions or not , you 'd have to ask them . 
" His record will show that he was a great , indomitable champion who amassed arecord 409 victories , as well as an intelligent advocate who worked tirelesslyfor poor and minority athletes his whole career . 
It will show that he wasutterly devoted to his players , regularly graduated more than <PERCENT>75 percent</PERCENT> ofthem , and had 47 academic all-Americans . 
It will show that he made mistakes andomissions , one of them possibly truly costly . 
It will show that he mostlymaintained his perspective and remained true to himself . 
" He did n't preach one thing and live a different way , " Sue said.It will show that he was not a statue made of bronze , and that he was defined asmuch by what he failed to do and say , as by what he did . 
Which merely made him , in the end , human.jenkinss@washpost.comFor <PERSON>Sally Jenkins</PERSON> 's previous columns , go to washingtonpost.com/jenkinsMore from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post SportsAudio excerpts from <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's last interviewSocial media sparks firestorm of false reportsLast week : <PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> speaks to <PERSON>Sally JenkinsPaterno</PERSON> speaks : Complete coverageVideo : Paterno : ' We 've got a problem , I think ' Photos : <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> trustees fire PaternoGraphic : Inside the <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> scandalQ & A transcript : <PERSON>Sally Jenkins</PERSON>
