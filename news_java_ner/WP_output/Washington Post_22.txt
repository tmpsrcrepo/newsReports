For decades , few people noticed that legislators in <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION> had deletedcrucial language from <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> state law in <DATE>1980</DATE> . 
It was n't until a 2003court case that police , to their chagrin , discovered that they could n't preventprostitutes and their customers from engaging in commercial exchange.For the next six years , until legislators corrected their error , the oldestprofession was not a crime in <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> - and public health and public safetysubstantially improved as a result , according to a new working paper from <ORGANIZATION>theNational Bureau of Economic Research</ORGANIZATION> . 
The statewide incidence of gonorrhea amongwomen declined <PERCENT>by39 percent</PERCENT> and the number of rapes reported to police in thestate declined by <PERCENT>31 percent</PERCENT> , according to the paper.The study -- by <ORGANIZATION>Baylor University</ORGANIZATION> 's <PERSON>Scott Cunningham</PERSON> and <PERSON>Manisha Shah</PERSON> of theUniversity of <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> - contributes to an impassioned,long-running debate among advocates for women 's rights about prostitution . 
Theirwork appears to be the first quantitative evidence that removing criminalpenalties for prostitutes can reduce violence against women and curtail sexuallytransmitted infections in society - and dramatically so.Opponents argue that legal prostitution would encourage traffickers to kidnapwomen and girls into lives of sexual slavery . 
Shah and <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> did notexplore this question in their paper due to a lack of data.Operation RubdownLawmakers revised the state statute on prostitution in <DATE>1980</DATE> , concerned that itwas overly broad and could infringe on First Amendment freedoms . 
They went toofar , accidentally removing the section defining the act itself as a crime.Associated activities such as streetwalking , pimping and trafficking remainedillegal.Since prostitutes could n't walk the streets , they had few opportunities to takeadvantage of the mistake until the advent of the Internet gave them another wayto advertise . 
In <DATE>2003</DATE> , police in <LOCATION>Providence</LOCATION> raided two spas in a sting calledOperation Rubdown . 
The women were staying off the street , and a judge ruled intheir favor . 
Legislators revised the law in <DATE>2009</DATE> . 
There are a number of reasons to think that making prostitution legal mightimprove working conditions for prostitutes . 
If they were having a problem with aclient , they could threaten to call the police , reducing the risk of physicalviolence . 
Prostitutes could also demand that their clients use condoms.Additionally , according to supporters of legal prostitution , unlawfulstreetwalkers have no opportunity to vet their clients before their hurried , clandestine encounters . 
A regular market for sex , whether online or in abrick-and-mortar establishment , could solve that problem.Opponents dispute these theories , arguing that prostitution is inherentlyviolent and dangerous , whether legal or not.Shah and <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> did not consider these questions specifically ; instead , theyexamined the consequences of decriminalization for the state as a whole . 
The twoeconomists found that more women , particularly white and Asian women , enteredprostitution and that the price of their services fell . 
In addition to the lowerrate of gonorrhea infections among women , <PERSON>Shah</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> estimated thatdecriminalizing prostitution prevented 824 rapes that would have been otherwisereported to police , and presumably many more that would not have been reportedin any case.The decline in the number of rapes was so large that <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shah</PERSON> feltobliged to examine their data with three separate statistical methods , but theeffect persisted . 
The authors were eventually persuaded that their result wasnot a fluke and that imposing criminal sanctions on prostitutes and theirclients might cause violence against women . 
" The human costs are so big , if thisis in fact a very real causal effect , " <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> said . 
" I think we haveconvinced ourselves that we have done everything we can do to rule outalternative explanations . 
" Is prostitution rape?Possibly the most disturbing and surprising implication of these results is thatmen who commit rape would simply find a prostitute if doing so were lessexpensive . 
<PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shah</PERSON> considered , and ruled out , several other possibleexplanations for the decline in rape . 
The economists wondered , for example , whether police officers working on massage parlor stings had been reassigned torape investigations , but it seemed they had not.Melissa <PERSON>Farley</PERSON> , a feminist , psychologist and trenchant critic of prostitution , argued that <PERSON>Cunningham</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shah</PERSON> simply misunderstood the nature of paid sex.Prostitutes are often victims of abuse , whether it is perpetrated by johns orpimps , she said . 
If so , then the decrease in rapes reported to police does notreally represent a decrease in the total amount of violence . 
" Women in prostitution generally describe it as paid rape . 
That 's what it feelslike to them , " said <PERSON>Farley</PERSON> , who said the study embodies a " reactionaryworldview . 
" Farley , along with major international feminist organizations such as <ORGANIZATION>EqualityNow</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Coalition Against Trafficking</ORGANIZATION> in Women , worried that legalizingprostitution would make it easier for traffickers to operate and that many ofthe new prostitutes who appeared in <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> between <DATE>2003</DATE> and <DATE>2009</DATE> wereunwilling participants . 
" Demand fuels trafficking , " said <PERSON>Kristen Berg</PERSON> , Equality Now 's traffickingprogram officer . 
" With the demand for commercial sex , there 's an incentive fortraffickers to traffic women and girls to these locations . 
" <PERSON>Ronald Weitzer</PERSON> , a sociologist at <ORGANIZATION>George Washington University</ORGANIZATION> , disagreed , arguing that legal prostitution would reduce the financial incentive fororganized crime to risk running afoul of law enforcement by kidnapping andtransporting girls . 
" When something is prohibited , it allows organized crime togain a foothold , " he said , comparing the sex market to the markets for alcoholduring Prohibition or for marijuana and other drugs today.A legal dilemmaA model developed by <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> and copied elsewhere offers a kind of compromise : Prostitutes are not criminals , but their clients are . 
This is the approachfavored by <PERSON>Donna Hughes</PERSON> , a professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Rhode Island</ORGANIZATION> and aneyewitness to the inadvertent decriminalization.Hughes , like <PERSON>Farley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Berg</PERSON> , views prostitutes as victims , not criminals , butshe was forced to make a difficult decision when <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> began to debateamending the law.The Nordic model , as <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> 's regime is known , was a political non-starter inRhode <LOCATION>Island</LOCATION> . 
Hughes , a prominent scholar of trafficking , was forced to choosebetween the status quo and imposing criminal sanctions on prostitutes . 
Sheeventually threw her support to the latter option . 
" The situation was so horrible in <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> that the pimps and traffickerswere operating with absolute impunity , " she said.Hughes 's story shows why the debate over prostitution can become so contentious.In practice , the distinction between criminals and victims is often unclear.Many prostitutes and their advocates dislike both labels . 
They objectstrenuously to the view that they are not in the industry through their ownchoice but through manipulation or coercion . 
" They have heard that , and they laugh at it , " said <PERSON>Mike Kiselica</PERSON> , a Providencelawyer who represented massage parlors and their prostitutes duringdecriminalization . 
" The frontline workers , the girls , they were free to movearound and would do so if one of the other places offered them a more attractiveworking environment or a better clientele , " he said.max.ehrenfreund@washpost.comExcerpted from <LOCATION>Wonkblog</LOCATION> , at washingtonpost.com/wonkblog .
