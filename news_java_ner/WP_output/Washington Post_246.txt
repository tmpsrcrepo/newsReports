The ACC put out a news release <DATE>Friday</DATE> announcing that the league has beenawarded the <DATE>2015</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Naismith Legacy Award</ORGANIZATION> . 
According to the release , the award isgiven each year to individuals and organizations in basketball to " honor theirroles in furthering the values of honor , respect and integrity on and off thecourt . 
" The timing of the announcement was fascinating . 
On the same day , the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> cameabout as close to throwing the book at <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION> - now an <ORGANIZATION>ACC</ORGANIZATION> member - as it evercomes when a big-time program is accused of breaking the rules.Orange Coach <PERSON>Jim Boeheim</PERSON> woke up <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> second on the all-time DivisionI coaching list with 966 wins . 
By lunchtime , he was down to sixth after the NCAAstripped him of 108 wins , some of them dating from the 2004-05 season . 
( Ofcourse , the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> has been known to loudly announce that it is vacating coachingwins and then quietly announce " never mind " a few years later . 
See " Paterno , <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> . " ) 
And with or without those wins , <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> will have to sit out Syracuse ' sfirst nine ACC games next season.The school also will lose three scholarships per year through <DATE>2019</DATE> - a fairlyminor hit since most schools do n't need more than 10 scholarship players - andit will lose money from postseason play and be fined <MONEY>$ 500</MONEY> for every game inwhich an ineligible player was on the court.Syracuse already had announced last month that it was voluntarily banning itselffrom all postseason play this year , meaning it wo n't be around next weekend atthe ACC tournament in <LOCATION>Greensboro</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION> , when Commissioner <PERSON>John Swofford</PERSON> willaccept the <ORGANIZATION>Naismith award.When Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> announced its self-imposed ban , there were skeptics who saw themove as a preemptory move designed to bring the investigation to an end during adown year for the Orange . 
At best , <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> was an <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> bubble team . 
Morelikely , it would have played in the <ORGANIZATION>NIT</ORGANIZATION> , which would have excited coaches , players and fans in <LOCATION>Central New York</LOCATION> almost as much as the prospect of a Marchsnowstorm.The move worked : The penalties are more embarrassing than substantive . 
Syracusewo n't miss any TV time and will be eligible to play in next season 's NCAAtournament . 
And then again , it did n't work : The <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> pompously concluded theschool had to be penalized because it had " failed to monitor its athleticsprogram and its head basketball coach failed to monitor his program . " 
InEnglish , this means there were academic issues , drug-testing issues and an issueinvolving a booster who was passing out money he should n't have been passingout.The real question is whether <PERSON>Boeheim</PERSON> , who turned 70 in <DATE>November</DATE> , wants to dealwith all of this going forward . 
In recent years , he has finally been recognizedas one of the deans of the sport . 
He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2005and has been <PERSON>Mike Krzyzewski</PERSON> 's most trusted assistant with the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> nationalteam for the past 10 years.This certainly is n't the way he wants to go out . 
But the large blemishes of therecent past certainly have to blur his vision of the future.But <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> is n't the only ACC team making news that might not quite live up tothe <ORGANIZATION>Naismith Legacy Award</ORGANIZATION> . 
<LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> is being investigated by the NCAAafter an independent investigator hired by the school concluded there had beenacademic fraud involving athletes - many of them basketball players - from <DATE>1993to 2011</DATE> . 
No one knows what the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> will do with <LOCATION>Carolina</LOCATION> because the case is unique . 
Butthere is a lot of collective breath-holding going on throughout the state.And earlier in the week , the student newspaper at <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> broke a story reportingthat former basketball player <PERSON>Rasheed Sulaimon</PERSON> , who was booted from the team onJan . 
29 , had twice been accused of sexual assault during the 2013-14 academicyear . 
According to the story , Duke athletic officials , including <PERSON>Krzyzewski</PERSON> , knew about the accusations as early as last March.That story is not the grand cover-up the anti-Duke and anti-Krzyzewski factionswould like to see exposed ; no one has filed any charges against Sulaimon , and hewas thrown off the team . 
Regardless , the incident probably wo n't come upSaturday during <PERSON>Swofford</PERSON> 's acceptance speech.If the <ORGANIZATION>ACC</ORGANIZATION> can figure out a way to get a couple more schools into NCAA hotwater , it may be a candidate for the <ORGANIZATION>Nobel Peace Prize</ORGANIZATION> by the end of the year.There 's also a not-so-minor basketball issue . 
With all the chest-beating theconference has done about how the additions of <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Notre Dameand Louisville</LOCATION> have made it the best league this side of the <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> 's WesternConference , here 's a dirty little secret : An ACC team has n't reached the FinalFour since <DATE>2010</DATE> . 
The league was formed in <DATE>1953-54</DATE> . 
From the <DATE>1962</DATE> season through <DATE>2010</DATE> , the longestgap without at least one ACC team in the Final Four was two years . 
From <DATE>1981through 2010</DATE> , it sent 27 teams to the Final Four , winning 11 national titles.Since <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> won back-to-back national titles in <DATE>2009</DATE> and <DATE>2010</DATE> , the old Big East and the <ORGANIZATION>Southeastern Conference</ORGANIZATION> have sent four teams , the BigTen three and one apiece for the <DATE>Big 12</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>Horizon League</ORGANIZATION> , Colonial AthleticAssociation , <LOCATION>Missouri Valley</LOCATION> and fledgling American Athletic Conference.Noticeably absent : the Pacific-12 and the ACC.The ACC now has 15 teams , which should increase the odds of getting a team toIndianapolis next month . 
Of course , it had 15 teams last season , and no onereached the Elite Eight - much less the Final Four . 
For a league that was builton basketball and expanded to its current bloated size to try to rebuildbasketball , four straight seasons without a Final Four team are embarrassing.Virginia should be a No. 1 seed on Selection <DATE>Sunday</DATE> . 
Duke appears no lower thana No. 2 , and <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> should be a No. 3 or 4 seed . 
<LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NorthCarolina</ORGANIZATION> also will be teams with a chance to go deep . 
But there 's no guaranteeany of them will make it to Indianapolis.Then again , there 's still hope : After all , <PERSON>Swofford</PERSON> will have that nice <ORGANIZATION>NaismithLegacy Award</ORGANIZATION> to put up on his office wall to look at while he 's reading throughthe 94-page <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> report on <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION> . 
And who knows ? 
Maybe this will be thespring that <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> returns to the Final Four . . . Oh , wait .
