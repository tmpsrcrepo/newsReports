Time for the <ORGANIZATION>Boy Scouts of America</ORGANIZATION> to earn their most important merit badge yet - righteousness.This iconic institution in a neckerchief has marched all the way to the SupremeCourt to reinforce its right to keep openly gay and lesbian adults fromparticipating in the Scouting tradition.At long last , they are thinking twice about that ban . 
" Currently , the <ORGANIZATION>BSA</ORGANIZATION> is discussing potentially removing the national membershiprestriction regarding sexual orientation " is the statement I got from the <ORGANIZATION>BoyScouts of America National Council</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> afternoon.Welcome to this century , Scouts.What was once a staple of American boyhood - knots , camping , pinewood derby cars - has become , for too many , a symbol of intolerance based on thinking born of atime when you actually did have to know how to start a fire with a couple ofsticks.I hate it and I do n't agree with it , but I believe the Scouts ' leadershipbelieved equating homosexuals with pedophiles would end their child abuseproblems.Last <DATE>fall</DATE> , I spent many long , dark days buried in about 2,000 pages of sex abusereports from the Boys Scouts ' " perversion files , " a trove of documents that theScouts amassed to hunt and snare the child abusers preying on their boys.The files , compiled since the <DATE>1920s</DATE> , were private until a court ruling forcedmany of them into the light last year.The stories , interviews and incidents were stomach-churning . 
Some of the reportswere even written in the boys ' own awkward handwriting.And the pattern I saw emerge was consistent with some of the skewed thinking ofthe time . 
" Homosexual " was the conclusion reached on many investigations of pedophileScout leaders . 
Whether it was evidence of a same-sex liaison , fey behavior orvisit to a known gay bar , that was enough to get someone a perversion file.In some cases , there was an arrest and a conviction for the rape of a child . 
Andstill , the label some of them got on the mimeographed perversion file form wasnot " pedophile " or " criminal " or " rapist . " 
Just " homosexual . 
" At some point , after hundreds and hundreds of incident reports - cases where theabuser was almost always a man molesting a boy - the Boy Scouts ' leaders musthave simply figured that banning gay men would solve their problem.But guess what ? 
The abuse did n't stop . 
Homosexual does not mean pedophile . 
Itdid n't back then , and it does n't now.Hundreds of young boys were supposed to be protected by blind hope and theelimination of anyone who was openly gay from the organization . 
Meanwhile , predators slipped in beneath the Scouting council 's gaydar.According to the court files , the molesters were fathers who abused Scouts aswell as their own children - boys and girls . 
Men who had macho jobs and loved totalk about porn got away with sexual abuse for years . 
And married men , prominentin their communities and professions , fooled them all.Meanwhile , mom <PERSON>Jennifer Tyrrell</PERSON> was kicked out of her spot as a Tiger Den motherin <LOCATION>Bridgeport</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> , last year after the Scouts ' leadership council found outshe is openly lesbian . 
The families of her own pack loved her community-mindedand active leadership of the boys and fought for her reinstatement.But in a Mad Men - or maybe even <ORGANIZATION>Downton Abbey</ORGANIZATION> - move , the Scouts said no wayand quoted their ancient , creaking policy of not allowing " avowed homosexuals " into their ranks.Then a kid in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Ryan Andresen</PERSON> , had his Eagle Scout application deniedlast fall after he came out.And a gay dad in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> was kicked off the popcorn committee.Hearing of all these incidents , and seeing the <ORGANIZATION>Boy Scouts</ORGANIZATION> stick to their banlong after " Queer Eye " hit prime time and same-sex soldiers said " I do , " scaredlots of parents away from Scouting.Parents like me and my husband - both of us had great experiences as Scouts-suddenly felt conflicted about continuing the tradition as the Scouts ' stubborness made them a symbol of hate.The national council , it appears , is listening to the grass-roots groundswell.Capitol Hill 's Troop 500 posted on its Web site its refusal to acknowledge thenational ban , as have many others.When they were organized in <DATE>1910</DATE> , the Boy Scouts of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> were there " to teach [ boys ] patriotism , courage , self-reliance , and kindred virtues . 
" Took them a long time , but it looks like they may be finally coming back tothose founding ideas.One hundred years later , you may have finally earned your courage badge , Scouts.dvorakp@washpost.comTwitter: @petuladTo read previous columns , go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak .
