More than 1,000 American women have died or suffered wounds in combat in <LOCATION>Iraqand Afghanistan</LOCATION> over the past 11 years . 
At long last , the government is givingthem official permission to do so.The decision by <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Leon E. Panetta</PERSON> to lift the ban on womenserving in combat roles is the second historic , game-changing shift within theU.S . 
military in little more than a year . 
It follows on the heels of thedecision to let homosexuals serve their country openly . 
" First the gays , and now the broads , " exulted one friend of mine , a former <ORGANIZATION>Navyofficer</ORGANIZATION> , on her Facebook feed . 
" The military is going to hell in a handbasket , and I could n't be happier . 
" What this means is that about 250,000 combat jobs that women were officiallybanned from are now open . 
And yes , it means that more women will be dying.The fight for an equal right to serve on the front lines has been a supremelyrighteous struggle . 
This was not a campaign for the corner office , the countryclub membership or the keys to the executive washroom . 
This was an argument toserve with equal risk and to acknowledge that if there is a draft , our moms , daughters , sisters and wives will likely be told to go , too . 
And it underscoresthe idea that a man is no more expendable than a woman.To understand why women in the military are cheering this move is to comprehendthe absolute hypocrisy military women have faced for <ORGANIZATION>years.Army Reserve</ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON>Ellen Haring</PERSON> , one of the women who filed a lawsuit last springto open combat jobs to women , was elated and shocked <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> . 
" We were getting ready for a long , drawn-out legal fight ; this caught me totallyby surprise , " said <PERSON>Haring</PERSON> , who lives in <LOCATION>Northern Virginia</LOCATION> but talked to me fromthe <ORGANIZATION>Army War College</ORGANIZATION> outside of <LOCATION>Harrisburg</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION> , where she works.Haring made it clear to me that the ban was n't about protecting sacred XXcreatures , givers of life . 
Her lawsuit amounted to a demand that women be givenbetter odds at surviving combat situations , which they get into quitefrequently.According to a report <DATE>last April</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>Congressional Research Service</ORGANIZATION> , about283 ,000 women have been deployed to <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> . 
More than 800 havebeen injured and 139 have been killed.Haring gave me the example of 1st Lt. <PERSON>Ashley White</PERSON> , a 24-year-old from <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> whowas embedded with an <ORGANIZATION>Army Ranger</ORGANIZATION> unit in <LOCATION>Kandahar</LOCATION> province in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> whenshe and two Rangers were killed by a roadside bomb . 
White was with the unitbecause she could do things - such as frisk women in burqas - that men could n't . 
" Women like her do this all the time , " <PERSON>Haring</PERSON> explained , when we talked abouther lawsuit last spring.And there were women in supply lines , drivers , techs - all killed in combat.What made <PERSON>Haring</PERSON> furious was that the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> was going around the no-combat ruleby attaching women to these units but not giving them the same combat trainingthat men get . 
" I have n't talked about this before , but I have a daughter serving , she 's alieutenant in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> , " <PERSON>Haring</PERSON> said . 
" So I did this for my daughter , for mygranddaughter , or all the other young women who will now have opportunities Idid n't have . 
" Haring is a West Point graduate who longed to go through <ORGANIZATION>Army Ranger</ORGANIZATION> trainingbut never had the option.The change in women 's roles is particularly felt in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , wherehigh-ranking women in and around the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> often hit the so-called " brassceiling " because they never had the chance to earn the combat creds that theirmale counterparts had . 
" But it also reverberates throughout our culture , because if you do n't treatwomen equally , we wo n't be valued equally . 
" With the change , the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Department</ORGANIZATION> eliminated " the last place thegovernment was able to formally discriminate against women , " <PERSON>Haring</PERSON> said.She had been helping plan a symposium for next week on pushing for women incombat roles , but instead , the focus will be on implementation . 
The symposiumwill hear from other women who serve on the front lines from around the world , like a Norwegian infantry officer who was among the very first women to take ajob in combat.And anyone who dares still to suggest - or even think - that women are n't toughenough for the job is completely delusional.I was scared to death when I was late for an interview with now retired <ORGANIZATION>ArmyBrig</ORGANIZATION> . 
Gen. <PERSON>Rhonda Cornum</PERSON> , a surgeon , pilot , wife and mother.Cornum was sexually abused when she was taken prisoner during the Persian GulfWar . 
She was shot and captured after her helicopter was gunned down.Her book , " She Went to War : The <PERSON>Rhonda Cornum Story</PERSON> , " recounts how she survivedall that and describes how the men she was with all piled on top of her to saveher from gunfire , pinning her to the helicopter floor and thus ensuring she ' dget shot.Any American soldier would be lucky to have her close by in combat . 
( And she waspretty nice about me being late , too . ) 
But beyond the practical aspect of <PERSON>Panetta</PERSON> 's decision , acknowledging that whichhas already happened ( See : " do n't ask , do n't tell " ) , there is the symbolic , final cracking of one of the world 's largest glass ceilings and one of the lastmale bastions . 
Well , sanctioned ones , at least.It turns out , the greatest enemy that women face in the military is from within.The nation 's three military academies reported in <DATE>December</DATE> record numbers ofsexual assaults . 
<ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> officials this week likened the sexual assaultswithin their ranks to a " cancer . 
" And if anyone dare say that this increase is simply because there are now morewomen serving alongside the men , then we have much bigger problems than we everimagined.But then again , maybe that will also change once women get that combat training.dvorakp@washpost.comTwitter: @petuladTo read earlier columns , go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak.Follow me on Twitter at @petulad .
