The instant message blinked on the computer at <PERSON>Jessica Cutler</PERSON> 's desk in <ORGANIZATION>theRussell Senate Office Building</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Oh my God , you 're famous . 
" Before she could form the thought -- " famous , cool " -- or puzzle how she , alowly mail clerk , had escaped obscurity , a second instant message popped up onher screen . 
Startled , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> recalls , she began to curse . 
" Your blog is on Wonkette , " the message said.Jessica 's blog ( short for " Web log " ) was the online diary she had been postinganonymously to amuse herself and her closest girlfriends . 
In it , she detailedthe peccadilloes of the men she said were her six current sexual partners , including a married <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration official who met her in hotel rooms andgave her envelopes of cash ; a senator 's staff member who helped hire her , thenlater bedded her ; and another man who liked to spank and be spanked.Wonkette is a popular online gossip column that was read by lots of <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> ' sfriends and Capitol Hill co-workers , including some of the men in her blog.The messages warning <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> that her private little joke had just gone verypublic came from a girlfriend over on the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> side . 
Reading it , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says , she was too stunned to wonder how Wonkette had discovered her blog . 
Instead , theportion of <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> 's brain that had evolved to help humans survive maraudingmastodons screamed : Kill the blog ! 
Kill the blog!Typing and clicking her mouse at a desperate pace , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> logged on toblogger.com , the electronic bulletin board where she 'd posted her sexploitsunder the pseudonym Washingtonienne , and deleted her blog , hoping she 'd blownher diary into oblivion . 
She says she barely breathed as she closed outblogger.com and summoned <LOCATION>Wonkette.com</LOCATION> onto her screen . 
There it was : a teasingitem noting that an unnamed staffer for a certain Midwestern senator was surelygoing to get a book contract out of her X-rated blog . 
The gossip columnistoffered her readers a link so they could read the sex diary for themselves.Jessica clicked on the link . 
" Page not found , " came the reply.A reprieve . 
Maybe nobody on Capitol Hill had read or copied her blog beforeshe 'd deleted it . 
Maybe nobody would figure out that <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> was the staffer whowrote it . 
Maybe this was no biggie.Or maybe she needed to start looking for a new job right now.Jessica tried opening and sorting mail . 
That 's what she was paid to do as astaff assistant for Sen. <PERSON>Mike DeWine</PERSON> , a Republican from <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> . 
She liked to jokethat her job was really to throw out the mail , the stacks of letters fromearnest voters who believe members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> actually care what they think.Too jittery to work , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> dumped her stack of unopened mail on the two newinterns in her office . 
She figured they 'd still be filled with youthfulenthusiasm for serving their government , seeing as how it was only their secondday on the job.Just then , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says , the office door swung open . 
Framed in the doorway wasthe man she 'd chronicled on the blog as her latest and favorite paramour -- aserious committee staffer more likely to be featured in some wonk newsletterthan an online sex diary . 
He did n't look happy.He asked her to step into the hallway , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says . 
He was clutching a printoutof her blog . 
" I have nothing to say to you about this , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> recalls himsaying before he walked away . 
" Okay , bye , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> said . 
She slunk back to her desk thinking , " Boy , am Igetting off easy . 
" A few minutes later , she noticed one of the senator 's senior aides standing afew feet away , glaring . 
This was the woman <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says set her up on her firstdate with the committee staffer . 
In her blog , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> breezily referred to heras a pimp . 
Now , the senior aide <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> had called a pimp looked as if shewanted to rip <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> 's head off . 
" You are the sorriest excuse for a human being , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> remembers the womanshouting . 
" You are worthless . 
" The woman and the committee staffer both declined to be interviewed for thisarticle through <PERSON>Mike Dawson</PERSON> , <PERSON>DeWine</PERSON> 's director of communications . 
Dawsondeclined to publicly discuss the accuracy of <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> 's blog or her account ofwhat happened after it became public.But , according to <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> , the woman continued berating her until <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> askedmeekly , " What should I do ? 
" The woman told <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> she should pack up and leave before she had her thrownout . 
" You better hope I never see you outside this building , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> recallsher saying.This was turning out to be a really lousy 26th birthday.Jessica tottered down the Russell Building 's marble hallways atop the cute,nude-colored sandals that she liked to think made her legs look longer andsexier . 
She tugged forlornly at the cardigan she wore to cover her straplesspink birthday-girl-going-out-tonight dress . 
She felt ill , she says . 
By the timeshe reached her girlfriend 's office on the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> side , her stomach was heavingand her throat was so constricted she could barely speak . 
" I 'm fired , " she mouthed silently at her friend . 
" Oh my God , you need a drink . 
" A few minutes later , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> and her friend slid onto stools in the cool dimnessof Bullfeathers , a popular Capitol Hill watering hole . 
Jessica ordered aSouthern Comfort . 
It was the middle of the <TIME>afternoon</TIME> on <DATE>May 18</DATE> . 
" What happened to you today ? " 
the bartender asked . 
" I got fired . 
I lost my boyfriend and my job , and it 's my birthday , " Jessicaremembers telling him . 
" How did you get fired ? " 
the bartender wanted to know . 
" I wrote an X-rated blog , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> said.The bartender looked puzzled . 
" What 's a blog ? " 
he asked.Soon , the answer to that question would be writ large , not only acrossWashington , but around the world . 
The Times of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> dubbed her the " New-insky . 
" <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> 's unapologetically snarky chronicle of her busy sex life , her audaciousrefusal to keep the pawing patriarchy 's dirty secrets , her contempt for honestbut unglamorous public service , her cynical wit and sexy looks would combinewith the power of the Web to launch her into low-orbit celebrity.She posed for Playboy in a pictorial that will run this <DATE>fall</DATE> , just in time forthe election . 
Book agents pursued her , and a literary bidding war netted her asix-figure book deal . 
" It 's more than I probably deserve , " she says . 
" Ha ! 
I ' msure a lot of people will agree . 
" The tittering hordes vilified <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> even as they pursued her , denouncing heronline , around office coolers and in commentaries from the left and right.Jessica thinks she knows why . 
In a culture increasingly nervous about its ownvalues , numbly sinking into the sofa at night to watch trash reality TV showsand wondering if our own 14-year-old sons and daughters are casually " hookingup , " it 's satisfying to have a bona fide blog slut to flog . 
" I was watching the movie ' Scarface ' the other night , and I was like , Oh my God , this is exactly how I feel , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says . 
" There is that scene where [ thegangster played by <PERSON>Al Pacino</PERSON> ] was in a restaurant . 
He was all coked up . 
He getsthrown out . 
He tells everyone in the restaurant , ' You need me . 
You need me . 
Youneed me so you can point at me and say that 's the bad guy . ' 
" <PERSON>JESSICA CUTLER</PERSON> , THE MOUSE-CLICKER THAT ROARED , is a smart , subversive waif witha certain <LOCATION>South Park</LOCATION> charm . 
She 's 5 feet 2 , weighs about 100 pounds , wears hoopearrings as big as her fist and has a higher IQ -- she says she 's been twicetested at more than 140 -- than the average medical student.Jessica was officially fired for misusing an office computer , but the men shewrote about kept their jobs . 
What they lost was their privacy . 
Jessica 's blogidentified them only by their initials . 
But amateur Internet sleuths who readthe blog searched electronic databases looking for likely suspects , then postednames and photographs on the Internet . 
Jessica still refuses to name the menpublicly . 
" I feel really bad for the guys , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says . 
" They did n't deserve this . 
" As for herself , she tries to look on the bright side . 
" I was only blogging for , what , less than two weeks ? " 
she says . 
" Some people with blogs are never going toget famous , and they 've been doing it for , like , over a year . 
I feel bad forthem . 
" Sitting in a corner table at the <LOCATION>Palm</LOCATION> one recent afternoon , she twists a strandof her long dark hair as she contemplates her place in the universe . 
" I was the one writing on the bathroom wall " with her online diary . 
" A lot ofmen have bad things to say about me , " acknowledges <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> , who has beenGoogling herself to read anonymous diatribes from online critics . 
" I reallyupset them . 
I think it bothers them to find out that girls really do , you know , get together and laugh about guys ' [ anatomies ] all day . 
" She 's a next-generation Monica , still snapping her thong and gabbing to thegirls , only more cynical : free of romantic illusions about powerful men who aregoing to leave their wives . 
She 's a real-life , " Sex and the City " - style <PERSON>Samanthawho</PERSON> says sex is pure sport . 
She is an American uber-individualist demanding theright to tell her own story her own way . 
" Everyone should have a blog , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says . 
" It 's the most democratic thingever . 
" And she 's something else . 
" She 's a sign , " says <PERSON>Daniel Yankelovich</PERSON> , the pollster and analyst who has beenstudying American values for 50 years . 
He means a sign of our times , as isJessica 's frumpy 21-year-old contemporary , Pfc. <PERSON>Lynndie England</PERSON> , whose gleefulmugging for the cameras as she mocked naked Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraibunsettled the national conscience . 
Both women have left many people questioning : How did we get here?Jessica 's " behavior is not mainstream majority behavior in the same way thatmost soldiers in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> are not abusing people , " <PERSON>Yankelovich</PERSON> says . 
" She 's anextreme , but she 's a sign . 
These kinds of signs are breaking out often enoughthat you know they are signaling something much larger and more important . 
" Feminist author <PERSON>Naomi Wolf</PERSON> agrees , and says modern sexual conduct offers awindow into what 's been gained and lost in the nation 's values revolution . 
Thesexual revolution , now stripped of much of its feminist political ideology , hasleft legions of young women free but confused . 
" I think the tipping point camethree or four years ago with the first generation to grow up with the Internet , " Wolf says . 
" They were daughters of feminists . 
The feminist message of autonomygot filtered through a pornographized culture . 
The message they heard was justgo for it sexually . 
" What is gained is they totally reject the double standard and believe they areentitled to sexual exploration and sexual satisfaction , " <PERSON>Wolf</PERSON> says . 
" Thedownside is we 've raised a generation of young women -- and men -- who do n'tunderstand sexual ethics like : Do n't sleep with a married man ; do n't sleep witha married woman ; do n't embarrass people with whom you had a consensual sexualrelationship . 
They do n't see sex as sacred or even very important anymore.That 's been lost . 
Sex has been commodified and drained of its deeper meaning . 
" To conservative commentator <PERSON>Michelle Malkin</PERSON> , who views the sexual revolution asmedia-driven , immoral and damaging to women , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> 's eager publicists in themainstream press are just as repulsive as <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> herself . 
" This vulgar littleepisode reflects a larger , disturbing media trend toward normalizing andglamorizing sexual promiscuity among young working women , " <PERSON>Malkin</PERSON> wrote in anonline column titled " The Skanks on Capitol Hill , " which was posted on thetownhall.com Web site . 
" It harms those trying to succeed on their merits in theprofessional arena . 
And it also harms our own daughters , who will be forced tofight harder to protect their dignity and credibility in a ' Girls Gone Wild ' culture . 
" That culture has been well documented . 
In <DATE>1971</DATE> , <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of American girlsages 15 to 19 had had sexual intercourse , according to the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for DiseaseControl</ORGANIZATION> and Prevention . 
By <DATE>1988</DATE> , that number had climbed to <PERCENT>51 percent</PERCENT> . 
Thesteady rise leveled off in the late <DATE>1980s</DATE> , then dipped slightly , in part becauseof AIDS awareness campaigns . 
Still , a substantial number of today 's teenagegirls report that they and their friends engage in casual sex with multiplepartners devoid of emotional <PERCENT>commitments.Twenty-eight percent</PERCENT> of girls ages 15 to 17 said that sexual intercourse was " almost always " or " most of the time " part of a casual relationship , accordingto a <DATE>2002</DATE> survey by the <ORGANIZATION>Kaiser Family Foundation</ORGANIZATION> and Seventeen magazine . 
Thirtypercent of girls surveyed said relationships between boyfriends and girlfriendstypically involved someone cheating or doing something sexual with someone <PERSON>else.Pepper Schwartz</PERSON> , a <ORGANIZATION>University of Washington</ORGANIZATION> professor who has been teaching andwriting about human sexuality for more than 20 years , says she 's not surprisedto see more young women engage in casual sex without emotional ties . 
" In everyway women are becoming more like men , " she says . 
" They are ambitious . 
They areaggressive . 
They are independent . 
And more and more , they participate in bloodsports , aggressive sports . 
" Yet even <PERSON>Schwartz</PERSON> , who hosts occasional online sexual advice chats , has beenamazed at how sexually bold some young women have become . 
" High school girlswill be open about bisexual contact , and high school boys think bisexual girlsare the sexiest thing on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> . 
One of the No. 1 questions I am asked is aboutthree-ways . 
' My boyfriend asks about three-ways . 
Should I or should n't I ? ' 
" I guess it should n't surprise us , " <PERSON>Schwartz</PERSON> concludes . 
" Look how much sex is onevery daytime soap opera , every sitcom . 
We are permeated with this stuff . 
Did wereally think it would just stay inside that 21-inch tube ? 
" Sexual mores are only the crest of a tidal wave of change . 
In a span of about 15years during the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and <DATE>1970s</DATE> , Americans underwent the kind of dramatictransformation of social values that usually occurs over generations , <ORGANIZATION>Yankelovich</ORGANIZATION> says . 
First college students , and then an overwhelming majority ofAmericans , rejected much of the social rigidity of the <DATE>1950s</DATE> . 
Deeply heldAmerican values such as conformity , respectability , sacrifice and duty to otherswere elbowed aside by newer values : personal satisfaction , individual choice anda pluralism that tolerates vast differences in race , religion and lifestyle.Yankelovich has coined the term " expressive individualism " to describe the newethic of personal freedom that , among other things , opened the way for women , gays and minorities to make extraordinary gains . 
" It was a sweeping revolution , and we are still figuring out its consequences , " <ORGANIZATION>Yankelovich</ORGANIZATION> says.One unintended consequence of the revolution , he says , is that social moralityhas now become so relative it has begun to make Americans on both the left andright very anxious , although they disagree sharply on what to do about that.Yankelovich sees that nervousness in Americans ' responses to events as diverseas <ORGANIZATION>Enron</ORGANIZATION> 's accounting fictions , the <ORGANIZATION>Roman Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> 's protection ofpedophiles , the Iraqi prison abuse scandal and <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> 's blog . 
" The country is taken aback by moral relativism in all of its forms , " Yankelovich says . 
" To me , the best way of thinking about it is that people arenow free to say : ' I did n't do anything wrong . 
I did n't break the law . ' 
Anearlier generation , my own generation growing up in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , wouldsay , ' What has the law got to do with it ? ' 
The usual model for societies is thatthey have a very thin layer of law and a very thick layer of social morality.What this expressive individualism has done , as an unintended consequence , isweaken that layer of social morality to the point where it 's almostdisappeared . 
" In other words , we can denounce <PERSON>Jessica Cutler</PERSON> and call her a blog slut if itmakes us feel any better . 
But she is , for better or worse , our blog slut.THE DAY JESSICA 'S BLOG WENT PUBLIC , work halted at many desks across Washingtonas Hill staffers , government bureaucrats , lobbyists and journalists forwardedlinks to friends . 
<PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> was quickly pegged as the unnamed staffer . 
From there , people speculated about the identity of her more powerful playmates and arguedabout what she represented . 
Was <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> a new-media revolutionary who turned thetables on the kind of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> men who have always expected their pretty youngplaythings to be powerless and silent ? 
Or was she a sleazy hedonist who mademoney from her sexual liaisons ? 
The debate has n't ended , especially among women.On a recent weeknight , a group of young professional women sip wine after workat the 18th Street Lounge in the District and discuss the ways <PERSON>Jessica Cutlerseems</PERSON> both familiar to them and yet extreme . 
" She depresses me . 
I do n't think people can do those kind of things withoutemotional repercussions , " says a 27-year-old who works in advertising . 
Thiswoman has never had a one-night stand and ca n't imagine engaging in casual sexwith six different men , she says . 
But <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> 's frank talk about sex did n'tstrike her as unusual . 
" Women love to talk about sex , " she says . 
" That 's what we do when we gettogether and drink . 
If I was in a relationship with someone I cared about and Iwas concerned about my performance , I 'd talk about it in graphic detail with myfriends . 
I 've learned most of my sex tips from girlfriends . 
" Across the street at the Lucky Bar , a group of graduate students ponder whatJessica was seeking when she kissed and blogged , and whether she ever found it . 
" The only way she thought she could have any influence was through sex , " says a24-year-old public policy student in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for a <DATE>summer</DATE> internship . 
" Ido n't think anyone should use sex for power . 
If you want to have unattached , unemotional sex , that 's fine . 
But using it for power is wrong . 
" What is an acceptable motive for having unattached , unemotional sex ? 
" Pleasure , " she says . 
" I HAVE A ' GLAMOUR JOB ' ON THE HILL . 
That is , I could not care less about gov orpolitics , but working for a Senator looks good on my resume . 
And these marblehallways are such great places for meeting boys and showing off my outfits . 
" This is <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> 's very first blog entry , posted at <TIME>5:32 p.m.</TIME> on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> , May5 . 
But that 's not where the story of <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> 's blog began.Jessica grew up in <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> , the oldest of three daughters raised by aformer <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> soldier and his Korean-born wife . 
Her parents fought a lot , remembers <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> , who was in junior high when they divorced . 
Her mother movedout , leaving the girls to live with their father . 
They started leading largelyseparate lives . 
" We all got cable in our rooms , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says . 
" We all would just go to ourrooms at the end of the day and watch the shows we wanted to watch . 
" From first grade through junior high , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> spent one day each week in aspecial program for gifted and talented children . 
Jessica and some of herschoolmates describe the program as pure free-to-be-you-and-me fun : Nobodygraded them ; nobody gave them homework ; nobody cared if they finished anything.Those classes left a mark on <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> . 
" They tell you , ' You guys , you are smarterthan most people , ' " recalls <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> , whose closest friends remain the girls shemet in that program at age 7 . 
Jessica finds it curious that she and several of her gifted classmates becameunderemployed slackers with attitudes . 
She wonders if that traces back to thelessons they learned in the gifted program . 
" You kind of create your own moraluniverse , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says . 
" It 's like , well , I like myself . 
If other people do n'tlike me , then whatever . 
I 'm out of here . 
" During <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> 's teen years , her mother was n't at home to offer admonitionsabout sex or romance , but lessons were easy to come by . 
<PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> , a comparativelate-bloomer , remembers some high school classmates casually listing the guysthey 'd slept with and coming up with 20 or 30 partners . 
" Sex was n't taboo from the beginning for our generation , " says <PERSON>Alexandra DeLuca</PERSON> ,25 , one of <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> 's closest childhood friends . 
" We had sex education classesfrom an early age . 
The assumption was you were going to have sex soon , if youwere n't already . 
My parents never gave me the idea that sex was bad . 
My mom wassurprised that I was n't having sex in high school . 
It never was this secretivething you are supposed to be ashamed about . " 
The breakout movie of <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> ' sjunior high school years was " Pretty Woman , " a <DATE>1990</DATE> remake of the Cinderellastory starring <PERSON>Julia Roberts</PERSON> as a prostitute who falls in love with her wealthyjohn , played by <PERSON>Richard Gere</PERSON> . 
He takes her power shopping , and they live happilyever after . 
" Actually , I hated that movie when I saw it as a young teenager , " says <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> , who was 12 when the movie was released . 
" I was , like , that movie is incrediblysexist . 
" Yet as a teenage student at <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse University</ORGANIZATION> , she dated a 38-year-old doctorwho liked to take her shopping for clothes . 
The gifts he bought her , she says , made an impression . 
" That 's the standard you hold every guy to for the rest ofyour life . 
" At <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> worked on the school newspaper , fell in love , lost hervirginity , bounced between her father 's home and friends ' apartments , partiedand received lousy grades . 
She left after four years without earning a degree , although she listed the credential on her résumé . 
She insists she was n't tryingto mislead anyone . 
She says she did n't realize that she had n't been awarded adiploma until it was reported in the post-blog media frenzy . 
She says she musthave had some unreturned library books or unpaid parking tickets that promptedthe university to withhold her degree , although she has n't bothered to check.Her fondest memory of college was a <DATE>summer</DATE> internship in <LOCATION>New York City withNickelodeon</LOCATION> , where she wrote funny stories for the cable network 's magazine forchildren . 
It was a moment when life promised to be as fun and creative as herdays in the gifted and talented program.The moment was fleeting . 
After college , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says , she squatted with friendsin an apartment under construction in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> . 
She did n't have a career plan , always figuring she 'd worry about the future later . 
As she worked a series oflow-level jobs , she came to believe that no matter how smart a woman was , it washer looks that mattered . 
" I used to read , like , Ms. <PERSON>Magazine</PERSON> and all that stuff when I was in highschool , " she says . 
" I was really , like , earnest back then . 
When I grew up andsaw the way people are , I had to adapt . 
It 's more about your looks than anythingyou can do . 
If you are not attractive , if you are fat , you do n't get seated [ ata restaurant ] , like , in the window or outside . 
If you want to do what you wantto do , you have to look a certain way . 
" <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> did . 
She burned through men and jobs in rapid succession and for muchthe same reason : She could not stand to be bored . 
And she bored easily . 
The wayJessica saw it , suckers were stuck doing things they did n't want to do . 
Jessicarefused.Jessica and some of her friends adopted an attitude about sex that they knewwas , in earlier generations , the purview of male cads . 
" I think men want tothink that for women sex equals love , but it 's not like that at all , " saysDeLuca , now a freelance writer in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> . 
" Women can have a one-night standfor fun . 
It does n't mean we are going to marry the man or even like him . 
We justthought he was hot . 
" My girlfriends and I have talked about how if you have a one-night stand and hetries to cuddle with you , you are like , ' What are you doing ? 
It 's a one-nightstand ! ' 
It 's not like he 's your boyfriend or anything . 
Women our age do talkabout sex like men , and we do treat sex like men . 
It 's not a terrible thing.That 's what people our age do . 
" A life of sexual freedom and ironic detachment , however , is not always as muchfun as it 's portrayed in sitcoms , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> acknowledges . 
" It probably is just ahuge defense mechanism , dating several men , " she says . 
" Because you are , like , if it does n't go well with this guy , there 's always the others , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says . 
" I think ultimately , with that kind of defense mechanism , all your relationshipsare kind of half-assed . 
You know ? 
" Yet <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> always managed to make it all sound hilarious . 
Job disasters andill-fated couplings were fodder for entertaining her girlfriends . 
Sure , it wasweird when every older guy with a big job who offered to give her a " tour " ofhis office turned out to want to do it on his sofa . 
Sure , it was twisted whenthe psychiatrist she dated insisted on calling her Mommy . 
But if she could laughabout it , how bad could it be ? 
If she could make others laugh about it , tell andretell the stories of her life as if she were polishing a " Seinfeld " script , then she was the one in control . 
Was n't she?Jessica moved to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> last year . 
She thought it would be less expensivethan <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> , but more exciting than some hicksville . 
She shared an apartmentwith the boyfriend who had , in recent years , become the closest thing she had toa steady . 
Sometimes they talked about getting married . 
Most nights , they watchedtelevision together . 
On weekends , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> shopped for cute clothes . 
She wasconfused , she says now . 
If they loved each other , why was she so bored?She began cheating with older , more powerful men she met around <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , andshe was n't even sure why . 
Maybe , she says , it was for the sheer thrill . 
Jessicadid n't hide from any of them that she drank heavily and used drugs such asecstasy , she says . 
She 's tried virtually every party drug , she says , and wasamazed by how many men in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> had n't . 
" They will tell you , ' I have neverdone drugs ' " she marvels . 
" Are you kidding me ? 
. . . I would hope they arelying . 
How could you not even try it ? 
. . . I think that 's just part of beingopen-minded . 
" She took a job answering phones at a nonprofit organization , which was aproblem . 
She hates answering phones . 
" I was kind of , like , resentful about it , " she says . 
Inevitably , she was fired for poor phone manners . 
" Somebody had , like , the wrong number , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> recalls . 
" They kept calling backto yell at me . 
And I got into , like , a thing with them . 
I told them , ' This isthe wrong number ! ' 
I hung up on them . 
They called back and said , ' Do n't hang upon me , ca n't you forward me ? ' 
I was like , ' No , get a phone book . ' 
" I was spoken to about it . 
Then a VIP -- I mean a VIP for , like , <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , because I do n't even know who she is -- called . 
I think she wanted me to say , ' <DATE>May</DATE> I ask who is calling ? ' 
I was like , ' Who is this ? 
I need to know . ' 
Shecomplained about me . 
" Late last year , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> responded to a notice for an unpaid internship in theoffice of <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> Democratic Sen. <PERSON>Joe Lieberman</PERSON> because people kept tellingher that to get anywhere in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> she needed Hill experience . 
She contactedthe <PERSON>Lieberman</PERSON> staffer listed as a contact on the job posting , a man she wouldlater write about in her blog . 
She got the internship and began in <DATE>January</DATE> . 
Herduties included occasionally answering the phone , she says.To earn money , she worked as a hostess at I <PERSON>Ricchi</PERSON> , a pricey Italian restaurantacross 19th Street NW from the <LOCATION>Palm</LOCATION> . 
That did n't last . 
It was raining hard thenight that " K Street , " the pseudo-reality television show featuring realWashington power brokers in scripted scenarios , held a premiere party at thePalm . 
The whole block was mobbed . 
Jessica 's customers were mad they had to waitfor tables . 
She kept losing their wet umbrellas and disappearing to look forthem . 
When a manager chided her for ignoring her duties at the front door , shesnapped , " I really do n't give a [ expletive ] . ' 
And so ended another job . 
Asalways , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> telephoned and e-mailed her friends with madcap accounts of herlatest job fiasco . 
" <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> has been fired from more jobs than anyone I know , " <PERSON>DeLuca</PERSON> says . 
" Shelists the jobs on her résumé that she 's been fired from . 
Nobody checks that out.The reality , which <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> knows , is that she 's a very pretty girl . 
She can becharming when she wants to be . 
She gets hired as easily as she gets fired . 
" And that is why DeLuca figures that all the people who employed <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> on theHill deserved exactly what happened next . 
" If Capitol Hill is this shiningexample of anything , how did she get hired ? " 
DeLuca asks . 
" That 's why it 's sosilly , people getting mad at her for bringing shame on the senator 's office orthe Hill or the system . 
Look at the guy who hired her for an internship , thenasked her out . 
Look at the woman who supervised her , then pimped her out.Something is wrong with the system . 
It 's not her . 
" <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> left her unpaid internship in <PERSON>Lieberman</PERSON> 's office in late <DATE>February</DATE> for apaid , entry-level post in DeWine 's office . 
The résumé she used to land the jobstated incorrectly that she had earned a <ORGANIZATION>BA</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION> and listed the wrongbirth date , shaving two years off her age.Right after leaving <PERSON>Lieberman</PERSON> 's office , she ran into the staffer she believedhad hired her for her internship . 
<PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> , who by then was working for <ORGANIZATION>DeWine</ORGANIZATION> , says the man asked her out for drinks a few times , and they had sex.The <PERSON>Lieberman</PERSON> staffer in question declined to be interviewed for this story.After <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> 's blog surfaced , <PERSON>Lieberman</PERSON> asked his chief of staff to review thematter , according to <PERSON>Matt Gobush</PERSON> , the senator 's director of communications.Gobush acknowledges that the <PERSON>Lieberman</PERSON> staffer was listed as the contact on theinternship posting <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> responded to and that he had sat in on her interview.But ultimately that staffer did not make the decision to hire her , <PERSON>Gobush says.Although Gobush</PERSON> says the matter is still under review , any alleged sexualcontact between a staffer and a former intern would not violate the officepolicy prohibiting sexual harassment.But <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> had definitely violated the policies of her live-in boyfriend . 
Afterhe discovered that she 'd cheated on him , she moved out and got her ownapartment . 
By the <DATE>first week of May</DATE> , she was having flings with so many guysthat reporting them all to her girlfriends was starting to feel like way toomuch work . 
" So I sent a mass e-mail out : ' You guys , should I have my own blog or what ? ' 
Iwas kidding , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says . 
" But they were all , like , ' Yes , if anyone shouldhave a blog it 's you , because you have the most interesting life . ' 
" The electronic bulletin board where <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> began posting her online diaryoffered her the option of creating a password so no one could read it withouther consent . 
" But I thought that was , like , too much trouble for my friends to have to typein a password , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says . 
" I thought there are so many people with their ownblogs , mine is not even going to come up on the radar . 
" UNTIL RECENTLY , MANY AMERICANS HAD NEVER HEARD THE TERM BLOG . 
Web logs were thealmost exclusive purview of techies . 
Now an estimated 3 million Americansmaintain blogs , which range from tame online diaries to comic fantasies , fromworkplace chronicles to political screeds . 
Many are posted anonymously , andthere is no way to judge their veracity.Bloggers circumvent traditional information gatekeepers , such as newspapers , magazines and book publishers , by telling their story their way . 
In <LOCATION>Louisiana</LOCATION> , for example , a former state trooper battling leukemia is blogging hisexperiences in an experimental drug trial -- months before the doctors publishtheir results.The gatekeepers are scrambling to respond . 
Advertisers now pay for space onpopular blogs . 
Book agents and publishers routinely scan blogs looking for newtalent like the blogger-turned-author who posted a fictional account of life asParis <ORGANIZATION>Hilton</ORGANIZATION> 's pet <LOCATION>Chihuahua</LOCATION> . 
Bloggers have been credentialed to cover thissummer 's political conventions.Yet there can be serious consequences for tell-all blogging . 
<PERSON>Heather Armstrong</PERSON> ,29 , learned that the hard way . 
" I tell people , whoever you think is not going to read your Web site will findyour Web site , " <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> says . 
" They specifically will find it and read it , andall hell will break loose . 
" She started her blog three years ago . 
She was living in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> , working asa Web-site designer and trying to reinvent herself . 
" I talked about having sex . 
I talked about drinking . 
I talked about havinglesbian fantasies , " says <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> , who grew up in a strict Mormon family wherecaffeine was verboten and premarital sex unthinkable.Armstrong did n't worry about her family reading her blog . 
Nobody in her familyeven had Internet access . 
But then her brother got a home computer . 
" He wasappalled , " <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> says . 
" My mother called me at work . 
She was bawling for anhour . 
She could n't understand what she had done wrong . 
My father told me I was avile human being and I had succumbed to the dark side . 
He did n't talk to me formonths . 
" I should have learned my lesson then . " 
But she did n't . 
Four months later , <ORGANIZATION>Armstrong</ORGANIZATION> was sitting at her desk at work when she called up an e-mail . 
Someonehad sent every vice president in her company an e-mail directing them to herblog . 
A few days later , she was fired.Armstrong believes that her blog did help her decide who she wanted to be . 
Andshe 's never stopped chronicling her life . 
But she 's much more careful what sheposts now that she is married and has a new baby . 
She knows that once she ' sposted something it will always exist somewhere in the blogosphere.Nevertheless , she still has to remind herself to be her own censor . 
" The scary thing is that here I am on my computer , " she says . 
" I do n't seeanyone reading it . 
I do n't see their faces . 
" A FREELANCE WRITER JESSICA HAD MET ON A VISIT to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> was proving anannoying house guest . 
Having sex with him was one thing , but staying under thesame roof with him was unbearable . 
When he finally headed home <DATE>May 5</DATE> , Jessicaheralded his departure in her brand-new blog . 
" Just got off the phone with [ the writer ] , " she typed . 
" Making sure he is out ofmy apartment and on his way back to <ORGANIZATION>NY</ORGANIZATION> . 
I have a date with [ my former live-inboyfriend ] tonight and do not need [ the writer ] to blow up my spot . 
" <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says her blog had an initial target audience of three : <PERSON>DeLuca</PERSON> near <LOCATION>SanDiego</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Rachel Robertson</PERSON> in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> and a friend on the Hill . 
Jessica had afew ground rules for her blog . 
Everything she posted was true , she told herfriends , and nobody would be identified by their full names , just initials . 
" So , like , 15 minutes after I wrote yesterday 's last post , " she wrote on DayTwo , " [ The <PERSON>Lieberman</PERSON> staffer ] calls me and asks me out for a drink , knowing thatI have plans at <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> I met him in <LOCATION>Hart</LOCATION> and . . . he followed me home around7 :30 . 
" <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> lamented that she did n't have time for a " quickie . " 
She had to throw theLieberman staffer out before her former live-in boyfriend arrived at 8 p.m.Despite the former live-in 's anger at <LOCATION>Jessica</LOCATION> 's infidelity , the two were stillseeing each other -- having sex , watching TV and fighting . 
There was no wayJessica wanted him to catch her again with another man . 
" In summary , Wednesdaywas a revolving door of men , with me pushing one out after another , " she wrote.Late in the morning on that same day , <DATE>May 6</DATE> , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> posted an entry noting herfavorite things about <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . 
" Love how hard-up the men are . 
Love these easygov jobs . " 
To <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> , being on the Hill was a lot like high school : hordes ofhormonally charged people trapped together all day , flirting in the halls andcafeteria . 
" Item ! " 
Jessica posted at <TIME>5:54 p.m.</TIME> on <DATE>May 6</DATE> . 
" A new contender for my fair hand.He works in one of the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> offices . . . [ He ] had my boss ask me out forhim ! 
She actually came in here and said , ' He thinks you 're hot . ' 
How juniorhigh ! 
So all three of us are getting a drink at <ORGANIZATION>Union Station</ORGANIZATION> after work.Looking forward to an evening full of awkward moments . 
" <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says she found it odd that one senior colleague in her office wouldarrange a night out for her with another senior colleague . 
Jessica called herfriend <PERSON>Rachel Robertson</PERSON> to consult . 
" My first reaction was , ' You should sue forsexual harassment , ' " <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> says . 
" Obviously this is n't supposed to happen.It 's using your authority to further someone 's sexual life . 
It 's harder to sayno when your boss is trying to fix you up with someone . 
I thought it was prettymessed up at the time , and <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> did , too . 
" Since the watershed sexual harassment scandals of the <DATE>1990s</DATE> -- a decade in whichAnita Hill faced down <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON>Clarence Thomas</PERSON> during hisconfirmation hearings , a series of women accused former senators <PERSON>Brock Adams</PERSON> andBob Packwood of predatory sexual advances , and President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> facedimpeachment for having sexual contact with a <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> intern and then lyingabout it -- almost every <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> workplace , including <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> offices , has awritten policy prohibiting or discouraging sexual contact between colleagues , especially those of unequal power.While <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> referred to the woman as her " boss , " <PERSON>DeWine</PERSON> 's communicationsdirector , <PERSON>Mike Dawson</PERSON> , says that 's not true . 
Neither the woman nor the committeestaffer directly supervised <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> or had the power to promote or fire her , <PERSON>Dawson</PERSON> says . 
Thus , their alleged behavior would n't be prohibited by the office ' ssexual harassment policy , he says.Jessica 's blog postings at <TIME>9:35 the next morning</TIME> made it clear she was n'tthinking about suing anyone . " 
[ He ] looks just like <PERSON>George Clooney</PERSON> when he takesoff his glasses , " she wrote . 
" I am serious . . . I put the moves on HIM . . . SoI 'm seeing ANOTHER person on the Hill . 
At least this one is counsel , and not anaide . " 
" Going to lunch with coworkers today , " she noted . 
" Have a feeling I was invitedas the new star of <ORGANIZATION>Hot Office Gossip</ORGANIZATION> , like a press conference . " 
After lunch , thenews about her evening spread . 
" The boss who pimped me out to [ the committee staffer ] just stopped by , " Jessicawrote in her blog at <TIME>2:02 p.m.</TIME> on <DATE>May 7</DATE> . 
" She mentioned that [ he ] is verydiscreet , so I am taking that as a hint to keep quiet . 
Finally , she asked me ifI would say yes if he asked me out again . 
I told her that I would . 
So it lookslike I might have another boyfriend . 
I hope this does not end badly . 
" Before her workday ended , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> made a date with a man she said was a rich , older <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown</ORGANIZATION> lawyer . 
At <TIME>6:38 p.m.</TIME> <ORGANIZATION>Jessica</ORGANIZATION> posted a new blog entry , announcing " This is the plan : " Take a cab over to the rich lawyer 's place inGeorgetown . 
Have sex . 
Get dinner someplace expensive . 
Get the lawyer to driveher home to Capitol Hill . 
Go to a keg party at the house of a co-worker fromDeWine 's office . 
Maybe have sex with somebody new there . 
" Get 8 hours sleep , " she concluded.Her tone was cavalier as usual . 
But her <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> date with the <PERSON>Georgetownlawyer</PERSON> turned out to be dreadful , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> reported in her blog . 
He wanted a kindof sex that physically hurt <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> . 
Only this time , for a change , Jessicarefused , and the lawyer became so belligerent that she went home without evengetting an expensive dinner out of the deal . 
The next night , she went out withher girlfriends and got so drunk that she passed out on her floor . 
Come Mondaymorning , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> struggled to make any of it sound remotely funny . 
" I am done with [ him ] , for real this time , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> posted on <DATE>Monday</DATE> , <DATE>May 10</DATE> . 
" The whole situation depressed me so much , I turned down a free dinner and askedhim to take me home . 
He peeled off a few hundred from that roll of cash hecarries around , and put the hundreds in my hand as I was getting out of the car.I acted indignant , like I do n't need his help , but I kept it : why punishmyself ? 
" Less than an hour later , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> 's blog announced a change of plans regardingthe lawyer . 
He " just e-mailed me , ' How was your weekend ? 
Thinking of you ! ' 
" <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> noted . 
" Ugh . 
I wrote back , ' From now on , we should go out drinkingbefore we go back to your place . 
I think that would improve everything . ' 
I knowI said it was ' over , ' but it 's not like it matters either way . 
What can I say , <ORGANIZATION>Ilike</ORGANIZATION> money . 
" The lawyer was n't the only man giving her cash . 
She 'd been meeting a marriedBush appointee in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> hotels for months . 
She genuinely liked him , shesays . 
The first time he handed her an envelope with cash in it she says she wassurprised , grateful and more than a little embarrassed . 
" I was n't a hookercharging him , " she insists . 
" I felt guilty about the money , " she says . 
" The whole premise for that was thathe 's married , we can not go out together , we can not be seen together , there 's nofuture . . . So the money was like consideration for that . 
It was really like agift . 
Unfortunately , I became dependent on that income . " 
She was only earning <MONEY>$ 25,000</MONEY> a year , she says . 
How could anyone live on that?Jessica 's friends were n't shocked by her talk of sex for money . 
They knew shewas writing about it in the most exaggerated , offhand way possible to amusethem , and they were n't about to judge her . 
" It sounds bad , but it 's really aperspective thing , " <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> says . 
" These were guys were giving her money forreasons of their own . 
She never asked them for money . 
She never said , ' If I dothis , you give me that . ' 
" Although <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> was n't outraged , she was confused . 
She could n't keep all themen in <LOCATION>Jessica</LOCATION> 's blog straight . 
She suggested <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> post some kind of guide . 
" By popular demand , I have finally created a key to keeping my sex lifestraight , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> wrote on the <TIME>afternoon</TIME> of <DATE>May 11</DATE> . " 
After producing a briefdescription of each man identified by his initials , she lamented : " I 'm [ havingsex with ] six guys . 
Ewww . 
" ON FRIDAY , MAY 14 , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> informed her readers that her former steady boyfriendhad visited her apartment the night before and discovered evidence that she wasstill cheating on him . 
" He will probably never speak to me again , " she wrote . 
" Ifeel bad about what I did to [ him ] and I feel like our relationship deservesmore than a short write-off , but we both need to move on . . . So I called [ thecommittee staffer ] after [ my old steady ] left in a huff . 
I ended up sleepingover in <LOCATION>Bethesda</LOCATION> for the third night in a row . 
He wants us to get testedtogether so we can stop using condoms . 
Is n't that sweet ? 
Hope I do n't haveanything ! 
So I do n't know if it 's getting serious or what . 
We 're seeing eachother every day now . 
I like him very much and he likes me . 
But can it goanywhere , i.e. marriage ? 
I do n't know . 
He 's Jewish , I 'm not . . . But we worktogether , so there is an incentive to stay together and avoid an awkwardbreakup . 
And after a few months , people around the office will start ' hearingwedding bells . ' 
I really just want to be a Jewish housewife with a big rock onmy finger . 
" They had been dating one week.In <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> , <PERSON>DeLuca</PERSON> was starting to think the impossible : <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> might justsettle down with the committee staffer . 
" Right before all this happened , she wason the phone to me saying , ' <PERSON>Allie</PERSON> , I 'm really crazy about this guy . 
I know it ' sonly been a week , but I 'm not going to see anybody else . ' " 
Jessica was eventhinking about giving up the blog , she told her friend <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> : If she wasgoing to go steady , the blog could get pretty boring.Jessica had a previously set lunch date for her birthday . 
She was meeting themarried <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration official at a hotel . 
" I just took a long lunch with [ him ] and made a quick <MONEY>$ 400</MONEY> , " she posted at <TIME>2:10 p.m.</TIME> on <DATE>May 18</DATE> . 
" When Ireturned to the office , I heard that my boss was asking about my whereabouts.Loser . 
" She dreaded tackling the boring stack of mail on her desk . 
So she went to theSenate cafeteria to get a cup of coffee . 
It was her birthday , after all.She had n't been back at her desk more than a few minutes before the two instantmessages popped up on her screen in rapid succession : " Oh my God , you 're famous . " 
" Your blog is on Wonkette . 
" Plenty of people in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> believe <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> was angling for a book contractfrom her first blog entry and engineered Wonkette 's discovery of the blog.Jessica says that 's not true , and Wonkette , aka <PERSON>Ana Marie Cox</PERSON> , backs her up.Wonkette received an anonymous tip about the blog , <ORGANIZATION>Cox</ORGANIZATION> says . 
" I have no reason to believe that <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> was the tipster , " Cox writes in ane-mail . 
" I suppose it 's possible that <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> is some kind of a publicity geniusand engineered the entire thing without my knowing , but if she was thatbrilliant , then she probably would not have had to have gentleman callers helpsubsidize her income . 
She 'd be the PR rep for <PERSON>Kenneth</PERSON> Lay or something . 
" Cox , who is 31 and lives in <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> , did n't get a book deal out of thescandal , but traffic on her site exploded , with more than 1.5 million visits inMay . 
All the attention did n't hurt . 
Wonkette was hired to cover the recentDemocratic <ORGANIZATION>National Convention</ORGANIZATION> for MTV.JESSICA IS DRESSED IN WHITE . 
She walks through her all-white apartment . 
She is avision of American purity : pure commerce . 
Dress by Gap . 
Bedding by MarthaStewart.On the kitchen counter there is an empty bottle of <ORGANIZATION>Southern Comfort</ORGANIZATION> . 
On a shelfsits a pop art portrait of <PERSON>Jackie Kennedy</PERSON> . 
Jessica evokes another iconic female : <PERSON>Holly Golightly</PERSON> , the heroine of " Breakfast at <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany 's</ORGANIZATION> . " 
" There are certain shades of limelight that can ruin a girl 's complexion , " shesays , quoting the book she read in high school . 
" That 's how I feel . 
Ca n't get ajob . 
Ca n't get a boyfriend . 
And this did ruin my complexion because I ' mdehydrated . 
" While <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> was on a recent stroll with girlfriends , some guy recognized herand yelled , " Hey , Washingtonienne . " 
That was kind of cool . 
In bars , men ask herif she 's <PERSON>Jessica Cutler</PERSON> , then give her their business cards and tell her tocall.Jessica has an agent . 
She 's busy writing her novel . 
" It 's kind of ' The DevilWears Prada , ' only set in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , " she says . 
" I ca n't say how it turns outbecause my agent would kill me . 
" She ca n't fathom how her own story will end.It 's <TIME>10 p.m.</TIME> on a <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> . 
She is going out . 
On the way to <PERSON>Saki</PERSON> , an AdamsMorgan nightclub , <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> seems uncharacteristically forlorn . 
" I had sixboyfriends , and now none of the guys really want to have anything to do withme , " she says . 
" I guess none of them really cared about me in the first place . 
" She 's embarrassed about posting that gushy stuff on her blog about wanting to bea Jewish wife with a rock on her hand . 
Reading that now makes her feel veryexposed . 
Really , she says , she ca n't quite imagine a life of matrimonial bondsand monogamy . 
" I think people are -- and this is n't something I came up with , I heard itsomewhere -- people are as faithful as their options , " she says . 
" If you thinkthere 's no chance of getting caught or something , you 'll do it . 
I 'm sure noteveryone is like that . 
I know that I 'm that way . 
" Outside the nightclub , there is a line of people waiting to get in . 
Jessica , whois being followed by a photographer snapping her picture for this story , sweepspast the line and heads for the bar in the basement of the club.She has friends there waiting for her in a coveted corner table . 
The table is aperk some deejay has arranged . 
He sits next to <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> . 
The club is loud . 
Thethumping music and flashing lights are jarring . 
Jessica looks self-conscious asthe photographer snaps frame after frame of her.Before long , a hostess gives <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> , her friends and the deejay some bad news : They are being dumped from their corner table . 
" Somebody who is going to spend alot of money wants it , " <PERSON>Jessica</PERSON> says.She shrugs . 
" I never had a table before . "
