The good times - at least for political reporters and pundits - are pretty muchover . 
It has been a wonderfully wacky GOP primary fight , with endless debatesand new front-runners du jour.Conservative Republicans were saying " anyone but Romney . " 
Reporters were rootingfor " everyone and Romney . 
" But the post-New Hampshire reality is setting in.Texas Gov. <PERSON>Rick Perry</PERSON> got 1,766 votes in <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> . 
That 's out of nearly aquarter of a million votes cast . 
A whopping <PERCENT>0.7 percent</PERCENT> . 
( He beat <PERSON>Herman Cain</PERSON> , who had already dropped out , by only 1,600 votes . ) 
Seems pretty certain that the implausible <PERSON>Perry</PERSON> , who gave us that historic " oops " moment that the press milked for weeks , is gone.We 've already lost the always fun Rep. <PERSON>Michele Bachmann</PERSON> and her delightfulhusband . 
Ditto for <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> , the former Godfather 's Pizza CEO , who , in addition toallegations of serious sexual misconduct - which , by the way , we naturallychased after - treated us to that hilarious appearance before the <ORGANIZATION>MilwaukeeJournal Sentinel</ORGANIZATION> editorial board . 
Who can forget him trying to focus on theright <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> - as opposed to that other one - and to get control of " all of thisstuff twirling around in my head . 
" Former <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> governor <PERSON>Jon Huntsman</PERSON> was n't exactly Mr. Excitement , but he provideda little ballast at times . 
He came in a disappointing third after practicallymoving from <LOCATION>Kalorama</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> for the past few months.Even worse , he 's now trailing comedian <PERSON>Stephen Colbert</PERSON> in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> - thenext primary , on <DATE>Jan. 21</DATE> - with <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> to <PERSON>Colbert</PERSON> 's <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> in ahypothetical matchup , according to a <ORGANIZATION>Public Policy Polling.Former House</ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON>Newt Gingrich</PERSON> , despite the <ORGANIZATION>New Hampshire Union</ORGANIZATION> Leader ' sfull-throated endorsement , got only <PERCENT>9.4 percent</PERCENT> of the vote , tied with formersenator <PERSON>Rick Santorum</PERSON> . 
Both of them look to be on the ropes now - <ORGANIZATION>Newt</ORGANIZATION> 's bravadonotwithstanding.And the 76-year-old Rep. <PERSON>Ron Paul</PERSON> ( R-Tex . ) 
may hang in there a bit longer , buthe came in more than 16 points behind Romney on Tuesday.There 's plenty of big money around , so candidates will probably stagger on , butthey might as well invite country singer <PERSON>Lucinda Williams</PERSON> to the <DATE>Monday</DATE> debatein <LOCATION>Myrtle Beach</LOCATION> to sing a line from an old hit : " It 's over - I know it , but <ORGANIZATION>Ica</ORGANIZATION> n't let go . 
" Republicans and reporters may be in denial , but the reality is , barring somemiracle , it 's going to be the boring , awkward Mitt against the used <PERSON>Barack</PERSON> - nolonger the champion of hopey-changey . 
Well , there 's always Casey Anthony.We watch for youWe screened the debut episode of former senator <ORGANIZATION>Arlen Specter</ORGANIZATION> 's new TV show , which airs <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> , and we 've saved you the half-hour with this roundup ofhighlights.First , the real star of the show is n't the former <ORGANIZATION>Senate Judiciary Committeechairman</ORGANIZATION> and his ambling ruminations on money in politics , but rather formersenator <PERSON>Fred Thompson</PERSON> 's beard . 
" The Law & Order " actor - one of Specter 's guests - sports a hipster-esquesalt-and-pepper goatee that we thought was the most newsworthy feature of thetalk show.The snappiest line of the program , which airs on <ORGANIZATION>Maryland Public Television</ORGANIZATION> , came courtesy of former senator <PERSON>Evan Bayh</PERSON> ( R-Ind . ) 
. 
" An immaculatecontribution , " <PERSON>Bayh</PERSON> dubbed a political donation that does n't affect a lawmaker ' svote.Zing!Also , look out for folks you know among the viewer audience ( ooh , look , it ' sNina Totenberg ! ) 
that Specter periodically questions , Oprah-style ( spoileralert : they do n't all win trips to <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> ) . 
The effect is that of an early PBS talk show , complete with Specter looking atthe wrong camera , odd musical interludes and an <PERSON>Edward R. Murrow-like</PERSON> sign-off . 
And if all this does n't sound fascinating enough , may we suggest turning theresolutely sober program into a drinking game ? 
Take a sip every time anyone says " Citizens United , " " money " or " politics . " 
Do a shot any time Specter cracks asmile or the phrase " stare decisis " is uttered.Who says this is n't must-see-TV ? 
Poisoned ? 
Well . . . President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's decision last week to override the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and make recessappointments ticked off Republicans - and now , let the Hill aftershockscommence!One possible victim of the sour mood caused by the recess appointments is aheretofore innocuous bipartisan bill that would streamline the Senateconfirmation process.The bill , which is aimed at making the notoriously lumbering chamber moreefficient by reducing the number of presidential appointees requiring a Senatevote , cleared the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> back in <DATE>July</DATE> . 
Since then , it 's been languishing in theHouse.And now we 're hearing that the bill might never see the light of day.The subject of confirmations has turned toxic on Capitol Hill , where Republicansin both chambers are smarting from <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's end run around <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Republicans ' gambit to keep the president from making recess appointments by technicallykeeping the chamber in session - even though the " sessions " lasted mere secondseach <ORGANIZATION>day.The Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> this week backed up <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's strategy , saying it wasperfectly within his authority.But not everyone on the Hill agrees . 
" The president pretty much poisoned the well on the whole subject matter , " saysone Republican staffer . 
" If you bring that bill up now you 'd get a big fight . 
" Advocates for the bill were hoping for smoother sailing . 
They anticipated theHouse would simply pass the bill in deference to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> - since <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> GOPleaders backed it , and because it deals solely with the business of " the upperchamber . " 
" This should be the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> 's prerogative , and we would hope that the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> woulddefer to that judgment , " says <PERSON>Max Stier</PERSON> , president of the Partnership for <ORGANIZATION>PublicService</ORGANIZATION> , a bipartisan good-government group.While that might - might - have been the case just a few weeks ago , it ' scertainly not now.Breaking news!The president , speaking at a fundraiser <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> at a private home inChicago , unloaded this bombshell : <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> , according to the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> transcript , talked about " The first bill Isigned - a bill that said that we 're going to have equal pay for equal workbecause I want my daughters treated the same way as my sons . 
" Sons ? 
What sons ? 
How many ? 
Where ? 
Names ? 
Do the girls know ? 
( More important , does <PERSON>Michelle</PERSON> ? )
