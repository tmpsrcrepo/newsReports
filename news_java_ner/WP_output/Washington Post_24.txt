<PERSON>Jameis Winston</PERSON> is the embodiment of the big-time college athlete who can dowhatever he damn well pleases as long as he remains the greatest economic engineon campus.Jimbo <PERSON>Fisher</PERSON> is the embodiment of the big-time college coach who is not really aleader of men but actually a follower of arrested locker-room <ORGANIZATION>development.Florida State</ORGANIZATION> football and <LOCATION>Tallahassee</LOCATION> law enforcement are the embodiment of howathletic revenue transforms universities into institutions of higher corruption.You ca n't follow the two-year odyssey of Winston and come away with any otherconclusion : Heisman trophies and national championships give superior athletesimmunity from real-life consequences for their actions.This learned culture of entitlement bleeds down from the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Ray Rice</PERSON> , through the <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> panhandle and then trickles all the way to the high schoollevel in <LOCATION>Sayreville</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION> That 's where seven adolescent boys were arrested lastFriday on charges stemming from sick hazing rituals that allegedly involved thesodomizing of " teammates " - and where some parents and coaches could n't believethey canceled the rest of the varsity football season because ( horrors ) theBombers ' streak of 20 straight postseason appearances would end.This is the part of Football in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> that gets edited out . 
This is our newnational pastime.Winston will start at quarterback for <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> in college football 's gameof the week against <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> . 
I predict he will start theremainder of his team 's games this season , too , because no <ORGANIZATION>FSU</ORGANIZATION> complianceofficer interested in further employment with the university would declareWinston ineligible while investigating the sophomore star for the latestallegation against him : swapping autographs for cash.In further evidence of the game 's twisted values , this claim may be the mostserious yet - because criminal behavior toward women and irresponsible prankssuch as firing BB guns on campus or stealing food from a supermarket isconsidered nothing compared to trying to profit personally off your own exploitsthat generate <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> for others . 
Now that 's criminal , son.Fisher says Famous Jameis is innocent , and except when he and the school arepublicly embarrassed into taking action , <PERSON>Fisher</PERSON> always says Famous Jameis isinnocent - whether he 's being accused of trying to make a little coin on theside or something far more serious , such as last year 's sexual assaultinvestigation.Winston could join <ORGANIZATION>ISIS</ORGANIZATION> and contract Ebola tomorrow , and you feel like Fisherwould tell you he was trying on a Halloween costume and had a sore throat beforesending him out to take on the Fighting Irish.The coach , who has lost just 10 times in 41 / 2 years and is 4-0 in bowl gamesafter replacing the legendary but hardly saintly <PERSON>Bobby Bowden</PERSON> , oversees aprogram with at least nine players arrested in the past three years on chargesfrom sexual assault to being an accessory to a fatal shooting , the New YorkTimes reported last week.Fisher 's continued support shows he needs <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> more than <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> needs <ORGANIZATION>him.Florida State</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Tallahassee</LOCATION> need Winston more than he needs them . 
Never wasthat imbalance of power and leverage more clear than last season beforeprosecutors decided to drop a rape investigation against <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> , deciding therewas n't enough evidence to bring charges.Fact : The athletic department made sure <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> 's attorney had the investigationreport before the state attorney did . 
By the time the state prosecutor 's officegot it , <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> 's attorney got copycat affidavits from his roommates to say thesex was consensual . 
His defense was set before the proper authorities even knewof the case.Fact : The investigating officer , <PERSON>Scott Angulo</PERSON> , has done private security workfor the <ORGANIZATION>Seminole Boosters</ORGANIZATION> , a nonprofit claiming , oh , <MONEY>$ 150 million</MONEY> in assets , <ORGANIZATION>theNew York Times</ORGANIZATION> reported last <DATE>spring</DATE> . 
Seminole Boosters is the main financialpipeline to <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> athletics.The lawyer for <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> 's accuser said the investigating officer who handled thecase told her that her client would be " raked over the coals " if she wentforward with the case - because down there in the panhandle , they take crackinghelmets seriously.The entire affair - <ORGANIZATION>Winston</ORGANIZATION> 's entire college career , really - shows how thesystem failed everyone , how star athletes are inoculated from repercussions fortheir actions at the cost of the institutions they represent . 
And it 's the samecorrosion afflicting the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> and a high school football powerhouse in NewJersey.Here 's a window into what Winston learned from that investgation : A month or soafter prosecutors decided not to charge him , he and a teammate posted anInstagram video of themselves singing a verse from a rap song called " On theFloor . " 
It 's about men who proceed after hearing the word " No " from women.Sample lyric : " She said she wants to take it slow . 
I 'm not that type of guy I ' llletcha know . 
When I see that red light all I know is go . 
" I do n't know whether Winston sexually assaulted a woman or the sex wasconsensual . 
No one knows but the people in that room.I do know that , through their handling of the investigation , <LOCATION>Tallahassee</LOCATION> policeand the university made it all but impossible to find out.I do know for all of <ORGANIZATION>Jameis Winston</ORGANIZATION> 's rotten decision-making off the field , hedid make one important one as an 18-year-old that propelled him toward the NFLyet prevented him from genuine human development : He decided to play football atFlorida <ORGANIZATION>State</ORGANIZATION> , where he would never be told no - and if even he was , no onewould ever find out about it.mike.wise@washpost.comFor more by <PERSON>Mike Wise</PERSON> , visit washingtonpost.com/wise .
