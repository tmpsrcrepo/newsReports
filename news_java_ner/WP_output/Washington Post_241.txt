In recent decades , most of us have watched our workplace became more tolerant , less biased , more sensitive to differences of ethnicity , gender , age , religionand sexual orientation . 
American laws changed to reflect our greaterenlightenment as a society . 
Some still resist out of anger , ignorance or evil.But , in our time as in most ages , we 've watched incremental progress arrive.Industries change at different paces . 
But the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> lags by a generation . 
Profootball needs to transform its workplace and finally join the rest of us . 
Ifthe experience of millions of us , including my memories of the turmoil innewspaper sports departments 40 years ago , is an indication of what 's in store , the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> workplace will shift as much in the next five years as it has in thelast 50 . 
Whether the issue is vicious hazing of <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> rookies , or trouble accepting anopenly gay player , or the league 's lies and cynicism in hiding its knowledge ofbrain damage to its ex-players , time is finally up . 
It 's the two-minute warningfor a commissioner who 's been an <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> man half his life.Even nicknames give away the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> mind-set . 
Where else would a billion-dollarbusiness proclaim that it will " NEVER - you can use caps " change a name and logothat offends many , including plenty of its own customers . 
When the wind shifts , all the leaves blow the same direction . 
A nickname , in the bigger scheme , is aleaf.You can be on the wrong side of history for decades , then in a few years - andthe last few months have brought all these issues into the open or into focus - find yourself a victim of that history if you do n't change in time . 
A pointcomes when things are finally called by their proper names.A day always comes when intolerance is no longer tolerated . 
The time arriveswhen sadistic malice , rationalized as brotherly " bonding , " is no longer allowed.And eventually our courts rule against decades of lies about employee healthissues ; then corporate stonewalls are reduced to rubble.Recently , three names in the news have highlighted ways in which the NFLenvironment is ridiculously , comically behind the rest of American society : <PERSON>Richie Incognito</PERSON> , <PERSON>Michael Sam</PERSON> and Judge Anita Brody.As revealed in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> 's own 144-page report this month , Incognito is thebully-in-chief among <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> Dolphins players and coaches who viciously hazedseveral young players with sexual taunts about their female relatives , racialslurs , inappropriate touching and homophobic insults . 
" He looks like he 's about to cry 24/7 , " Incognito wrote , describing one of hisvictims in a text to a <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> assistant line coach.The coach replied , " Hahahaha . 
He 's gon na go crazy one of these days . 
" Makes you want to line up for an <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> autograph , does n't it?The problem is n't Incognito . 
Apparently , he just continued a Dolphins tradition.According to the <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Herald</ORGANIZATION> , lineman <PERSON>Nate Garner</PERSON> texted to bullying targetJonathan Martin : " Hey bro if u need to talk to anyone I 'm here for you . 
I havebeen dealing with this ( bleep ) for 6 years . 
I hope ur doin ok . " 
Like theStanford grad <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> , <PERSON>Garner</PERSON> was ostracized because he dared to show he had abrain : He liked computers and electronics.Into this world <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> , the all-American linebacker from <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> , will soon step.The <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> is , officially , breaking its back to salute his " courage " for comingout . 
But is <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> really the only franchise hostile to gays?The <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> has become so concerned about tolerance that its competition committeeis considering a 15-yard penalty for discriminatory language on the field . 
Someof that stems from an incident last season involving a racial slur used againstAfrican Americans in a game . 
Perhaps it 's a useful coincidence that such a rulemight arrive in <LOCATION>Sam</LOCATION> 's first season.But more than any of its many recent scandals and embarrassments , Judge <PERSON>Brodymay</PERSON> shake the league to its core . 
Last month , she threw back the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> 's <MONEY>$ 765million</MONEY> concussion settlement with its retired players . 
When ex-players acceptedthat class-action settlement , some analysts said it was many hundreds ofmillions too low to cover everyone who might deserve payments . 
The ex-playerswere getting old ; the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> lawyers could fight them until they were in theirgraves , so they took what they could get.Brody said nuts to that . 
A class of 20,000 players might be qualified forsettlements of <MONEY>$ 3.5 million</MONEY> for Parkinson 's or <MONEY>$ 5 million</MONEY> for amyotrophiclateral sclerosis , commonly known as <PERSON>Lou Gehrig</PERSON> 's disease . 
What about playerswho killed themselves after suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( alifetime of football hits in the head ) ? 
If even <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of 20,000 deserved payments , who said <MONEY>$ 765 million</MONEY> wassufficient ? 
You guessed it : The <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> did . 
Or their " economists " did.And what actual proof did they provide to <PERSON>Brody</PERSON> ? 
" No such analyses were providedto me , " she wrote . 
" In the absence of . . . evidence , I have concerns about thefairness , reasonableness , and adequacy of the Settlement . 
" Millions of us could testify to how fast a workplace alters when the tides of aculture finally shift . 
I offer mine simply because parts of the sportsdepartments of 40 years ago were typical of countless workplaces of the time . 
Asa copy boy on the lobster shift until <TIME>2 a.m.</TIME> , what I observed was no worse , butno better , than countless other workplaces - like openly discriminatory jokes.One night the departing editors jammed the youngest reporter into a narrow coatlocker as they left at <TIME>2 a.m</TIME> . 
A night watchman heard him screaming and let himout . 
Nobody was scolded - just hazing.What stunned me was that these old-timers had no idea they were an endangeredspecies that would soon be swept out of <ORGANIZATION>The Post</ORGANIZATION> and the profession . 
Once acultural corner is turned , the new direction is established at amazing speed.The <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> culture is dug in deep . 
When <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> came out , national TV commentatorscongratulated him and then , without knowing what they were saying , characterizedhis action as " admitting " he was gay.An ex-NFL head coach wondered if teams might avoid drafting <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> because mediaattention would make him a " distraction . " 
That coach is an African American ; would he have said that the '47 <ORGANIZATION>Brooklyn Dodgers</ORGANIZATION> should have paused to considerwhat a " distraction " <PERSON>Jackie Robinson</PERSON> would be?My advice to the dinosaurs of the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> would be the same that virtually everykind of American workplace has learned : Change or disappear.Progress does n't just arrive .
