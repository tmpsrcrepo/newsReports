OUR <PERSON>Mauricio</PERSON> ? 
No way , man . 
He did n't have any problem with women , " said one of the intense chess guys at <ORGANIZATION>Dupont Circle</ORGANIZATION> when I told him the news.Yes , even a guy who is good looking , charming , has studied at universities inthree different countries , makes beautiful food and is a skilled chess playercan , according to police , be a creep.Their <PERSON>Mauricio</PERSON> is Oscar <PERSON>Mauricio Cornejo-Pena</PERSON> , 30 , a Nicaraguan immigrantcurrently in the <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> jail , accused of being this <DATE>summer</DATE> 's notorious bike-ridinggroper . 
According to his Facebook page and friends who worked and played chess with him , <PERSON>Mauricio</PERSON> went to culinary school , likes Ping-Pong , " That '70s Show , " " Sex andthe City " and French cuisine . 
And according to a seven-page court affidavit , healso rode around the <ORGANIZATION>Dupont Circle</ORGANIZATION> area on his bike this <DATE>summer</DATE> , violatedunsuspecting women while laughing at them , and then sped away.Cornejo-Pena clinked into court <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> , in chains and an orangejumpsuit , his baby face now covered by a beard . 
He kept scanning the courtroomover his shoulder , looking for anyone he might know.Individually , the attacks carry a pretty small penalty . 
According to the D.C.Official Code , the groper can be jailed for " not more than 180 days , and , inaddition , may be fined in an amount not to exceed <MONEY>$ 1,000</MONEY> . " 
A misdemeanor akin toselling a fake <ORGANIZATION>Gucci</ORGANIZATION> purse or being a spectator at a cockfight.But if <ORGANIZATION>Cornejo-Pena</ORGANIZATION> is found guilty of all five counts of misdemeanor sexualabuse with aggravating circumstances - the multiple victims being whataggravates the circumstances - he could get up to 3 years and 8Â ½ months , according to <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney 's office spokesman Bill Miller.But that is n't even his biggest legal problem.His bail was set at just <MONEY>$ 100</MONEY> because he is n't going anywhere . 
<ORGANIZATION>U.S. Immigrationand Customs Enforcement</ORGANIZATION> has a detainer on him , meaning ICE tagged him fordeportation because he is in this country without proper documentation , according to court testimony.Actually , it did n't take an arrest for one local restaurateur to figure thatout.A woman who nearly hired Cornejo-Pena , but wanted to remain anonymous , told methat she would have made him a bartender . 
She found him " quite charming , " andhis rsum included work at trendy hot spots all over town.But when she ran him through E-Verify , she found him quite unemployable in <LOCATION>theUnited States</LOCATION> . 
His legal work status did n't check out.Police said he was working at the <ORGANIZATION>St. Regis</ORGANIZATION> hotel on 16th Street NW at the timeof his arrest . 
The human resources department there hung up on me when I askedabout him and whether the hotel had noticed any problems with his legal workstatus or his treatment of women.Cornejo-Pena 's attorney , <PERSON>Lisbeth Sapirstein</PERSON> , twice told me that she did n't wantto comment about him or the case . 
I followed her down a courthouse hallway , asking whether there are friends or relatives who might want to talk with meabout him . 
" Nobody wants to talk , nobody , " she said.Yeah , I can guess this is hard to talk about.Of course , Cornejo-Pena has not been found guilty of anything yet . 
But after hewas picked up by police , Cornejo-Pena not only admitted to the attacks thatpolice asked him about and positively identified himself on video , according toa court document , but he also volunteered a few more incidents that were n't ontheir radar.And given what he said , I can see why the people who know him are shocked.Sexual predators , molesters and harassers are rarely who you think they are.They 're not always seething and scary and tattooed , like in the movies.The villain can be a much-admired mentor , like <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> 's <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky</PERSON> . 
Or apowerful <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> senator , like <PERSON>Robert Packwood</PERSON> . 
Or a caring , charismatic teacher , like <PERSON>Kevin Ricks</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eric Justin Toth</PERSON> . 
Or a respectedswim coach like <PERSON>Rick Curl.On</PERSON> his Facebook page , <ORGANIZATION>Cornejo-Pena</ORGANIZATION> 's got a profile picture of himself with apretty young woman in his lap , a group photo of him with other culinary schoolstudents and a photo of him in a white uniform , wearing hipster glasses andholding up an elegant plate of food.He clearly comes from a family of means , having gone to universities in ElSalvador and Panama.When he was first arrested , he was n't given a court-appointed attorney becausehe made too much money . 
He 's got friends and family , most of whom appear to bein his home country , <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> , who post sweet comments about his photos.Maybe Cornejo-Pena will have more to say when he returns to court.But right now , most everyone around him remains speechless.dvorakp@washpost.comTwitter:@petuladTo read previous columns , go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak .
