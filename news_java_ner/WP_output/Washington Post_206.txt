Shortly after <TIME>midnight</TIME> <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in his bedroom at <LOCATION>Ramstein Air Base</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Randy Phillips</PERSON> set up his Web camera , dialed his cellphone and called his fatherin <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> . 
" Can I tell you something ? " 
<PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> , 21 , asked , with the camera rolling . 
" Willyou love me , serious ? 
Like , you 've always loved me , as long as I live ? " 
" Yes , " his father said.His voice dropping , <PERSON>Phillips</PERSON> told him : " Dad , I 'm gay . " 
" Yikes , " his father replied . 
" I still love you , and I will always love you , and I will always be proud ofyou , " his father said later.This is what the end of the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy brought - hundreds , if not thousands , of quiet , personal exchanges with family members , friends , and supportive colleagues who had long suspected they knew . 
Some gayservice members took to podiums on Capitol Hill or attended parties and " comingout " ceremonies.But several issues remain unresolved , including the granting of equal benefitsto same-sex partners and how gay soldiers will be accepted in their units . 
ThePentagon , which appeared eager to declare victory and move on , said it wouldwork within current federal law to address lingering concerns.Tuesday , though , was about relief and recognition.In a Facebook posting , <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON>Michael D. Jason</PERSON> summed it up for many inthe military . " 
' Do n't Ask Do n't Tell ' repealed today , " he wrote . 
" The American citizen hasasked some of us to fight for them . 
We volunteered . 
Now , as proclaimed by law , stay out of my Soldiers ' bedrooms . 
About time . 
" For <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Staff Sgt. <PERSON>John Tegeler</PERSON> , the end of the ban on gays in uniformmeant he could walk into his office at <LOCATION>Ramstein</LOCATION> beaming on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> . 
" One of my co-workers asked why I had such a big smile on my face , " he said . 
" Then she said , ' Oh , yes , I know why . ' 
" But the day was not without worrying reminders that homophobic attitudes in themilitary are unlikely to vanish.Tegeler said straight troops still cracked jokes he found somewhat offensive , apparently not realizing that a gay airman was present . 
" There are a lot of people who can not adapt and overcome change , " said Tegeler ,27 . 
" But I laughed it off . 
I have a thick skin . 
" In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Marine</ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON>Sarah Pezzat</PERSON> 's voice cracked as she spoke to a roomfull of reporters and supportive senators on Capitol Hill . 
" I 'm 31 years old , I 'm a <ORGANIZATION>United States Marine</ORGANIZATION> , and I 'm a lesbian , " she said , fighting back tears.Although she had disagreed with the military on its ban on gays , " I could n'tcompletely leave it . " 
And now as she prepares to deploy overseas , she said , " Ido n't have to shove my family back into the closet . 
" Sen. <PERSON>Susan Collins</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> ) , a key Republican backer of repeal efforts , joinedPezzat to read from a postcard she received in <DATE>June</DATE> from a soldier serving inAfghanistan . 
" Thank you for your courage to vote in favor of repeal as a Republican , " thepostcard said . 
" I will repay your courage with continued professionalism . 
" <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> lamented that she may never know who sent her the postcard , signedsimply " An Army Soldier . 
" But , <PERSON>Collins</PERSON> noted , " today he can sign his name , and that makes all thedifference . 
" Despite <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> 's milestone , there is growing concern among gay troops thattheir partners are still denied access to the housing and health benefitsprovided to heterosexual military spouses . 
Activists are also shifting focus tothe unknown number of transgender troops serving in uniform without formalrecognition . 
And some troops feared that repealing the gay ban might createtensions for tightknit units upset that some members are still facinginequities . 
" I think it 's going to bother commanders , and troops who see their friends beingtreated differently , " said <PERSON>Josh Seefried</PERSON> , who for several years used thepseudonym " <PERSON>J.D. Smith</PERSON> " in leading OutServe , an underground network of gaytroops.At the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Leon E. Panetta</PERSON> assured skeptics that themilitary would have " zero tolerance with regards to harassment " and would relyon current standards of discipline to handle adverse situations.As for further changes that would benefit same-sex couples , Adm. <PERSON>Mike Mullen</PERSON> , chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Joint Chiefs of Staff</ORGANIZATION> , noted that the <ORGANIZATION>Defense of Marriage Actprohibits</ORGANIZATION> the military from equalizing benefits for them . 
" We follow the lawhere , " <PERSON>Mullen</PERSON> said . 
" We 're going to follow that law as long as it exists . 
" Critics seized on the concerns raised by troops as further proof that thePentagon rushed to end the gay ban without proper study . 
<PERSON>Elaine Donnelly</PERSON> , avocal opponent of allowing gays in uniform , said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> 's change " is beingimposed on the armed forces to deliver on President <PERSON>Barack Obama</PERSON> 's politicalpromises " to gay rights organizations.The push to end the ban " was fueled by sophistry , administration-coordinateddeception " and fake research compiled by gay activists , <PERSON>Donnelly</PERSON> chargedTuesday.In <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Tegeler</PERSON> and his colleagues were n't focused on critics . 
Theycelebrated the ban 's end with a dinner at a Mexican restaurant near their base.They heard from <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Master Sgt. <PERSON>Kristopher Kobernus</PERSON> , who had recentlyreturned from a deployment to Afghanistan.He told those present at the Cantina Mexican Restaurant in Kaiserslautern of thetime he and a few friends stationed in <LOCATION>Seoul</LOCATION> were arrested for being out aftercurfew . 
They happened to have been at a gay bar , which triggered aninvestigation . 
" Even though I knew there was nothing wrong with being there , I also knew theynow had an idea about my sexuality , " he said . 
" I was scared . " 
He was n'tdischarged , but one of the friends at the bar that night was , in part as aresult of the arrest , he said.Kobernus , 37 , said gay soldiers should celebrate but also brace themselves for along road ahead . 
" When you go to work tomorrow , the next phase of our battle will officiallybegin , " he said . 
" If you decide to come out , the battle for respect amongst yourco-workers . 
The battle for a workplace free from harassment , and a battle toprove that all the stereotypes that have labeled our community are just that .
