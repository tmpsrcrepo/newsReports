GGuys were always peeling off their shirts at punk shows . 
Why could n't she ? 
Â ¶ Itwas <DATE>June 27 , 1991</DATE> , and the District was sweltering . 
Just like <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> the nightbefore . 
Just like <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> the night before that . 
Â ¶ Enough . 
<PERSON>Kathleen Hannamarched</PERSON> on stage wearing a black bra she 'd found at a thrift store , bracingherself for another night of heckles , threats and projectiles.Instead , the singer of Bikini Kill felt the room turn upside down . 
Or maybe , finally , right-side-up . 
Â ¶ " I remember halfway through the show being like , ' People are really getting this , ' " <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> says . 
" It was like they had beenwaiting for us . " 
Â ¶ Outside the District , Bikini Kill was ahead of its time . 
Â ¶ Formed in <LOCATION>Olympia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Wash.</LOCATION> , in <DATE>1990</DATE> , the quartet helped launch riot grrrl , aradical feminist movement that would spread from <ORGANIZATION>Adams Morgan</ORGANIZATION> group houses tothe pages of <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> . 
They coined the term " girl power " in a photocopiedfanzine years before the <ORGANIZATION>Spice Girls</ORGANIZATION> spelled it out in bubble gum . 
They werepals with <ORGANIZATION>Nirvana</ORGANIZATION> before <PERSON>Nirvana</PERSON> was Nirvana . 
( <PERSON>Kurt Cobain</PERSON> took the title for " Smells Like Teen Spirit " from some graffiti that <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> drunkenly scribbled onhis bedroom wall . ) 
They wrote brilliant , abrasive punk salvos that would inspireSleater-Kinney , the Gossip , embattled Russian group Pussy Riot and a generationof others.And when Bikini Kill crash-landed in the <LOCATION>District</LOCATION> 's activist-friendly punk sceneafter a sleepless tour of towns that had never heard rock songs about rape , domestic violence , empowerment and equality , they found a new home . 
" The <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> scene was unapologetically political , " bassist <PERSON>Kathi Wilcox</PERSON> says . 
" Everyone was like , ' We understand your band perfectly . ' 
" Instead of lingering in the back of d.c. space - the now-shuttered venue atSeventh and E streets NW - the girls in the audience rushed to the front to seeBikini Kill 's big splash up close . 
Instead of barking slurs , the guys danced . 
" I can remember exactly where I was standing . 
It was that kind of show , " saysIan MacKaye , then of local punk giants <ORGANIZATION>Fugazi</ORGANIZATION> . 
" The shape of the songs , thepresentation , the charisma was pretty undeniable . 
" Six days later , MacKaye brought the foursome - <LOCATION>Hanna</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Wilcox</PERSON> , guitarist BillyKarren and drummer <PERSON>Tobi Vail</PERSON> , all in their early 20s back then - to <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> ' sInner Ear Studios , where they spent the afternoon recording what would becomethe core of Bikini Kill 's furious debut . 
Released 20 years ago this <DATE>autumn</DATE> , theself-titled EP is being reissued on Tuesday.After the session , the band decided to stick around for the <DATE>summer</DATE> , but ended upliving in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for its most pivotal year , rallying an undergroundcommunity that would ultimately suffocate the band with its impossibleexpectations . 
" We were trying to keep the outside world from killing us , " says <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> , sippinga latte with <PERSON>Wilcox</PERSON> at a <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> cafe on a recent afternoon . 
" So the tensionwithin the band that was n't resolved . . . it came out on stage . 
When you see aband that 's on the verge of falling apart with a really angry lead singer . . . " <PERSON>Wilcox</PERSON> completes the thought , " It 's not boring . 
" The start of riot grrrlWashington 's coffee options were bleak . 
So the transplants endured Folgers fromSafeway until <LOCATION>Vail</LOCATION> 's mom started mailing oversize bags of beans from home . 
Hannaremembers when the first neighborhood <ORGANIZATION>Starbucks</ORGANIZATION> opened , " Everyone was like , ' Corporations are taking over the world ! ' 
and we were like , ' Woo-hoo ! ' 
" That <DATE>summer</DATE> , the members of Bikini Kill would each adapt differently toWashington.Vail passed on being interviewed for this story via e-mail : " I do n't remembermuch about DC except being depressed and homesick . " 
Karren almost never givesinterviews and also declined . 
" For me , it was a homecoming , " <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> says . 
" This was going to be me taking overmy not-so-great history of growing up here . . . . What do you call that?Repetition compulsion ? 
Where it 's like you go back to the scene of the crime , but this time it all works out ? 
" Hanna grew up in the <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> suburbs and in the early days of Bikini Kill , sheonly spoke obliquely about the sexual abuse she suffered as a child . 
During herstudent years at <ORGANIZATION>Evergreen State College</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Olympia</LOCATION> , she worked as a counselorat a domestic violence and rape shelter and continued to counsel fans backstageat Bikini Kill concerts . 
" That 's part of why I wanted to be in a band , " <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> says . 
" I could walk up to a15-year-old and ask her [ switches into nerd-voice ] , ' Would you like to join mysupport group ? ' 
But if I say that from the stage and I 'm in a cool band , they ' regonna come . 
" Fanzines were another way to reach out . 
So one night in early <DATE>July</DATE> , <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> and afew friends gathered around a Capitol Hill <ORGANIZATION>Xerox</ORGANIZATION> machine to run off copies of " Riot Grrrl , " a handmade pamphlet that <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> daydreamed of developing into aglossy magazine about feminism and music.Instead , riot grrrl morphed into an activist group that held regular meetings todiscuss empowerment , organization , safety and support in the punk community . 
Asthe meetings gained momentum in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , participants started exporting theirideas to the rest of the country through a network of pen pals andself-published fanzines.Hanna was eager to spread the word on stage , but she and her bandmates werewaiting on <PERSON>Wilcox</PERSON> . 
The bassist had spent the <DATE>summer</DATE> traveling in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> andMorocco , trying to solve coffee-related conundrums of her own . 
" I remember <PERSON>Kathi</PERSON> bringing back a picture of her using a bikini top as a coffeefilter , " <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> says . 
But by then , the singer had no use for caffeine . 
" I was running on straight adrenaline . 
" The revolutionThe District set a record in <DATE>1991</DATE> with 482 homicides . 
One occurred in a basementapartment not far from the one <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> was renting on <ORGANIZATION>Adams Mill Road NW</ORGANIZATION> . 
Thevictim was a single woman , living alone , just like her . 
Maybe the death threatsthat kept landing in her band 's mailbox were n't something to shrug off . 
" Our home address was published in our fanzine , " <PERSON>Wilcox</PERSON> says . 
" So letters wouldcome like , ' I 'm gon na . . . stab you in the heart . ' 
" At home and on tour , Bikini Kill 's ideals were met with a macho hostility that ' sdifficult to imagine today . 
Transforming fear into motivation became a survivaltactic . 
" The more [ threats ] we got , the more I knew we were on the right trail , " Hannasays . 
" I just kept telling myself , ' We 're on the right side of history . ' 
" <PERSON>Wilcox</PERSON> , <PERSON>Karren</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Vail</LOCATION> were too broke to buy a deadbolt for the group housewhere they were crashing - a three-story rowhouse in <ORGANIZATION>Adams Morgan</ORGANIZATION> dubbed " theEmbassy " by its residents , <ORGANIZATION>Nation of Ulysses</ORGANIZATION> . 
The dazzling punk quintet hadbefriended Bikini Kill out west and toured with them back to the District afterhyping them to friends back home . 
" They were the thing that a lot of people were waiting for , even if they did n'tknow they were waiting for it , " says former Ulysses frontman <PERSON>Ian Svenonius</PERSON> . 
" Ithink I probably encouraged them to move here , but I would never tell peoplethat <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> was some <LOCATION>Haight-Ashbury</LOCATION> . 
" Still , the city 's mythic punk scene was in its second bloom . 
A decade afterMinor Threat and Bad Brains established <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> as the global epicenter ofhardcore punk , <ORGANIZATION>Fugazi , Nation of Ulysses</ORGANIZATION> and dozens of other proudly independentrock bands were earning <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> a vaunted reputation.From the outside , many saw the <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> scene as an alternative to the " alternative " rock universe being peddled on MTV - the Nirvanas and <LOCATION>Pearl Jams</LOCATION> and the like.In the basement of the <ORGANIZATION>Embassy</ORGANIZATION> , Bikini Kill got down to penning some of the mostvital rock-n-roll of the era , including the band 's signature anthem , " RebelGirl . " 
" I remember feeling like that song got pulled out of the air , " <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> says . 
" Witheverything that was happening , it was like , ' I 'm not even writing this , thescene is writing this . ' 
" She sang it back to the scene at Bikini Kill 's biggest <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> show - a July25 , <DATE>1992</DATE> , concert outside <LOCATION>the U.S.</LOCATION> Capitol with <ORGANIZATION>Fugazi</ORGANIZATION> . 
Talk of Anita Hill andDesert Storm had dominated the conversation during Bikini Kill 's year inWashington , but the band rarely addressed national issues head-on . 
Now , thelyrics of " Rebel Girl " were echoing off the Capitol marble : When she talks , I hear the revolution.In her hips , there 's revolution.When she walks , the revolution 's coming.In her kiss , I taste the revolution.Hanna and <PERSON>Wilcox</PERSON> do n't remember revolution arriving that afternoon . 
Theyremember that parking the van was impossible and that bathrooms were really hardto find.Touring and burnoutBikini Kill left the District to tour in <DATE>1992</DATE> and never came back , scattering todifferent cities before finally reconvening in <LOCATION>Olympia</LOCATION> in the mid - <DATE>'90s</DATE> . 
Olympia 's small-towniness felt claustrophobic . 
Everyone had read the articles inSeventeen and <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> , articles about riot grrrl that distorted the movement ' smessage and spun the community into disarray.As the band dodged the media crush , strangers would approach <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> on theOlympia streets , trying to befriend her and blame her for ruining the scene inthe same breath . 
Wilcox calls the band 's final days " a recipe for losing yourmind . 
" Touring was just as disorienting . 
" Our shows felt super schizophrenic becauseyou had girls in the front row singing the lyrics to every single song as if itwas their song that they wrote , " <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> says . 
" And then you had guys who wantedto murder us . 
At the same show ! 
. . . It 's only <MONEY>five dollars</MONEY> to throw a beerbottle at someone 's head , so why not ? 
" But as the group continued its slog , it was impossible not to notice its impact.All across the country , women were starting bands.Jenny <PERSON>Toomey</PERSON> , leader of the veteran <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> indie troupe Tsunami , remembers theshift . 
" Touring before Bikini Kill and after . . . it was drastic , " <PERSON>Toomey</PERSON> says . 
" Sometimes there was a girl playing bass , but you did n't have girls singingtheir stories . 
" Unfortunately , Bikini Kill 's story ended in total burnout . 
Fiercely committed topunk 's do-it-yourself ethos , the band became a cipher with no support system . 
Nomanager . 
No booking agent . 
Not even a roadie . 
" We did n't have the best interpersonal communication skills , " <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> says . 
" Whenyou galvanize against what feels like a hostile exterior , you end up not talkingto each other . 
" Everything finally crumbled in <DATE>1997</DATE> when <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wilcox</PERSON> fled Olympia in aU-Haul cargo van , <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> 's cat riding in a crate between the two front seats.Wilcox hopped out in the <LOCATION>District</LOCATION> , where she was dating <ORGANIZATION>Fugazi</ORGANIZATION> 's Guy Picciotto.Hanna drove south to <LOCATION>Durham</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION> , where she would move in with friends and takejob doing data entry.She left one of the most influential rock bands in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> with <MONEY>$ 400</MONEY> . 
After the breakupIf life in Bikini Kill was interminably tough , life after Bikini Kill wasbriefly devastating . 
" I cried for like a year , " <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> says of the break-up . 
" I just felt like I lostmy family and my band at the same time and I did n't know who I was anymore . 
" <PERSON>Wilcox</PERSON> , however , was eager for anonymity . 
She chopped off her peroxide-blondelocks , started walking dogs in <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> and eventually took a day job where only afew colleagues had ever heard of Bikini Kill - in the newsroom of The <LOCATION>WashingtonPost</LOCATION> , where she worked until <DATE>2006</DATE> . 
( I first met <PERSON>Wilcox</PERSON> when I was hired by The Post in <DATE>2001</DATE> . 
More disclosure : Svenonius is a friend and <ORGANIZATION>MacKaye</ORGANIZATION> is a mentor who released my old band ' srecordings on his label . ) 
Hanna , meantime , was quickly drawn back into the warmth of the spotlight . 
In1998 , she formed the acclaimed electro-pop trio Le Tigre in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> , where shenow lives with her husband , <PERSON>Adam</PERSON> " Ad-Rock " <PERSON>Horovitz</PERSON> of the Beastie Boys.Wilcox now lives in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> , too , and has joined <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> 's new band , the JulieRuin , an extension of <PERSON>Hanna</PERSON> 's old solo project of the same name . 
They ' verecorded an album they hope to drop next year . 
Vail and <PERSON>Karren</PERSON> live in <LOCATION>Olympia</LOCATION> , and all four are still in touch , having recently launched an eponymous label toget the Bikini Kill discography back in circulation . 
" A lot of our band was just survival , " <PERSON>Wilcox</PERSON> says . 
" It was exhausting . 
So whenwe broke up , it took us years to re-fortify . . . . Now , we can finally say , ' Yeah , what we did was important and we 're really proud of it . ' 
And we can keepit in print . 
" As for Bikini Kill 's <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> , it 's hardly recognizable.When the band arrived in the nation 's capital , there were two women in theSenate . 
In <DATE>January</DATE> , there will be 20 . 
Last year , <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> saw its lowestmurder rate since <DATE>1963</DATE> . 
MacKaye , <PERSON>Svenonius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Toomey</PERSON> are still in town , stilldeep in music , but <LOCATION>Fugazi</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Nation of Ulysses</ORGANIZATION> and Tsunami are all long gone . 
Theold d.c. space is even longer gone.Today , it 's a Starbucks.richardsc@washpost.comTo read other interview excerpts from this story , go to washingtonpost.com/style.CORRECTION-DATE: <DATE>December 9</DATE> , 2012CORRECTION : A <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE> Style article about the band Bikini Kill incorrectly said that membersof the band lived in a group house , nicknamed " the <ORGANIZATION>Embassy</ORGANIZATION> , " in Adams Morgan.The house was in <LOCATION>Mount Pleasant</LOCATION> .
