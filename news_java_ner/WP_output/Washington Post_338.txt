<LOCATION>CHARLOTTESVILLE</LOCATION> - WhenVirginia football Coach <PERSON>Mike London</PERSON> caught wind of theunprecedented <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> sanctions levied at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>July</DATE> , his phone would n'tstop ringing.Recruits and coaches from the high school and college ranks wanted to know howthe <ORGANIZATION>Cavaliers</ORGANIZATION> would approach the situation . 
<LOCATION>London</LOCATION> even heard from coachingcolleagues who had already booked tickets on flights to <LOCATION>State College</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION> , inhopes of luring players to transfer to their schools.The <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> created what <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> called an " open market " by suspending transferrestrictions for <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> players who wanted to leave , but the Cavaliersmostlystayed out of that fray . 
Instead , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> preferred to show interest only inNittany Lions recruits they had previously recruited.Even when <ORGANIZATION>Damascus High</ORGANIZATION> linebacker <PERSON>Zach Bradshaw</PERSON> switched his oral commitmentfrom <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> last month , the initial contact in that scenario wasmade by one of <ORGANIZATION>Bradshaw</ORGANIZATION> 's coaches . 
When it came down to it , " You felt bad forCoach [ <PERSON>Bill ] O'Brien</PERSON> , " <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> said this week . 
" I could n't imagine having to deal with that , and keeping the guys loyal , keeping the guys wanting to come to the school . . . . He 's got a tough job . 
" That is the overriding sentiment as <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> prepares to face <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> onSaturday in <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Nittany Lions</ORGANIZATION> ' first road game since formerassistant coach <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky</PERSON> was convicted on 45 counts of child sex abuse andthe football program was hit with a four-year bowl ban and scholarshipreductions.It 's an important game for both teams . 
The Cavaliers hope to start the season2-0 with looming road games at <ORGANIZATION>Georgia Tech</ORGANIZATION> and TCU the next two weeks ; <ORGANIZATION>PennState</ORGANIZATION> is coming off a season-opening loss to Ohio.http : / / stats.washingtonpost.com/cfb/recap.asp?g=201209010034&e=2012_01_0034&home=34&vis=54&final=trueTheoff-field circumstances surrounding the <ORGANIZATION>Nittany Lions</ORGANIZATION> ' season ca n't be ignored.With <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> on the schedule this year , many <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> players paid closeattention to media reports on the scandal during the offseason . 
They 're tryingto treat the game like any other , with designs on defeating a brand-name foe innonconference play . 
But there 's empathy for the players who will line upopposite them at <LOCATION>Scott Stadium</LOCATION> . 
" It 's pretty honorable with what they 've done , " <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> defensive end <PERSON>JakeSnyder</PERSON> said . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> made it pretty obvious that they can get out and they cango to a different school and play with no hesitation , no problem , and those guysstuck by the school and the program that they love and that 's something that ' spretty awesome . 
" <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> believes playing the games represents the only " non-distraction " <ORGANIZATION>PennState</ORGANIZATION> enjoys these days . 
<PERSON>O'Brien</PERSON> , who is beginning his first season as thesuccessor to former coach <PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> , went one step further when he said thisweek , " There 's an element of that , just being able to get on a plane and go playat <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . 
" What reception the <ORGANIZATION>Nittany Lions</ORGANIZATION> receive will also be a point of intrigueSaturday . 
A near-sellout crowd is expected at <LOCATION>Scott Stadium</LOCATION> , and <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> ' splayers and coaches are expecting the worst despite the venue 's docilereputation in recent years . 
" We have said since Day One when all this stuff broke out that road games aregoing to be brutal for us , " <ORGANIZATION>Nittany Lions</ORGANIZATION> fullback <PERSON>Michael Zordich</PERSON> said.For <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , <DATE>Saturday</DATE> is the first real test of the year after a 43-19 victoryover <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> to open the season . 
Its young secondary will have to deal withO'Brien 's NFL-style offense and quarterback <PERSON>Michael Rocco</PERSON> might have to pass theCavaliers to a victory again if the <ORGANIZATION>Nittany Lions</ORGANIZATION> ' defense focuses on slowingdown <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's trio of tailbacks.But perhaps more important , the game will be on national television because ofall the attention being paid to <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> . 
And whether <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> is comfortablewith it or not , the <ORGANIZATION>Nittany Lions</ORGANIZATION> ' troubles could be a boon for <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> andcompany . 
" You just have to love the spotlight . 
We talk about it all the time . 
You have tolove the pressure in that situation , " tight end <PERSON>Paul Freedman</PERSON> said . 
" All theeyes are on you so it 's a great situation to show what you have .
