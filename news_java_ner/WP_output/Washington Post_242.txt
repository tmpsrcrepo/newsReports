Sens. <PERSON>Cory Booker</PERSON> ( D-N.J. ) and <PERSON>Mitch McConnell</PERSON> ( R-Ky . ) 
share at least onething.Campaign donors.Booker , a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> newbie , and <PERSON>McConnell</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> minority leader , show updipping into the same donor pool more than any other opposing-party members ofCongress . 
They shared 74 donors in the first year of this election cycle.This comes from a fascinating data dive from the Center for Responsive Politicsthat broke down which politicians have donor overlap . 
As the <ORGANIZATION>CRP</ORGANIZATION> points out , just shy of two-tenths of <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of American adults have donated to campaignsthis year , so the pickings are slim.Cashing checks makes strange bedfellows - a politician is n't going to care whoelse 's bed a donor has slept in ( figuratively , of course ) . 
Booker also shares donors with other top Republicans : <ORGANIZATION>House Majority LeaderEric Cantor</ORGANIZATION> ( <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> ) and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Minority Whip <PERSON>John Cornyn</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>Tex.</LOCATION> ) . 
And <PERSON>McConnell</PERSON> has donors in common with other Democrats , including Sens. <PERSON>MarkWarner</PERSON> ( Va. ) and <PERSON>Kay Hagan</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>N.C.</LOCATION> ) . 
Politicians from the same party , as you 'd expect , share donors at a higher rate.McConnell also tops that list , with 415 of his donors contributing to <PERSON>Cornyn</PERSON> aswell . 
Another obvious duo is <PERSON>Hagan</PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON>Jeanne Shaheen</PERSON> ( D-N.H . ) 
, who areboth running in high-profile , competitive reelection campaigns this year . 
Theyshare 387 donors.We were curious who these deep-pocketed party hoppers are . 
Our friends at theCRP dug up their data and shared the 74 names . 
They include <PERSON>Lawrence Salva</PERSON> , senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION>Comcast</ORGANIZATION> ; <PERSON>William Lauder</PERSON> , chairman of Est√©e Lauder ; and <PERSON>Eric Schmidt</PERSON> , executive chairman of Google.No sex , pleaseFictional vice president <PERSON>Selina Meyer</PERSON> was adamant on a recent episode of " Veep " : A female politician should not remind voters that she is , in fact , a woman . 
" No , no , no ! 
I ca n't identify myself as a woman - people ca n't know that , " <PERSON>Meyer</PERSON> toldher staff.With <PERSON>Meyer</PERSON> 's declaration still fresh , <PERSON>Terri Lynn Land</PERSON> , the presumptive GOPnominee for a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> , released a TV ad this weekresponding directly to charges that Republicans are waging a " war on women . 
" Doing exactly what <PERSON>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</PERSON> 's character had exasperatedly warnedagainst , Land tells voters , " As a woman , I might know a little bit more aboutwomen than <PERSON>Gary Peters</PERSON> [ her likely Democratic opponent ] . 
" Land is not the first , nor is she likely to be the last , female politician tohighlight her sex . 
Contrary to <PERSON>Meyer</PERSON> 's belief that drawing attention to yourgender is bad politics , real-life politicians have often employed the phrase " asa woman , " or some variation of it.Using the <ORGANIZATION>Sunlight Foundation</ORGANIZATION> 's Capitol Words tool , we found several instancesof female members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> playing up their gender during policy debates . 
Atleast two examples involved floor speeches on abortion - exactly the hot-buttonissue the <PERSON>Meyer</PERSON> team was mulling over when a staffer suggested that she use thephrase " as a woman " to explain her position.During debate in <DATE>January</DATE> over federal funding for abortion , Rep. <PERSON>Diane Black</PERSON> ( R-Tenn . ) 
said : " Now , despite the legislation 's bipartisan support , we have heard more than afew mischaracterizations of this bill from our colleagues across the aisle , andas a woman , I reject these false attacks . 
This legislation is not about takingaway anyone 's choice . 
It is about giving choice to the nearly two-thirds ofAmericans who do n't want their hard-earned tax dollars funding the destructionof innocent life . 
" In <DATE>July 2012</DATE> , Rep. <PERSON>Martha Roby</PERSON> ( R-Ala . ) 
said : " In sitting here listening to debate , I want to get a few things straight . 
Firstof all , I am a woman , and I have not declared war on myself . 
Second of all , thisis not a direct challenge to <PERSON>Roe v. Wade</PERSON> . 
This is a direct challenge tocruelty to unborn children . 
Currently , the policy in <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> legally allowsabortion for any reason until the moment of birth . 
" Abortion is n't the only issue that puts female politicians on the defensive . 
InApril , during a floor debate on equal pay for women , Sen. <PERSON>Kelly Ayotte</PERSON> ( R-N.H . ) 
said , " Frankly , as a woman , I would like the opportunity to outperformand to be paid more . 
" And in <DATE>June 2013</DATE> , during a debate about sexual assault in the military , Rep.Marsha Blackburn ( R-Tenn . ) 
said , " As a woman and as a strong supporter of ournation 's military , I find it absolutely appalling that any woman who has beenthe victim of crime should have to fear reporting her perpetrator for fear ofretaliation . 
" Of course , " Veep " fans know that at the end of the episode , <PERSON>Meyer</PERSON> contradictedherself . 
During an appearance on " Good Morning America , " she answered a questionabout abortion with " As a woman myself . . . " That 's Franklin , not - ghaziAt the risk of abusing an overused Washingtonism , we could observe thatSecretary of State <PERSON>John Kerry</PERSON> determined pretty early in his tenure at FoggyBottom that if you want a friend in this town , get a dog.Well , <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> 's best friend , <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> , affectionately known as " diplomutt " and namedfor <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON> , had quite the week in the spotlight . 
Kerry set up aTwitter account for his yellow Lab and tweeted his pup a happy-birthday messageTuesday . 
Almost instantly , <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> , without any tweets of his own , had more than 600followers . 
Then , on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> brought <PERSON>Ben</PERSON> to a ' Take Your Child to Work " event at <ORGANIZATION>theState Department</ORGANIZATION> . 
Ben behaved for most of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> top diplomat 's brief remarks , though he did jump on the female sign-language interpreter.The official <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> transcript from the event includes : " Whoops . 
Sit , sit , sit , sit . 
He 's learning . 
He 's one year old yesterday , two days ago . 
Whoops . 
( Laughter . ) 
Sit . 
He 's learning , slowly . 
He 's getting there . 
" Should <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> consider trying some of those obedience techniques on VladimirPutin ?
