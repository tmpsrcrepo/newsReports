In my nightmares , I see the women we have failed to protect from AIDS.Women in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> do almost everything . 
When they cook , they harvestspinach , carrots and cabbage from vegetable gardens they have plantedthemselves . 
When they clean , they use brooms made from dried grass they walkedmiles to harvest . 
They wash their entire family 's laundry by hand , wringing outclothes heavy with soapy water with hands that could break the neck of a chickenin one twist.The one thing women do n't do in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> , however , is tell their husbands touse condoms . 
When I taught AIDS awareness in a rural area near <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> , evenvirgin schoolboys posited that prophylactics were passe . 
" You ca n't eat a sweetin the wrapper , " they would say shyly in their broken English.In many cultures , men give " bride prices " ( labola ) and tacitly expect a maid , acook and a sexual servant . 
Women who request condoms are invariably consideredsuspect . 
Yet in <LOCATION>Zimbabwe</LOCATION> <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of women who have AIDS report being marriedand monogamous.Young women around the world need a prevention tool they can control , and sincethe late 1990s a small number of discerning researchers have explored onepossibility : an effective microbicide -- that is , a drug that women can applydirectly to their vaginas to reduce the spread of HIV . 
Antiretrovirals can holdback the tide of AIDS once a person is infected , but they 're costly and not atrue cure . 
HIV vaccines are years , possibly decades , away from widespreadrollout . 
Which brings us back to prevention.The " ABCs " of prevention are abstinence , being faithful and condom use . 
Butwe 've seen women slip through the cracks with these methods . 
Microbicides wouldbe a lifesaving safety net and could even theoretically prevent HIV transmissionafter rape if applied daily . 
Yet very few members of the general public -- indeed , very few health professionals -- know what they are . 
Why?In a world where vaccines are the rock stars of HIV prevention , microbicides arethe street musicians -- egalitarian , resourceful and poorly paid . 
TheInternational Partnership for Microbicides estimates that an annual <MONEY>$ 280 millioninvestment</MONEY> ( a fraction of the world budget for vaccine research ) for the nextfive years could generate an effective microbicide by <DATE>2010</DATE> . 
Yet microbicide researchers , typically nonprofits and academics , are strugglingon only <MONEY>$ 100 million</MONEY> a year . 
Certainly the microbicide world has suffered lossesin momentum from products that have failed to fulfill their promise.Additionally , potential microbicides are embarrassingly low-tech , with oneformulation being derived from seaweed and one from lime juice.But one gets the impression that pharmaceutical companies would be morepersistent in their efforts if the main beneficiaries of microbicides were notimpoverished African women -- women such as Grace , a quiet , God-fearinghousemaid I knew who worked seven days a week for three different families . 
Shefound out a month after her husband 's death that she had AIDS . 
Then there wasMimi . 
When her migrant worker husband abandoned her , she took up with a newboyfriend to support her three children . 
Until he died , after infecting her , shehad no idea that he had AIDS . 
I especially think about how microbicides couldsave women such as <PERSON>Joan</PERSON> , who became infected when she was raped at the age of 16by an assailant with AIDS . 
She 's one of the lucky ones , enrolled in a clinicaltrial of antiretrovirals in <LOCATION>Johannesburg</LOCATION> . 
But what if she , and the 50,000 yearlyrape victims in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> , had access to a microbicide they could put onbefore leaving the house or before a trip to a bar ? 
No telling how many livescould be saved . 
No telling until we have a microbicide in hand.As our administration funnels more and more AIDS funding to faith-basednongovernmental organizations , I despair for my sisters in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> , who know thatabstinence is rarely an option for the powerless and poor . 
Rather , it 's a luxuryfor those confident that they will eat tomorrow . 
A truly comprehensive andfarsighted global AIDS program would recognize that women need their own weaponsagainst HIV . 
They need microbicides.The writer , a physician at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford University Hospital and Clinics</ORGANIZATION> , has doneAIDS work in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> .
