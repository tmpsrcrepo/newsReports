After what allegedly happened to " Victim 2 , " a boy estimated to be 10 years old , in the same room where <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> football players shower , it 's near impossibleto keep reading the grand jury 's report . 
By " Victim 8 , " numbness turns to anger.You want to scream at the traumatized graduate assistant coach in <DATE>2002</DATE> andjanitor in <DATE>2000</DATE> who saw and did n't stop it , according to the report released bythe <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> attorney general 's office . 
You want to grab hold of and shakethose who reported the crime only to their superiors , washed their hands ofresponsibility and then let it go , treating a kid 's life as if it were afootball that slipped through their hands.Most of all , you want to have an audience with one of sports ' most endearingicons , <PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Happy Valley</ORGANIZATION> 's homespun saint , and ask <PERSON>Joe Pa</PERSON> , repeatedly , " While you were regaling everyone with sappy tales about meeting your wife 50years ago over ice cream at the local creamery in <LOCATION>State College</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION> , did youhave any idea what your longtime defensive coordinator was doing in the companyof young boys ? 
" If the <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> attorney general 's office is to be taken at its word - ifthe sad , sickening details of alleged sexual abuse of young boys by JerrySandusky are true - a once-immaculate program thought of as beyond reproach isnow close to beyond redemption.Paterno was n't charged , but if <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> is guilty , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> would be guilty - just as <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> 's athletic director and a university vice president , who werecharged with perjury and failure to report suspected child abuse on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> , would be guilty.They would all be party to a worse crime than any crooked , pay-for-play boosterat <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> or even SMU ever committed : guilty of protecting a programbefore a child.You ca n't read the 23-page grand jury report and come to any other conclusion ; <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> football and its pristine reputation apparently superseded thealleged sexual assault of a young boy - perhaps as many as eight young boys - over 15 years by <ORGANIZATION>Sandusky.Joe Pa</ORGANIZATION> knew , if the charges are true.They all knew.And they never told <ORGANIZATION>police.Penn State</ORGANIZATION> 's president and other university officials are standing behind TimCurley , the athletic director , and <PERSON>Gary Schultz</PERSON> , the senior vice president offinance and business . 
They maintained both men handled a <DATE>2002</DATE> complaint aboutSandusky properly - given what they knew of the situation at the time . 
" I wish to say that <PERSON>Tim Curley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gary Schultz</PERSON> have my unconditional support , " <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Graham Spanier</PERSON> said in a statement , which an athleticdepartment official said would be the school 's only comment on the matter . 
" Ihave known and worked daily with <PERSON>Tim</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gary</PERSON> for more than 16 years . 
I havecomplete confidence in how they have handled the allegations about a formerUniversity employee . 
" In the statement issued by <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> , the attorneys for <PERSON>Curley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Schultz</PERSON> saidtheir clients are not guilty . 
Sandusky 's attorney told a <LOCATION>Johnstown</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION> , television station that <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> " has maintained his innocence " after being awareof the allegations for more than three years.Sandusky , 67 , was charged , among other crimes , with seven counts of involuntarydeviate sexual intercourse , eight counts of corruption of minors , eight countsof endangering the welfare of a child and seven counts of indecent assault . 
Thegrand jury report says he met most of the boys through his <ORGANIZATION>Second Milefoundation</ORGANIZATION> , which helps at-risk children . 
He was arraigned and released on <MONEY>$ 100,000</MONEY> bail on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> . 
" I knew him the way I knew him ; he was always someone I admired , respected andlooked up to , " <PERSON>LaVar Arrington</PERSON> , who played for <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> in the <DATE>late 1990s</DATE> at theuniversity nicknamed " Linebacker U , " said by telephone <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> . 
" Hisfoundation has helped tons of kids . 
" But the former <ORGANIZATION>Redskins Pro Bowler</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> all-American linebacker , whois a contributor to washingtonpost.com , also added : " I 'm not declaring anything.I 'm neutral right now . " 
" Because I am also a father and because the thought of one of my kids cominghome and saying something bad happened to them like that , I ca n't even thinkabout it . 
I do n't want to discount the stories of the families and theirchildren . 
Innocent or guilty , he 's tarnished himself by this . 
I 'm verydisappointed it 's actually even a possibility . 
" According to the attorney general 's office , in <DATE>2002</DATE> a graduate student assistantwent to <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's home the day after he saw <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> sexually assaulting a boyin the shower late at night at <ORGANIZATION>Lasch Football Building</ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> campus.Paterno told <PERSON>Curley</PERSON> the next day.About 10 days after the incident , <PERSON>Curley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Schultz</PERSON> met with the graduateassistant who had witnessed the abuse . 
Their executive action , according to thegrand jury report : They told <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> that he could not bring any children fromhis foundation into the football building any more.No one from <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> - not <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> , not the human neckties , no one - everreported the alleged incident to law enforcement , which the grand jury reportsays is required under <ORGANIZATION>Pennsylvania lawIn Warped Sports World</ORGANIZATION> , the do n't - ask , do n't - tell , sweep-it-clean behavior isrationalized as loyalty , having your coach 's or teammate 's back , moving on fromthe problem . 
It 's seen as a noble quality , putting the team 's needs - theuniversity 's needs - before your own.Certainly it can be argued that <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> would have beenirrevocably hurt if these allegations had surfaced in a police report almost 10years ago ; a program whose legendary defensive coordinator was accused of beinga pedophile would lose recruits and , by association , money and prestige . 
Whowould n't want that to go away?But more unconscionable , if true : putting loyalty to the many , the program , infront of the victimization of even the one , a child.They were kids . 
Boys . 
Some no older than 8 years old when they were allegedlyabused by <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> between the years of <DATE>1994</DATE> and <DATE>2009</DATE> , are now in their 20s , scarred forever by an adult they trusted . 
One testified under oath he hid interror in <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> 's basement each time the coach came down the stairs.For those who observed or were told about possible sexual abuse , never tellinganyone beyond school officials is not merely an omission.And if the grand jury 's report is right , the man with the most victories in thehistory of big-time college football knew.Paterno and university officials knew they had n't employed a defensivecoordinator ; they had in effect empowered a sexual predator , who the report saysspent the next seven years molesting more boys.And because they possibly chose to protect <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> 's brand instead of a child - a 10-year-old kid whom they never even bothered to find out the name of , according to the grand jury report - more children might have suffered becauseof their silence.If the grand jury report is true , they all need to step down - even the greatJoe <LOCATION>Pa</LOCATION> . 
It 's the least he could do.For however long shame and guilt hover over his last days at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> it willnever outlast the shame and guilt felt by those young boys . 
Nor will it bringback their innocence . 
Like the sheen of <ORGANIZATION>Joe Pa</ORGANIZATION> 's program , that may well be goneforever.wisem@washpost.com
