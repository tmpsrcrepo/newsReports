Below is an excerpt from " On Faith , " a daily online religion section sponsoredby <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> . 
Each week , <PERSON>Jon Meacham</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sally Quinnengage</PERSON> figures from the world of faith in a conversation about an aspect ofreligion . 
This week , On Faith asked : Should Pope <PERSON>Benedict XVI</PERSON> be heldresponsible for the escalating scandals over clerical sexual abuse in Europe?Should he be investigated for cases of abuse that occurred under his watch asarchbishop of <LOCATION>Munich</LOCATION> or as the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> 's chief doctrinal enforcer ? 
Should thepope resign?Anti - Catholic bias : The question of whether Pope <PERSON>Benedict XVI</PERSON> should resign is , frankly , silly , because it assumes guilt where none has been proven or evencredibly asserted . . . . The charge that <PERSON>Ratzinger</PERSON> , when archbishop of <LOCATION>Munich</LOCATION> , knowingly reassigned a dangerous predator to pastoral ministry has been flatlydenied by both the archdiocese and the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> . 
Anyone who knows the elementaryfacts of the history of the Holy See 's handling of these cases over the lastdecade knows that <PERSON>Ratzinger</PERSON> was at the forefront of efforts to bring abusers tobook , swiftly and decisively , and his recent letter to the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> inIreland demonstrates beyond cavil that he is determined to continue thoseefforts , wherever they lead.George <PERSON>Weigel</PERSON> , Catholic theologian and authorOrdination does not equal immunity from prosecution : Of course he should be heldaccountable . 
He approved moving Cardinal <PERSON>Bernard Law</PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> to keep himfrom having to answer questions under oath . . . . Child abuse is a crime . 
Covering up a crime is also a crime . 
Ordination and aposition in the Roman Catholic hierarchy does not make one immune to theconsequences of criminal behavior.John <PERSON>Shelby Spong</PERSON> , former bishop , <ORGANIZATION>Episcopal Diocese of NewarkEveryday</ORGANIZATION> believers vs. institutional scandal : The pope ought to act himself andact fast to end this by acknowledging the mistakes made and stepping away fromhis post . 
When he does , the relief for victims , their loved ones and the mostlyignored , and almost completely unaffected everyday Catholics living joyfullytoday will breathe easily and move on with their lives and their faith , as <PERSON>theyshould.Mark Tauber</PERSON> , senior vice president , <ORGANIZATION>HarperCollins PublishersTime</ORGANIZATION> for an apology and amends : If the pope recognizes that mistakes were made , he should make apologies and amends . 
If he recognizes that he was the one whomade the mistakes , he should similarly clear the air and , using his best Latin , cry " mea culpa . " 
People are far more willing to forgive when honest admissionsof culpability are made than when one comes clean only after a coverup has beenexposed to the light of day.Max <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> , director , <ORGANIZATION>Friends Center</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Guilford CollegeHeaven</ORGANIZATION> is the presence of Christ : No , Pope <PERSON>Ratzinger</PERSON> should not resign . 
Heshould remain in charge of the whole rotten edifice -- the whole profiteering,woman-fearing , guilt-gorging , truth-hating , child-raping institution -- while ittumbles , amid a stench of incense and a rain of tourist-kitsch sacred hearts andpreposterously crowned virgins , about his ears.Richard <PERSON>Dawkins</PERSON> , British evolutionary biologist , authorDo we expect the pope to do a perp walk ? 
From my limited vantage point , itappears this pope is trying to work through a problem that was not adequatelyaddressed by previous regimes . 
In as large an organization as the Roman CatholicChurch , with its dense network of power relationships , I ca n't imagine that 's aneasy task . 
I 'm generally disinclined to tell other ecclesiastical bodies how tomanage their internal affairs , but if I were n't so polite and reticent , I stillwould n't tell the pope to resign.Jason <PERSON>Poling</PERSON> , founding pastor , <ORGANIZATION>New Hope Community</ORGANIZATION> ChurchBenedict should stay and clean house : Should Catholics be angry about theongoing revelations of clergy sexual abuse ? 
Absolutely . 
Do victims deserve afull accounting of how those cases were handled ? 
Yes again . 
Should Benedictresign ? 
No . 
He should do what a good father would do : root out the filth in hishouse , acknowledge the church 's past failings frankly and let his flock know , inboth word and action , that he shares their fury at these unspeakable crimes andtheir resolve that they never be repeated.Colleen <PERSON>Carroll Campbell</PERSON> , columnist , tv/radio show host for Eternal WorldTelevision NetworkA resignation would be mind-boggling but soul-healing : So though the thought ofthe pope resigning still boggles my mind , what a powerful statement it would beto all Catholics and people everywhere ! 
Perhaps the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> would notcrumble but instead emerge as a stronger tradition . 
Embattled yes , but embattledin the service of being a force for good , and no longer for enabling criminalbehavior.Donna Freitas , assistant professor of religion , <ORGANIZATION>Boston University</ORGANIZATION>
