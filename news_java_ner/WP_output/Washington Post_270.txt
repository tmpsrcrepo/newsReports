Are you feeling nostalgic about the beginning of the end of the BowlChampionship Series ? 
Me neither.Replacing the BCS with a four-team playoff next season will not erase all thatis wrong with college football . 
But the start of the actual season helps to dullthe annoyances brought on by the usual offseason scandals , from the very serious ( sexual assault cases involving players at <ORGANIZATION>Vanderbilt</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> ) to the lessserious ( <PERSON>Johnny Manziel</PERSON> 's offseason antics and personal fundraising activities ) to the ridiculous ( <ORGANIZATION>Oregon</ORGANIZATION> 's champagne-wishes-and-caviar-dreams locker room ) . 
The start of the season also is a chance to dig out our college footballconference map and to try re-remember which team belongs to which conferencebefore conference play begins . 
For instance , <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse</ORGANIZATION> are in theACC . 
There is also a new conference , the <ORGANIZATION>American Athletic Conference</ORGANIZATION> . 
Yes , that 's right , the <ORGANIZATION>AAC</ORGANIZATION> . 
This season , <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> and Rutgers probably will be thebest teams in the <ORGANIZATION>AAC</ORGANIZATION> . 
Next season , <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rutgers</ORGANIZATION> will no longer be thebest teams in the <ORGANIZATION>AAC</ORGANIZATION> because <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> is moving to the <ORGANIZATION>ACC</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rutgers</ORGANIZATION> to theBig Ten . 
Seriously.But enough of that . 
The season officially kicks off <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> with a prettygood game : <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> at No. 6 <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> . 
The Gamecocks have one of thebest players in the country , defensive end <PERSON>Jadeveon Clowney</PERSON> . 
When you interviewClowney , does he say , " That 's a Clowney question , bro " ? 
Probably not . 
Too bad.Instead , the highlight this week on " SportsCenter " will be all the interviewswith <PERSON>Steve Spurrier</PERSON> while he 's sitting in a golf cart . 
It 's as timeless andfamiliar as the swallows returning to <PERSON>Capistrano</PERSON> - in a golf cart.Saturday 's lineup includes No. 1 <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> , whose pursuit of a record threetitles in a row begins in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> against <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> . 
A third title - justwhat the Tide needs , because otherwise how will <PERSON>Nick Saban</PERSON> get anyone to playfor him ? 
In college football , this is the definition of the rich getting richer - I 'm not talking about <PERSON>Manziel</PERSON> now - which is why schools such as <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> canstay on top.That 's also the reason the playing field ( no pun intended ) is so uneven , and whyschools such as <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> jump to conferences like the <ORGANIZATION>Big Ten</ORGANIZATION> . 
It 's the money , honey . 
That 's why the preseason top 25 looks like a rundown of the top programsof the past 20 years - plus Northwestern and minus <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State</ORGANIZATION> . 
And that ' swhy the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> has a pretty good chance of extending its national title streak toeight.Still , even with college football 's predictability , this is a great weekend . 
" College GameDay " returns , but it 's still a great weekend . 
This is the weekend , for example , that a young quarterback can lead his team to a 50-48 victory in agame so anticipated it was played on a <DATE>Friday</DATE> , not normally a hot spot on theschedule . 
But it was also played on <ORGANIZATION>ESPN</ORGANIZATION> , and that made all the difference forBaylor and <ORGANIZATION>TCU</ORGANIZATION> two years ago . 
A lot of people started their holiday weekend bystaying up to watch the shootout , and <PERSON>Robert Griffin III</PERSON> became a national name.Even if your alma mater is not good , you root for it this <DATE>weekend</DATE> . 
You beginrooting against your mortal enemies this <DATE>weekend</DATE> . 
If you 're a Wahoo , you preparefor BYU ; if you 're a Terp , you get <ORGANIZATION>Florida International</ORGANIZATION> , a program in disarrayand a school that 's also in a new conference : Conference USA.And all that love and all that hate translates to the national scene . 
You startrooting for or against <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> to three-peat , depending on your allegiance . 
Youlook forward to national games such as Nebraska-Michigan or Notre Dame vs.Michigan , or <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State</ORGANIZATION> , or <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> , or <ORGANIZATION>USC</ORGANIZATION> , or <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> . 
( This is theanswer to the question : Why does <ORGANIZATION>Notre Dame</ORGANIZATION> have its own TV deal ? ) 
The point is , this is when college football loses that rotting meat smell andbecomes fun and interesting . 
Enjoy it , because sadly , there will be anotheroffseason in 2014.tracee.hamilton@washpost.comFor more by <PERSON>Tracee Hamilton</PERSON> , visit washingtonpost.com/hamilton .
