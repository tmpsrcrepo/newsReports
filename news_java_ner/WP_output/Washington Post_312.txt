Choir rehearsal was supposed to end at <TIME>5 p.m.</TIME> , but <PERSON>Patrick Lundy</PERSON> is stillplowing ahead at 10 minutes past the hour . 
The director of the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern HighSchool Choir</ORGANIZATION> seems oblivious to the time and the exigencies tugging at his youngsingers on this <DATE>September</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> : One girl has to catch a bus for nightschool ; another is supposed to baby-sit her sister ; a third needs to get to anafter-school job at Best Buy.Don ' t do that , <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> warns when he catches someone eyeing the clock . 
He placeshis hands on the electric piano and , once again , makes the singers repeat astring of lofty notes from " The Battle Hymn of the Republic . " 
They 've beenrehearsing this section of the song for 30 minutes . 
" It sounds like your house is sinking , " he tells the altos , where one girl issinging as flat as Kansas.Facing them , <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> rolls up his shirtsleeves . 
If they sing this right , theBattle Hymn should be able to lift an audience right out of its seats . 
He wo n'tbe satisfied until it does.This dogged demand for excellence has been the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern High School Choir</ORGANIZATION> ' shallmark for more than three decades . 
It 's how <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> and his predecessor , JoyceGarrett , built the ensemble into one of the <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> public school system 's mostrenowned cultural institutions . 
It 's how the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern High School Choir</ORGANIZATION> has cometo perform for every president since <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> , to make frequent appearancesat the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Center</ORGANIZATION> and on national television , to back up <PERSON>Aretha Franklin</PERSON> , <PERSON>Christina Aguilera</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stevie Wonder</PERSON> , and to bring in hundreds of thousands ofdollars for college scholarships along the way.But as the new school year gets underway at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> , those glories are only adistant memory . 
The choir -- and the school that houses it -- is struggling . 
" Sit at the edge of your chairs , " <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> commands . 
" Do n't slouch . . . I want itto sound like this . " 
He strikes a note on the keyboard and belts out the elusivepart . 
His hands sweep back and forth like a broom , showing the rhythm he wants . 
" You can go home when it 's perfect , " <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> tells his singers.Loretta <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> listens from the second row of the alto section . 
Some of theother girls chatter when <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> looks elsewhere . 
Loretta , however , remains quiet , with her hands folded in her lap and her spine as rigid as a rod . 
The16-year-old junior does n't care what time rehearsal ends . 
Let it last all night.Few things make her as happy as being in the choir.Well , maybe being accepted at <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ORGANIZATION> . 
That wouldmake her happy , too . 
Neither of <LOCATION>Loretta</LOCATION> 's parents went to college , but shethinks she might want to be an engineer . 
Her grades would seem to support suchan ambition . 
She 's a top student at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> , with nearly all A 's . 
But success inthis building does n't always hold up in the broader world.Abruptly , <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> halts the rehearsal . 
Listen , he says . 
The year 's firstperformance , a show for <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> 's student body , is just three days away . 
If youall are really knockouts up there , <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> says , then more students will want tojoin the choir.Despite its prestige and its scholarship money , the choir is in desperate needof bodies . 
The rehearsal room sits two-thirds empty , with stacks of unusedchairs in the back . 
By <DATE>October</DATE> , <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> hopes to have 75 to 100 singers . 
Rightnow , that seems like fantasy . 
Last week there were about 45 singers . 
Today thereare 36 . 
Lundy finishes his recruitment spiel and returns to hammering home " The BattleHymn of the Republic . " 
It 's almost 5:30 . 
Suddenly , a soprano stands up . 
" Whereare you going ? " 
asks another soprano . 
" I quit , " announces the first girl , who grabs her things and walks out . 
Nobodyelse pays her any attention , not even <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> . 
Rehearsal carries on as if thishappens all the time.BUILT IN <DATE>1923</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>Eastern High School</ORGANIZATION> stands about one mile from the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Capitoland looks like a red brick castle , its two soaring spires capped with parapets.The windows are all new , and visitors discover a grand marble staircase justinside the front door.Beyond that staircase , however , <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> sheds any pretense of grandeur . 
Thelighting is poor . 
The walls are painted and patched in discordant shades ofoff-white . 
The doors to classrooms are made of heavy , windowless steel.Mysterious holes open in hallway ceilings.At the beginning of the school year , then-Superintendent <PERSON>Paul Vance</PERSON> announcedthat <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> , along with <LOCATION>Anacostia</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Woodson</PERSON> , were the District high schoolsmost in need of " transformation . " 
It 's easy to understand why <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> made thelist . 
The school 's students performed abysmally on last year 's Stanford 9standardized tests . 
Almost <PERCENT>82 percent</PERCENT> of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> students scored " below basic " in math ; nearly <PERCENT>56 percent</PERCENT> scored " below basic " in reading ; and no studentscored " advanced " in either category . 
Eastern , the school system declared , needed to " undergo reform at an aggressive , accelerated pace . 
" None of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> 's problems are new . 
In <DATE>1978</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> ran a series offront-page articles about <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> , describing burned-out teachers , nearlyilliterate seniors , rampant absenteeism and dope smokers roaming the hallsinstead of attending class.Joyce <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> , who became a music teacher at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1972</DATE> , remembers that eradifferently . 
The school may have had its academic troubles , but it also had asense of purpose , she says . 
" There were award-winning football teams , championship basketball teams and every kind of organization you can imagine , " she recalls . 
" When there were basketball games , the gym would be packed . 
Theteachers , we all went to the games . 
It was just a totally involved community , the school was back then . " 
She acknowledges that she may have been wearingrose-colored glasses . 
" I do n't know whether I thought it was so wonderfulbecause I was just twentysomething and glad to be there , but I did think it wasreally special . 
" <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> founded the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern High School Choir</ORGANIZATION> soon after arriving and pouredherself into the lives of her singers . 
Many came from poor homes and faced " somany challenges in their lives , from drugs , from sexual abuse . 
I heard everystory that anybody could tell anybody , " she remembers . 
Parents in jail . 
Studentsliving in homeless shelters . 
Smart kids dropping out . 
" I became the teacher , thecounselor , somebody 's mother . . . And it 's not like you want to do this all thetime . 
But you 're called to do it . 
You have to do it . 
If somebody comes to youand says , ' Somebody stole my coat . ' 
And it 's 20 degrees outside , then somebodyneeds to get them a coat . 
So , you just go on and get them the coat . 
" The choir reached its musical apogee in <DATE>1988</DATE> , when <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> and her singersraised <MONEY>$ 160,000</MONEY> to compete in the <ORGANIZATION>International Youth and Music Festival</ORGANIZATION> inVienna , <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION> . 
" I wanted them to perform on the highest possible level . 
Iwanted them to be world class , " <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> says.They were . 
After the choir placed first in the high school competition , it wasfeatured in People magazine and on the front page of The Post . 
There was asegment on " CBS <DATE>Sunday</DATE> Morning . " 
Reagan invited the singers to the White House.But the choir 's success in <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION> also led to an unsettling realization . 
Onlythree of the 20 seniors who competed there went on to college . 
Garrett realizedthat her students were , at once , musical superstars and academic nobodies.That 's when <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> developed a program called " Excellence Without Excuses . " 
Thechoir would no longer be just about spawning great voices . 
It would be a vehiclefor teaching values . 
Chief among those values : college.Kaleen <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> , who joined the choir in <DATE>1989</DATE> as a sophomore , says singing forJoyce <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> changed his life . 
No one in his family had gone to college . 
No oneventured much beyond their <LOCATION>Southeast Washington</LOCATION> neighborhood . 
The choirbroadened <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> 's horizons and enabled him to envision a different future forhimself . 
He sang in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> , in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> , in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> . 
" We traveled to a lotof places , met a lot of people that I would n't have met , " says <PERSON>Cooper</PERSON> , now 29 , who graduated from <ORGANIZATION>North Carolina A&T State University</ORGANIZATION> with a marketing degreeand received an MBA and a master 's in international affairs from <ORGANIZATION>OhioUniversity</ORGANIZATION> . 
As a graduate student , he worked in <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Swaziland</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>SouthAfrica</ORGANIZATION> . 
Today he works for a financial services company and lives with his wifeand two children in Northern Virginia.By the mid - <DATE>'90s</DATE> , most of the choir 's singers were heading for universities : <LOCATION>George Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Depauw</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Hampton</LOCATION> . 
A few even made it to <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> . 
At theend of every year , the choir 's performance revenue is split among thecollege-bound seniors . 
Four-year members of the choir are eligible for at least <MONEY>$ 4,000</MONEY> . 
Three-year members can earn <MONEY>$ 3,000</MONEY> . 
Two-year members are eligible for <MONEY>$ 2,000</MONEY> . 
Last year , 18 or 19 seniors went on to college , taking <MONEY>$ 46,000</MONEY> inscholarship money with them . 
Many seniors also receive additional scholarshipmoney from the colleges that recruit them to sing in their choirs.In <DATE>1995</DATE> , <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> formalized the choir 's fundraising apparatus by starting anonprofit called the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Choral Society</ORGANIZATION> . 
That allowed the choir to tapfoundation and corporate donors . 
( The Post has been a frequent patron . 
The Postalso supports a general scholarship program at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> . ) 
But the choir 's successdid n't seem to have much of an impact on the rest of the school . 
Eastern stillcalled itself " The Pride of Capitol Hill , " but <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> was finding it tougher toteach there . 
" Students were becoming so hostile , " says <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> , who retired fromteaching in <DATE>1999</DATE> . 
" After school , the choir was coming along fine , but I had tobe there all through the battles during the day . 
And I was n't enjoying it . 
" While she continued to direct the choir full time , she began looking for aworthy successor.She eventually turned the reins over to <PERSON>Patrick Lundy</PERSON> , a former high schoolmusic teacher and a respected composer and director of adult choirs . 
Lundydescribes himself as the product of a happy , two-parent childhood inThomasville , <LOCATION>Ga</LOCATION> . 
His mother bought him his first keyboard when he was only 2 . 
<PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> knew that many of <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> 's students did n't have the same advantages . 
Hesays he wanted to " give back . 
" But <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> lasted just two years as a music teacher at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> , calling what hefound there " a rude awakening . " 
In an ideal high school , he says , " there arerules and regulations that we all must abide by . 
Simple things like , you must bein class and not walk the halls . 
I had kids just skip class , come into classlate . 
Most high schools have books and materials available . 
We would spend ourown dollars , copy our own materials outside the building , because the copiermachine was not working . . . Some of those things were frustrating . 
" <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> decided to resume full-time work with his church and adult choirs . 
Now hecomes to <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> only after classes to rehearse the choir.Because <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> does n't teach at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> anymore , he ca n't prowl the hallways , looking for singers , as <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> used to do . 
He acknowledges that he does n't knowhis singers as well as he once did . 
" When I was there , the kids would comeduring lunchtime and really talk about whatever , " <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> says . 
It was easier tokeep track of who had made the honor roll or whose family had just been evicted . 
" That connection is lost , and we are suffering because of it , " <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> says.It is increasingly difficult to recruit enough singers . 
A shrinking talent poolis part of the problem . 
When the choir was founded in <DATE>1972</DATE> , more than 2,000 students attended <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> . 
This year enrollment has dropped to just over 900 . 
Fewer kids at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> means fewer voices in the choir.Apathy also plays a part . 
" Most of the students at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> do n't do nothing , " laments <PERSON>Onteia Cohen</PERSON> , a senior who serves as the choir 's vice president and hassung with the group for four years . 
" They sit home and watch TV on the couch andeat . " 
Boys , she says , are especially difficult to attract , because they oftenbecome targets of derision by classmates.Senior <PERSON>Cofield Williams</PERSON> , the choir 's president and one of its few basses , suggests only half-jokingly that the choir would attract more males if itsrecruitment posters pictured the " breasts and behinds " of the female singersinstead of its current approach : " Sing Your Way to College . 
" The board overseeing the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Choral Society</ORGANIZATION> has been pondering the choir ' sfuture . 
Maybe it 's time to part ways with <ORGANIZATION>Eastern High School</ORGANIZATION> , says <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> , whosits on the board : " We 're wondering if we should make this a citywide program , that anyone from the city can come and sing in the choir , get our benefits andthe scholarships . . . We are at a turning point . 
We have to do somethingdifferent . 
" LUNDY LEADS THE CHOIR into an unruly auditorium for the first performance of theyear . 
Only a few students are responsible for the ruckus , but it does n't takemany to poison the atmosphere . 
As the choir moves down a side aisle , a boy inthe audience jeers at one of the tenors , saying loudly , " Look at that faggot . 
" Principal <PERSON>Norman Smith</PERSON> takes the microphone to deliver a short , pointed lectureon proper conduct in the auditorium . 
At 55 , <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> stands well over 6 feet tall , with a chest like a bookcase , a balding head and a grizzled beard . 
By dint ofsize alone , <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> projects a quality desirable in high school principals : presence.Eastern <ORGANIZATION>High School</ORGANIZATION> has been burning through a lot of administrators -- fiveprincipals in the past six years . 
Several were forced out . 
Smith has been on thejob for a little more than a month . 
He had retired from the <LOCATION>Baltimore Countypublic</LOCATION> school system after a six-year stint as principal at <ORGANIZATION>Milford MillAcademy</ORGANIZATION> . 
Then last <DATE>summer</DATE> a <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> schools official called to offer <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> the helmat <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> . 
The salary : <MONEY>$ 113,134</MONEY> . 
The commute : 1 hour 10 minutes . 
Theopportunity : " To try to make a difference , " <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> says.Already , <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> has cracked down on <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> 's chronic class-cutters . 
During theschool day , <ORGANIZATION>Smith</ORGANIZATION> 's voice will crackle across the <ORGANIZATION>PA</ORGANIZATION> system to announce : " Thisis a clean sweep . 
Teachers close and lock your doors . " 
Then the security guardsround up any students caught in the hallway . 
They are herded into theauditorium , where detention slips are issued.The word among teachers is that <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> 's experienced approach might finally bringstability to the building . 
" The kids primarily ran this place last year , " sayshistory teacher <PERSON>Frederick Quick</PERSON> , who finds <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> " very supportive . 
" Some students dutifully listen to <ORGANIZATION>Smith</ORGANIZATION> 's lecture on auditorium etiquette -- butmostly those who were behaving to begin with.Backstage , the choir is preparing to perform before its first audience of theyear . 
It 's the home crowd , and no doubt the toughest the singers will face allyear . 
" I 'm scared y' all , " <PERSON>Loretta Miller says.Patrick Lundy</PERSON> steps onstage first , taking his place behind the piano , his backto the audience . 
The singers follow , filing onto a bank of risers . 
They wearbluejeans , a bouquet of solid-colored T-shirts and forced smiles . 
A weakapplause greets their entrance.Lundy strikes a note , and soft voices project into the auditorium , like lightpenetrating a darkroom through a keyhole : Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the LordHe is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored , He has loosed the fateful lightening of His terrible swift swordHis truth is marching on.Glory ! 
Glory ! 
HallelujahThere is drama in the faces and bodies of the singers , projecting both gravityand elation . 
When they sing , " The truth is marching , " <PERSON>Cofield</PERSON> , the burly bass , rolls back his shoulders , inflates his chest and rocks his arms like a fieldmarshal.But the sound system does n't do justice to the music . 
Lundy 's piano is too loud.The risers are set too deep in the stage . 
It 's impossible to appreciate , visually or acoustically , the richness of the show . 
" I do n't want to hear that [ expletive ] no more , " says a student in the audience.Another never looks up from her homework.When the choir finishes , though , a quartet of girls , front and center , stand andapplaud . 
" Lorrretaaa , " one shrill voice calls out lovingly.LORETTA NEEDS TO REPEAT the name of her first-period class . 
" Did you say worldculture ? " 
I ask . 
" No , floral culture , " she corrects . 
Loretta shoves her textbooks into a locker , keeping a plastic grocery bag that is filled with green plastic grass . 
Loretta , a conservative dresser , wears bluejeans and a loose fitting T-shirt . 
That 's notto say she does n't sometimes bow to peer pressure when it comes to appearance.She stopped wearing her eyeglasses , she says , because " people kept telling me Ilooked studious . " 
Now she settles for squinting at the chalkboard.This is <LOCATION>Loretta</LOCATION> 's first year at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> . 
She transferred here from <ORGANIZATION>H.D. WoodsonHigh School</ORGANIZATION> , where she 'd also been a choir member . 
" There was tone-deaf peoplein that choir . 
It would make the choir sound bad . 
[ The director ] had me singingsoprano , " says <PERSON>Loretta</PERSON> , an alto . 
She knew she 'd find something better atEastern.Back in middle school , she 'd heard the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> choir perform . 
She was blownaway . 
" They sounded just like the radio , " she remembers . 
So one afternoon , inthe winter of her sophomore year at <LOCATION>Woodson</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Loretta</PERSON> made her way to Eastern.She stood outside the rehearsal room and placed her ear to the door . 
" I wasscared because my cousin , " an <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> alumnus , " said you got to be on your P'sand Q 's to be in the choir . " 
A reference to <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> 's no-nonsense discipline andHimalayan demands.Loretta stepped through the door and asked if she could join . 
She 'd have tocatch a bus and a train to make the trip across town . 
She might not be right ontime for practice . 
Was that okay?Yes , it was . 
Lundy installed <PERSON>Loretta</PERSON> in the alto section and also invited her tojoin the select choir -- the choir 's varsity team . 
The choir immediately feltlike home , <PERSON>Loretta</PERSON> says . 
Over the <DATE>summer</DATE> , she decided to transfer to Eastern.Loretta 's mother , <PERSON>Virginia Miller</PERSON> , was fine with her daughter 's decision.Miller , a 37-year-old administrative assistant at <ORGANIZATION>Children 's Hospital</ORGANIZATION> , says aslong as <LOCATION>Loretta</LOCATION> is doing well in school , she does n't try to influence herdaughter 's education . 
<PERSON>Virginia Miller</PERSON> graduated from <ORGANIZATION>Anacostia High School</ORGANIZATION> butdid n't consider college . 
She was already a mother by then.Loretta 's older brother , <PERSON>Nate</PERSON> , is a 20-year-old sophomore at <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> StateUniversity . 
The rest of the family -- <PERSON>Loretta</PERSON> , her mother , stepfather andtoddler sister -- live in <LOCATION>Northeast Washington</LOCATION> , on a block of modestsingle-family homes with bars in the windows and rosebushes in the front yards.Loretta 's mother supports her daughter 's ambition to become an engineer , thoughshe chuckles when she talks about it . 
Loretta is prone to changing her mind , shesays , " but I do n't tell her that . 
" Loretta picked up the engineering idea last year after joining Leaders ofTomorrow , a mentoring program sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>National Black MBA</ORGANIZATION> Association.During one meeting , she spoke with a computer engineer and said to herself , <ORGANIZATION>Ican</ORGANIZATION> do that.Loretta does n't have to look far to find the source of her ambitious nature : " Ithink it 's me mainly . . . I see what I like to do , and that 's what I do . 
" Now a purple basket sits in front of <LOCATION>Loretta</LOCATION> . 
She made the basket by soakingyarn in glue and wrapping the yarn around a balloon . 
When the glue dried , shepopped the balloon as the yarn kept its shape . 
Voilà , a basket.Today the assignment is to cut an opening in the basket and fill it with thegreen plastic grass that <LOCATION>Loretta</LOCATION> <TIME>bought this morning</TIME> . 
Then she 's to decorate itwith lacy white ribbon and , finally , place chocolates in the grass.Loretta did n't especially want to take floral culture , the kind of class theschool system vowed to eliminate at the beginning of the school year as part ofEastern 's transformation . 
" Challenges in Daily Living " disappeared in the driveto inject more rigor into the curriculum ; floral culture did not . 
Loretta saysit was the only elective available when she transferred . 
She knows the classis n't going to help her get into <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> . 
She recently applied to the university ' sprestigious <DATE>summer</DATE> program for high school students that targets minorities . 
ButLoretta is pessimistic about getting in . 
Though her <ORGANIZATION>GPA</ORGANIZATION> is nearly perfect , shescored just 850 out of <DATE>1600</DATE> on the SAT . 
That puts her above the District averageand higher than most of her peers at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> . 
But <DATE>last year</DATE> the mean SAT scoreof students accepted into the <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> summer program was <DATE>1290</DATE> . 
Loretta 's high school classes have n't prepared her all that well for the SAT.Most classes at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Loretta</PERSON> complains , do n't make you think . 
" There 's a lotof memorization . " 
Worksheets are a common teaching tool.Loretta makes an exception for Algebra II , which she finds challenging . 
One dayin class , <PERSON>Nathaniel Ogunniyi</PERSON> , the math teacher , writes on the chalkboard to showhis students how to find the inverse of a function . 
Most of the kids watchintently and scribble along , but a few talk loudly among themselves . 
Lorettalooks up impatiently from her notebook . 
" Can y' all be quiet . 
Mr. <PERSON>Ogunniyi</PERSON> tryi n'to show us something . 
" Loretta struggles against the mental dry rot , carrying <PERSON>James Baldwin</PERSON> 's Go TellIt on the Mountain from class to class . 
She chose the classic story of a Harlemteenager 's spiritual awakening for a book report for English . 
At first , <PERSON>Lorettafound Baldwin</PERSON> 's prose difficult to follow . 
Now , almost finished , she 's hooked.She 's holding <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> when she walks into a dank basement classroom . 
This ischemistry . 
She looks at the chalkboard and says the questions have been up therefor two weeks . 
Lately , chemistry has been her least favorite class . 
The teacherhas been sick for several weeks , and the substitute , himself a graduate ofEastern High School , does n't demand much . 
There 's not even the pretend learningthat characterizes too many courses at Eastern : no word searches , no definitionscopied from a textbook glossary , no test-taking skills.Today the substitute hands back some tests covering material that <PERSON>Loretta</PERSON> saysshe was tested on earlier in the year . 
Loretta looks at her paper : One hundredpercent . 
Nothing else seems to be in the plan book . 
Loretta opens her algebrabook . 
Earlier in the day , <PERSON>Ogunniyi</PERSON> announced an upcoming test . 
If nothing else , chemistry class serves as a study hall.Doing little more than running her mouth , a girl at the back of the class sooncalls out : " These walls about to fall in on us " and utters a curse . 
The outburstperturbs the substitute , who is sitting at his desk watching a movie on aportable DVD player . 
He politely asks the girl not to curse . 
Not five secondslater , the f-word projects from his <ORGANIZATION>DVD</ORGANIZATION> player . 
" You sitting there , and your DVD cursing , " the girl says.A little later , the principal opens the door . 
With a drawn expression , Smithsurveys the lack of activity in the classroom . 
He leaves , returns to have a wordwith the substitute , then calls me into the hallway . 
" What 's going on in there ? " 
he asks . 
" Nothing , " I say . 
" The teacher 's watching a DVD . 
The kids are talking . 
Loretta ' sdoing math . 
" After sending me back into the classroom , <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> once again asks to speak withthe substitute . 
When the substitute returns to the classroom , he turns off theDVD player and asks the students to turn to Chapter 6 in their chemistry book.Loretta looks up from her algebra . 
" We just now did that chapter , " she says.JESUS SAVE me , Sanctify me , Wash me in the cleansingBlood of the Lamb.It 's gospel day for the choir , and a blast of faith reverberates through thethird-floor rehearsal room.The choir is up to six basses , though one of them is practically tone deaf , andanother one barely parts his lips when singing . 
The tenors are hovering at aboutnine . 
The uptick in male singers seemed to follow a pizza party where young menin the hallways were welcomed in for a slice . 
One of the pizza-party recruitsbriefly attended rehearsals . 
He soon left the choir , however , because his job atMcDonald 's got in the way . 
The boy who was jeered at during the assembly has n'tbeen around much.All of that is forgotten on gospel day . 
Most of these kids have been singinggospel in neighborhood churches since they could see over a pew . 
So come gospelday , it 's as if the glass slipper suddenly fits . 
The choir does n't always seemas comfortable with the rest of its repertoire , which ranges from Beethoven toEllington . 
One song is sung in <LOCATION>Latin</LOCATION> ; even those in English require rigidposture and sharp vocal control.But gospel music means a homecoming . 
Lundy 's arms and face dance as he conductsto music provided by a four-piece band . 
The joyous sound rolls through thecorridors of the school , attracting an impromptu audience . 
Students , teachersand custodians gather by the door to listen.The kids ' vowels are long , loose and tweaked-out . 
Their explosive voices emitfrom somewhere deep and more ancient than themselves . 
As they sing , the choirsways like a bed of sea anemones in an inexorable ocean of rhythm.ONE AFTERNOON <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> ca n't make it to rehearsal , so <PERSON>Joyce Garrett</PERSON> fills in . 
" Let 's learn a spiritual right quick , " <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> says to the students . 
She laysher hands on the keyboard and begins teaching . 
The basses in particular respondto her sharp directions.The students giggle at her range . 
She can sing , with equal facility , the part ofthe basses or the sopranos.But from within the soprano section , <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> finds small , insidious lapses . 
Onesoprano sits mute ; in 45 minutes she has n't uttered a single note . 
Anotherstands up to get her purse and removes a case of lip gloss , which she applieswhile <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> is speaking . 
The lip gloss is passed back to another girl . 
Afourth soprano mutters " shut up " when the section is exhorted to work harder , though only her immediate neighbors hear the insult.Such behavior may be common elsewhere at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> , but in this room , for JoyceGarrett , it 's blasphemy . 
If excuses were accepted here -- and they 're not -- then <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> would have plenty of reasons to pardon lax performance.One of their singers , a 16-year-old African immigrant , is exhausted all thetime . 
She 's desperately trying to earn her high school diploma before her visaexpires . 
She goes to night school 20 hours a week and is often doing homeworkuntil <TIME>2 a.m</TIME> . 
Yet she never misses rehearsal.Then there 's <PERSON>Michelle Wooten</PERSON> , a 17-year-old senior who wants to be a nurse . 
Shealso plans , within months , to be a mother . 
She has decided to keep the baby , though she and the father are no longer together . 
Michelle has already been toldthat she ca n't perform with the choir while she 's pregnant , but her collegescholarship wo n't be affected . 
And that , she says , is what she cares about most.Garrett understands the daily challenges that many students in the choir face.But she accepts nothing less than their best effort , and right now , they 're notgiving it . 
She steps from behind the piano , spreads her arms wide . 
Her chindrops to her chest . 
A hush falls across the room . 
" If that 's the way you 're going to sing for me , I 'm not coming " here anymore , she announces . 
<PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> 's voice is calm , loving and unequivocal . 
She gathers herpurse and quietly exits the room . 
Rehearsal is done.CHRISTMASTIME , the choir 's busy season . 
Two days ago , the students performed aspart of a larger concert at the <ORGANIZATION>National Building Museum</ORGANIZATION> with President <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> inattendance.A week earlier , they participated in the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Center Honors</ORGANIZATION> . 
Their dressingroom was just down the way from that of <PERSON>Garth Brooks</PERSON> . 
During a dress rehearsal , they spotted <PERSON>Dan Aykroyd</PERSON> and jostled one another to get a better look at LL CoolJ , who was standing onstage practicing a speech . 
You ca n't be like this , astagehand scolded them . 
In a few hours , you 're being recorded for nationaltelevision.Today the choir is bouncing down the Beltway in a yellow school bus , on the wayto <ORGANIZATION>ExxonMobil</ORGANIZATION> 's corporate offices in <LOCATION>Fairfax County</LOCATION> . 
The energy giant has hostedEastern 's singers every holiday season since <DATE>1998</DATE> . 
This is one of the choir ' smore lucrative engagements . 
The choir pulls in <MONEY>$ 2,500</MONEY> for a performance thatlasts under an hour.Patrick <PERSON>Dexter</PERSON> , community relations adviser at <ORGANIZATION>ExxonMobil</ORGANIZATION> , remembers the firsttime he heard the choir : " The room was packed , standing room only . 
They broughtdown the house . 
" While an audience of engineers and secretaries gathers , <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> takes themicrophone and gives a brief history of the choir . 
She describes it as a " vehicle for teaching a lot more than music . " 
With a grin , she talks about howroutine it is to have all of the seniors go on to college.With that , the performance begins . 
Lundy plays piano . 
Garrett directs . 
Then theyswitch rolls . 
Senior <PERSON>Garselle Davis</PERSON> steps from the alto section toward themicrophone . 
She 's singing a solo part in " Silent Night . 
" The other seniors sometimes rib Garselle because she 's so far behind in thecollege-application process . 
She 's not even sure where she wants to apply.That 's the kind of culture <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> have created : You 're not cool ifyou 're not running down a dream.But the audience only sees a girl with chipmunk cheeks and a radiant voice . 
Shemoves her hand across her body , diva-like . 
After she finishes , the audienceapplauds enthusiastically . 
" Are n't they awesome ? " 
exclaims a woman in a business suit.EASTERN HIGH SCHOOL is slowly burning . 
It 's early <DATE>spring</DATE> , and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> has beenhit with four arsons in as many school days . 
Once again , the screech of a firealarm has evacuated the building . 
The fires usually occur around this time , during or just after lunch . 
The arsonist knows that burning even a few fistfulsof notebook paper will lead to evacuation of the school . 
From there , skippingout is a cinch.Right now there are only about 40 students waiting out front to get back inside.The rest have left , either in glee or exasperation . 
A bored-looking huddle offirefighters stands by ; the small fires are often out by the time the trucksarrive.Loretta sits outside the school on a low brick wall . 
The sun shines in heralmond eyes when she looks up from her algebra book . 
It 's hard to focus on math , though she views recent events with a touch of humor . 
" The school day is notcomplete until there 's a fire , " she says with a laugh.Timothy <PERSON>Elliot</PERSON> , a computer teacher , walks past . 
" This is a felony , " he says . 
" Whoever 's doing this needs to be punished , really punished . 
" Loretta smiles at <LOCATION>Elliot</LOCATION> , who keeps a list of SAT words on the chalkboard in hisclassroom . 
" I ca n't remember what ' nuance ' means , " she says to <PERSON>Elliot</PERSON> . 
Loretta is planningto take the SATs at least once more . 
She 's recently finished a private prepcourse and is hoping to enroll in another soon.Elliot takes his hands from his pockets , relieved by the shift in conversation . 
" A nuance is a subtle detail , " the teacher says . 
" Oh , okay , " <PERSON>Loretta</PERSON> says . 
She turns back to her math.Smith emerges from the building . 
He 'd been inside with some firefighters , showing them the pitiful pile of ash that has caused so much disruption . 
Therehad been fires earlier in the year . 
But never this many in a row . 
At first , thefires were started in bathroom trash cans . 
Then <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> ordered the bathroomslocked . 
After that , students who needed to use a restroom had to track down ateacher or custodian with a key . 
Then the fires migrated to the hallway trashcans . 
So Principal <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> removed those . 
Now garbage collects on the floor fasterthan the custodians can sweep it up.Today for the first time , the arsonist has burned a locker . 
" What am I going todo ? " 
Smith wonders . 
" Take out all the lockers ? " 
" I 'm tired , " he says . 
" This is totally ridiculous . " 
Yet , he says , he is n'tconsidering returning to retirement . 
" Our children need help . 
They just do n'trealize they need help . 
" The next day , <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> stands before the student body in the gym . 
He 's called anemergency assembly to address the arsons . 
" Good morning , " he says into amicrophone . 
The students do n't stop talking . 
" Good morning , " he repeats fourmore times . 
No effect . 
He asks the teachers to help quiet the students . 
Some ofthe teachers help . 
Many do not . 
A few teachers are carrying on conversations oftheir own.Smith begins his speech anyway . 
" There is a big concern about the tone in thebuilding , " he says . 
" You are teenagers , mostly African American teenagers . 
Theworld awaits you . " 
Finally , if only for a moment , the whole room is quiet . 
" Our job is to make you successful , " <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> says . 
That can not happen in anenvironment where students and teachers do n't feel safe . 
" If you 're coming tohigh school for nonsense , do n't come to school . " 
He is addressing that small , ruinous fraction : the clowns , the hall wanderers , the arsonist ( s ) . 
" We 'll findother arrangements for you . " 
The crowd breaks into applause.But the rest of <ORGANIZATION>Smith</ORGANIZATION> 's speech does n't play as well . 
When he announces a " monetary reward " for catching the arsonist , there 's no buzz from the students , and one teacher quietly chides her boss . 
" He should say ' money , ' because thesestudents do n't understand ' monetary . ' 
" Smith talks about wanting Eastern " to regain the stature it once had . " 
Adifferent teacher says to a nearby colleague : " But you 've got to have the rightpopulation . 
These kids do n't care . " 
Smith mentions the school motto -- " ThePride of Capitol Hill " -- and there are outright scoffs from the audience . 
" We need to start a new day , " the principal concludes . 
Just then an 11th-gradeboy -- a sometime member of the choir -- begins clapping his hands like ametronome . 
He 's not applauding . 
He 's lobbing a hand grenade . 
The clap racesaround the gymnasium and momentarily takes over the room . 
A few students try tostart a stadium-style wave . 
It 's a collective thumb in <ORGANIZATION>Smith</ORGANIZATION> 's eye -- onecompounded by another fire that afternoon . 
This one empties the building just 20minutes before the end of the school day , so it probably is n't a ploy forditching class . 
Rather , the fire seems to be a message for Smith : You are notthe boss here.COFIELD WILLIAMS slides a tape into a VCR as a bus takes the choir to <ORGANIZATION>LincolnUniversity</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> for a campus tour . 
It 's a recording of the choir 's 25th-anniversary concert in <DATE>1997</DATE> . 
" That is when the choir used to be good , " saysa voice from the back of the bus . 
" The choir still is good , " <PERSON>Cofield</PERSON> says defensively . 
" We need to get sometenors , but the choir is still good . 
" The tenor section imploded earlier in the year . 
One boy quit because he wantedto play hockey . 
Another -- beautiful voice , stellar stage presence -- was kickedout of the choir because he was simply too disrespectful to <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> . 
Another tenorwound up in the hospital with chest pains and stopped coming to school for awhile.Joshua <PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON> , a standout who 's aiming for the <ORGANIZATION>Juilliard School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> , has become the choir 's lone tenor . 
For that reason , <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> havedecided to cancel the choir 's annual spring concert . 
With only one tenor , it ' sbetter not to perform at all than to perform below standard . 
" It was kind of a disappointment , " <PERSON>Cofield</PERSON> acknowledges . 
" But I understand thesituation . 
" <PERSON>Cofield</PERSON> came to <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> three years ago specifically to sing . 
Some guys atschool might mock the choir 's performers , but that does n't bother <PERSON>Cofield</PERSON> . 
Aspresident of the choir , he 's the top dog in this domain . 
Cofield often hasslesother singers about attendance , permission slips and behavior . 
He can also bethe choir 's comedian in chief . 
During one bus ride , he grabbed the microphoneand delivered a mock sermon , singing out holy hosannas between fits of laughter.He says he wants to be a teacher . 
He might consider <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln</ORGANIZATION> , the oldesthistorically black college in the country and alma mater to <PERSON>Langston Hughes</PERSON> andThurgood <PERSON>Marshall</PERSON> . 
Lincoln often recruits <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> students for its concertchoir.The rolling hills around <ORGANIZATION>Lincoln University</ORGANIZATION> are spiked with grain silos . 
Thestreets of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> seem to be a million miles away . 
The avenues of <LOCATION>Cambridge</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Mass.</LOCATION> , seem even farther . 
" I did n't get into MIT , " <PERSON>Loretta</PERSON> says , referring to her <DATE>summer</DATE> programapplication . 
She 's walking at the tail end of the tour around <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> 's small , pastoral campus . 
The voice of the tour guide , a choir alumnus , is lost in thehowl of a cold wind . 
" I know it was my SATs , " she says . 
The rejection letterconsoled her by saying there were only 40 slots and more than 700 applications . 
" I 'm not hurt . 
There will be other opportunities . 
" Loretta looks around . 
" I do n't think I 'm going to apply here . " 
Earlier in theyear , she 'd been considering historically black colleges and universities.Recently , though , she says she 's not much interested in them . 
She 's gone toblack schools all her life . 
She says she 's ready for some diversity . 
She ' sthinking about the <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> . 
It has an engineering school . 
Hermother and stepfather have offered to drive her up for a visit this summer.A little later , <PERSON>Cofield</PERSON> , along with fellow seniors <PERSON>Onteia Cohen</PERSON> and LaTaviaConner , stand in the office of <PERSON>William Garcia</PERSON> , the director of the concert choirat Lincoln . 
He says that the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern High School Choir</ORGANIZATION> has been " impeccablytrained . " 
Garcia listens to each of the students sing individually . 
He exercisestheir voices , playing scales . 
" You people have unspeakable talent , " <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> says at the end of the auditions.LORETTA SLIDES THROUGH the alto section to the microphone at center stage andlaunches into her brief solo in " From Where I Stand , " a patriotic anthem . 
Hervoice has matured over the past nine months , but she 's not happy with herperformance tonight at <ORGANIZATION>Bethesda Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Northeast Washington</LOCATION> . 
" Was I flat ? " 
Loretta asks backstage at intermission . 
Her shoulders slump withdismay . 
None of the other choir members says anything . 
She already knows theanswer . 
" I was flat , " she declares with embarrassment . 
Recently she was chosen as thepresident of next year 's choir , and she knows that the other singers are lookingto her as an example . 
At least you knew the words , someone comforts her.Okay , we 're back on , <PERSON>Patrick Lundy</PERSON> calls out in a stage whisper . 
Loretta and theother singers , dressed in blue-and-red concert robes , noiselessly fall intoformation and return to the sparsely filled sanctuary.This will be one of their final performances of the <DATE>spring</DATE> . 
The school year isalmost over , and so are <PERSON>Loretta</PERSON> 's dreams of becoming an engineer . 
Now she seesherself majoring in communications and emerging from college as a motivationalspeaker . 
Last marking period , she got a B in Algebra II : " I 'm good at math . 
Ilike it , but I do n't think that 's in my heart . " 
She also got a B in floralculture . 
She admits this with a guilty smile and can only shrug her shoulders.Most of the seniors are heading off to college . 
<ORGANIZATION>Cofield Williams</ORGANIZATION> has decided toattend <ORGANIZATION>Delaware State University</ORGANIZATION> , though he 's still awaiting his financial aidpackage . 
<PERSON>Onteia Cohen</PERSON> is going to <ORGANIZATION>Morgan State University</ORGANIZATION> on " basically a fullride . " 
<PERSON>Garselle Davis</PERSON> plans to study at <ORGANIZATION>Bennett College</ORGANIZATION> , mainly because that ' sthe alma mater of <PERSON>Joyce Garrett</PERSON> . 
<PERSON>Michelle Wooten</PERSON> wants to attend the <ORGANIZATION>Universityof the District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> part time while her infant son , <PERSON>DeAndre</PERSON> , is at daycare.But not all of the choir 's graduates are moving on to higher education . 
Onesenior , an alto , has no plans for next year . 
She says she 's going to a tradeschool , though she does n't know where , or what she 's going to study . 
And thechoir itself still faces an uncertain future . 
Fundraising this year did not gowell . 
After it disburses its scholarships , the <ORGANIZATION>Eastern Choral Society</ORGANIZATION> may face adeficit.Garrett has come up with a new plan to inject life into the choir . 
With theschool system 's blessing , <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> plans to launch a performing arts academy nextfall . 
It will feature an expanded curriculum -- music theory , sight reading , vocal music -- to students across the city . 
<PERSON>Garrett</PERSON> and <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> are hoping theschool will attract a wave of new talent , though it 's not clear if they willhave the resources to make the academy a success.Juan <PERSON>Baughn</PERSON> , the District 's assistant superintendent for high schools , initiallytells me he thinks the new program can be pulled off with <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> 's existingteachers . 
The current number of music teachers at Eastern : one . 
Apprised ofthis , <PERSON>Baughn</PERSON> concedes that another music teacher may have to be hired . 
" I ca n'tgive details at this time , " he says . 
" We may have to phase this in over twoyears . 
" At <LOCATION>Bethesda Baptist</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> stands before the congregation . 
The second half ofthe performance is going to be all gospel . 
" We 're not in an academic setting , " he calls out . 
" We 're gon na have some church in here tonight , show you what thesekids can do . 
" He turns to face his singers . 
With one quick gesture , he releases sweet thunderfrom 47 young mouths . 
Half a dozen choir alumni , home from college , are singingwith their former schoolmates . 
The sound is ferocious , lifting the smallaudience to its feet . 
Loretta 's face , like those around her , is at once joyous , pained and illuminated with a faith in limitless possibility . 
When the studentssmile , it 's not because <PERSON>Lundy</PERSON> told them to -- though he did -- but because theyare singing . 
There is nothing they 'd rather be doing.Tyler <PERSON>Currie</PERSON> is a frequent contributor to the Magazine .
