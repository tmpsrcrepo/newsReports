The story of a female badass fighting an army of thugs sent by the mobster/lovershe 's informing on , " Everly " is a B movie , in air quotes . 
It 's less an homage tothe kind of grindhouse films celebrated by <PERSON>Quentin Tarantino</PERSON> than it is aslavish aping of <PERSON>Tarantino</PERSON> 's postmodern oeuvre itself . 
The " Pulp Fiction " filmmaker 's bloody fingerprints are all over this film 's corpse.But director <PERSON>Joe Lynch</PERSON> is no Tarantino . 
His title character - a vessel of femaleempowerment along the lines of the vengeful bride of " Kill Bill " - is , to put itas charitably as possible , a crock.Salma <PERSON>Hayek</PERSON> makes for a game but only fitfully entertaining <LOCATION>Everly</LOCATION> . 
She 's thekind of character who , in the good old days , used to be known as a gangster ' smoll , but who is here referred to as a " whore " - a term that captures , lesseuphemistically , the transactional nature of her relationship with <ORGANIZATION>Taiko</ORGANIZATION> ( <PERSON>Hiroyuki Watanabe</PERSON> ) , the Japanese criminal she 's been sleeping with and spyingon.Setting the nasty tone for the tale , " Everly " opens with the sounds of Everly ' soff-camera gang rape by <ORGANIZATION>Taiko</ORGANIZATION> 's goons . 
Later , when one of those henchmen ( AkieKotabe ) - the only one <LOCATION>Everly</LOCATION> has n't killed in the gun battle following herassault - points out that he did n't join in , <LOCATION>Everly</LOCATION> responds , " Should I beoffended ? 
" Yuck.Though meant to be sardonic ( I hope ) , her comment undermines screenwriter YaleHannon 's message that female power comes from strength , not sex . 
Equallyretrograde are the six sexpot assassins who , one after the other , burst throughthe door of <LOCATION>Everly</LOCATION> 's apartment in a variety of skimpy costumes ( such as the SexySchoolgirl ) before getting killed by the heroine.Yes , it 's all in good fun . 
And there 's a certain verve to the way Lynch handlesthe violence , even if he 's less of a stylist than <PERSON>Tarantino</PERSON> . 
But the film ' sbrutality - which includes not only the murder of a dog but also a fetishizationof torture that borders on porn - is so excessive , even if tongue-in-cheek , thatit leaves a bad taste in the mouth.Late in the film , one of <LOCATION>Everly</LOCATION> 's tormentors , a man known only as the Sadist ( <LOCATION>Togo Igawa</LOCATION> ) , shows up with a bloody , half-naked guy in a cage ( MasashiFujimoto ) . 
The caged guy is introduced as the Masochist . 
But at that point inthe movie , you may be forgiven for thinking that was your role.michael.osullivan@washpost.comR .
