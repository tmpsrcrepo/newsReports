Reprinted from <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> 's editionsAs they unveiled the banner for ChangeTheMascot.org on the second floor of theRitz-Carlton in <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> , amid a standing-room-only crowd of cameras , mediaand the concerned , everything came into focus Monday.Before an <ORGANIZATION>Oneida Nation</ORGANIZATION> leader even called the team name a racial slur for thefirst time from the podium , before a <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> psychologist logically connectedthe dots - between the burnt sienna-pigmented face on a helmet with the linedrawn through it in the background to the utter hopelessness on reservations - you just knew : Even if he remains in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for his entire <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> career , <PERSON>Robert Griffin</PERSON> IIIis not going to retire an R-word . 
It 's not a matter of " if " anymore , but rather " when . 
" The debate over whether a people are denigrated or honored by the name of theWashington <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> team , like the absurd debate over whether the name is a unifyingforce , is over.How many of the more than 5 million American Indians in this country actuallywant the name gone - how many need to be offended - is approaching irrelevant.We 're quickly moving past all that.The question is how long before <PERSON>Roger Goodell</PERSON> or any of the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> commissioner ' sbrightest lawyers deem that a prolonged public assault against the name becomesfinancially hazardous to the league 's future . 
Just when is the tipping point?The answer , we found out <DATE>Monday</DATE> , is now.League officials have reached out to the <ORGANIZATION>Oneida Nation</ORGANIZATION> , which sponsored <DATE>Monday</DATE> ' ssymposium and suddenly has been passed the name-change baton from <PERSON>Suzan ShownHarjo</PERSON> after more than two decades.The <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> , through <PERSON>Adolphus Birch</PERSON> , its senior vice president of labor policy andgovernment affairs , has asked that a meeting originally scheduled for <DATE>Nov. 22</DATE> bemoved up - and , if needed , to the Oneida reservation in <LOCATION>Verona</LOCATION> , N.Y.Think about that : The <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> , which has spent tens of thousands of dollarsdefending the team from American Indian plaintiffs seeking to strip itstrademark in court for the better part of two decades , has offered to go to theres to talk.Tiring of the sustained momentum the issue has gained since the beginning of theyear , including a national radio ad campaign denouncing the team 's name in eachcity it plays - tired of the widespread publicity , which runs the gamut from theIndian Country Today media network to <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> 's " Meet the Press " - <PERSON>Goodell</PERSON> has sentan emissary to act on his behalf.The commissioner and others also may be tired of team owner <PERSON>Daniel Snyder</PERSON> 's coldbrazenness toward the offended . 
They simply ca n't take his tone-deafness on theissue anymore ; it 's bad business.If the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> is as boxed in as it appears and <PERSON>Birch</PERSON> and others from the leagueoffice are n't going on a patronizing <LOCATION>P.R.</LOCATION> mission , this is the first step in thematter being taken out of <PERSON>Snyder</PERSON> 's hands - the first clear indication that thename is eventually going down.I thought this past winter it might happen within 10 years . 
My guess now is fiveyears or less , maybe three - and that 's just to accommodate the time it willtake to reach a settlement with the team , find a new name and license , marketand promote it.If the matter escalates further and a national boycott of team and leaguesponsors is needed , oh well.Either way , after years of waiting for the caravan of angry protesters to pass , it 's over . 
As <PERSON>Ray Halbritter</PERSON> , the impassioned , thoughtful front man for <ORGANIZATION>theOneida Nation</ORGANIZATION> said <DATE>Monday</DATE> , " This is not going away this time . " 
" We want change , change not only in more than a symbolic way but change in thelives of the American Indian people - particularly our children , " Halbrittersaid . 
" I think a potential meeting can only lead to a conversation that will bebeneficial , " he added . 
Asked if <PERSON>Snyder</PERSON> would be a part of the group , Halbritterreplied : " I do n't know . 
If he is , we welcome his participation . 
But right now , it 's only the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> that is responding to us positively . 
" The leader of the free world saying over the weekend that he would thinkseriously about changing the name was clearly historic news , the first time asitting <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> president had taken a stand on the issue . 
It also revealed anothersignificant development : <PERSON>Snyder</PERSON> has hired a crisis management specialist - notjust any chaos control guy but <PERSON>Lanny Davis</PERSON> , who has represented <PERSON>Trent Lott</PERSON> , <PERSON>Martha Stewart</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> in the wake of a child sexual-abuse scandal and beenrebuked by human rights groups for trying to portray ruthless foreignwar-mongers as peaceful people.Really , for all the work <PERSON>Harjo</PERSON> did to eradicate the name for parts of threedecades , for everything <PERSON>Halbritter</PERSON> and others do now , the person who did themost to amplify the message of the ChangeTheMascot.org crowd is Snyder himself.When <ORGANIZATION>USA Today</ORGANIZATION> 's <PERSON>Erik Brady</PERSON> asked about the issue in <DATE>May</DATE> , the owner 's hubris gotthe best of him : " We 'll never change the name , " <PERSON>Snyder</PERSON> said . 
" It 's that simple.NEVER - you can use caps . 
" That was it . 
That was enough to mobilize many of the apathetic and ambivalent tojoin the advocates and the hard-core activists . 
When a billionaire takes aposition as a bully instead of at least acknowledging the people who areoffended , then he starts to lose what middle ground remained.Now he 's hired <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> to speak for Burgundy and <ORGANIZATION>Gold Nation</ORGANIZATION> , whose most ardent,pro-name faction still has no clue there is a larger group of people nowspeaking on behalf of how wrong the team 's name is.It 's not the <ORGANIZATION>Oneida Nation</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Cherokee Nation</ORGANIZATION> or any one of 450-plus federallyrecognized sovereign peoples . 
It 's called the world 's tribe , and it is biggerand infinitely more powerful than an 80-year-old fan base and its idea of " tradition . 
" Brace yourselves for change . 
Five years tops , it 's gone .
