It 's the moment that will change the law of the land . 
After months of secretdeliberations , the justices of <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> have reached a decision in acase that has been in litigation for years . 
With complete silence in the whitemarble courtroom , a black-robed justice begins to announce the majority opinion.Each justice stamps the moment with his or her distinctive style . 
Some arelong-faced and somber . 
Some speak off-the-cuff . 
Some are professorial , explaining the nuances of the law to the spectators on the velvet benches . 
Somelet a little whimsy fly . 
" It 's technical and complex , " Justice <PERSON>Anthony M. Kennedy</PERSON> said as he began toexplain a death penalty ruling last week , and then quipped , " even by ourstandards . 
" A justice 's announcement , which may culminate months of negotiation andrewriting among the high court nine , gives the author a chance to emphasize -- outloud -- what he or she thinks important . 
It is standard to present a summary ofthe key points in the lengthy written opinion that will be immediatelydistributed to the press and public . 
But from the tall mahogany bench , justicesoften add a personal touch.Geography buff that he is , Chief Justice <PERSON>William H. Rehnquist</PERSON> will comment onwhere the dispute arose . 
In a recent <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> drug search case , the chief recountedthat a <ORGANIZATION>Border Patrol</ORGANIZATION> agent had been inspecting luggage at a federal checkpointin <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Blanca</ORGANIZATION> , which <PERSON>Rehnquist</PERSON> helpfully noted is 80 miles east of El Paso.When criminal defendants have challenged the constitutionality of their cases , <PERSON>Rehnquist</PERSON> , as well as Justice <PERSON>Antonin Scalia</PERSON> , is apt to direct attention to thegruesome details of the murder or rape that began the dispute.A year ago , <ORGANIZATION>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</ORGANIZATION> declared that students may sue forsevere and pervasive sexual harassment by other students , observing that JusticeKennedy was predicting schools would be inundated with lawsuits and that thedecision would teach " little Johnny a perverse lesson in federalism . " 
No , thecourt 's first female justice said tersely , the decision would make sure " thatlittle <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> may attend class . 
" On the last day of the term last year , when the court issued three 5 to 4decisions curtailing <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> 's power to make its laws binding on the states , the dramatic bench announcements went on for nearly an hour . 
First , the authorsof the three rulings -- <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Scalia</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Rehnquist</PERSON> -- forcefully delivered theiropinions for the court . 
" <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> has vast power but not all power , " <PERSON>Kennedy declared.Then</PERSON> , one by one , Justices <PERSON>David H. Souter</PERSON> , <PERSON>Stephen G. Breyer</PERSON> and <PERSON>John PaulStevens</PERSON> hammered home their dissenting views . 
Reading from a prepared text inhis characteristic midwestern twang , <PERSON>Stevens</PERSON> claimed the majority was " much likea mindless dragon that indiscriminately chews gaping holes in federal statutes . 
" Usually the announcements last only a few suspenseful minutes . 
In a long-goneera , the justices used to read the whole opinion word-for-word -- an enterprisethat could take hours and sometimes days . 
That changed in the <DATE>1930s</DATE> when ChiefJustice <PERSON>Charles Evans Hughes</PERSON> , who believed it was a waste of the court 's time , began encouraging summaries . 
And for the most part these bench announcements , which come fast and furious in the months of <DATE>May</DATE> and <DATE>June</DATE> , now are kept to thepoint.Justice <PERSON>Ruth Bader Ginsburg</PERSON> , who sits erect in her seat at the far right end ofthe bench , reads from a prepared text that she then makes available to thepress . 
In careful , measured cadence , <PERSON>Ginsburg</PERSON> repeats the facts , the law and theresolution of the case , eschewing any levity.At the other end of the bench is <PERSON>Breyer</PERSON> , who hunches over his opinion , improvising , offering casual asides to the audience and assuming the familiaraura of a professor before a group of undergraduates . 
When Justice ClarenceThomas reads from his majority opinion , the audience has a chance to hear thedeep , booming voice of the one justice who rarely speaks up during oralarguments.While all of the justices today take advantage of their moment on center stage , the late Justice <PERSON>Byron R. White</PERSON> ( 1962-93 ) remains notorious for his rejection ofthe ritual . 
He would brusquely announce that a lower court ruling had beenaffirmed or reversed , harrumph , and add , " for reasons on file with the clerk . 
" Full Court Press runs on the first <DATE>Monday</DATE> of the month . 
<PERSON>Joan Biskupic</PERSON> appearsFriday mornings on washingtonpost.com to answer questions about the SupremeCourt.CORRECTION-DATE : <DATE>May 2</DATE> , 2000CORRECTION : Because of an editing error , an article <DATE>May 1</DATE> incorrectly described Byron R.White . 
He is a retired <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> justice .
