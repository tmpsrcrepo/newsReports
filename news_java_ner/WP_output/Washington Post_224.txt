On the morning of <DATE>Jan. 26</DATE> , <PERSON>Sharif Mobley</PERSON> stepped out of his apartment in <LOCATION>Sanaa</LOCATION> , the capital of <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> , to buy some cereal for his sleeping 3-year-old daughter.The young American from <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> was quickly surrounded by eight black-clad , masked operatives from the country 's secret police . 
Mobley turned to run , but hewas shot in the leg and bundled into the back of a white van . 
When Mobleyshouted " I 'm an American , " he was hit in the face . 
As the van sped away , <PERSON>Mobleylater</PERSON> told his lawyers , one of his Yemeni captors made a call . 
The man said onlyone word , in English : " Easy . 
" Eight months later , the 26-year-old is set to go on trial this month for killinga prison guard , a crime punishable by death . 
In <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> , the condemned areexecuted in a public square with a single bullet to the heart.U.S . 
officials see <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> as one of a growing cadre of native-born Americans whoare drawn to violent jihad . 
" This does n't seem to be a case of the accidentalextremist , " said one <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official who would speak only on the condition ofanonymity because the matter is before the courts in <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> . 
" He sought out badactors before leaving the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and certainly joined up with terroristsafter moving to <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> . 
That includes , among other things , putting his ideas forterrorist attacks on the table . 
" Mobley 's defenders acknowledge that he associated in <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> with individualshostile to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> but say he never conspired to commit an act ofterrorism . 
They say they believe that <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> interrogators , trawling forintelligence , pushed <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> into a moment of madness that allegedly resulted inthe murder of one guard and the wounding of another . 
" This is a man who had been kidnapped and shot , spent six weeks being variouslyshackled , blindfolded and beaten , and who was terrified that the same wasawaiting his wife and two babies , " said <PERSON>Cori Crider</PERSON> , one of <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> 's attorneys , who works with the London-based human rights group Reprieve and has met withMobley in prison . 
" <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> agents preyed on those fears . 
" This account of the coming-of-age of a young Muslim in the post-9 / 11 era isbased on exclusive interviews with <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> 's father and wife ; his lawyers ; friends , relatives and former acquaintances ; and with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Yemeni officials.It provides the first complete portrait of <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> 's journey to violent jihad andincludes new details about his contacts with a radical cleric , <PERSON>Anwar al-Aulaqi</PERSON> , who is on a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> capture-or-kill list for his role in terrorist attacks.American investigators suspected that <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> could lead them to Aulaqi.The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the case or <PERSON>Crider</PERSON> 's allegations . 
A spokesman forthe <ORGANIZATION>Yemeni Embassy</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> said his government would have no officialcomment.Mobley 's lawyers , who include counsel from a leading Yemeni human rightsorganization , note that Yemeni authorities have dropped all terrorism-relatedcharges and moved <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> 's case into the criminal courts . 
Dismissing the U.S.allegation that <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> actively plotted with a group affiliated with al-Qaeda , they say that at the first hint of trouble , <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> sought to return to theUnited States . 
" This is just a false excuse for a botched job , " said <PERSON>Crider</PERSON> , referring toMobley 's arrest and interrogation . 
" If <PERSON>Sharif Mobley</PERSON> was plotting to hurt asingle soul , why did n't the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> arrest him when he - repeatedly - presentedhimself at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> , asking their help to see his family safely home . 
" Mobley was the youngest of five children who were raised partly in a spacioushome on five acres in the <LOCATION>South Jersey</LOCATION> farming community of <ORGANIZATION>Buena</ORGANIZATION> . 
His father , <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> , originally from <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> , had joined <ORGANIZATION>the Nation of Islam</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1966</DATE> . 
His mother , <PERSON>Cynthia</PERSON> , who was born in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> , converted when the couplemarried . 
Both sides of <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> 's family have deep roots in the <ORGANIZATION>United States.When Nation</ORGANIZATION> of Islam leader <PERSON>Elijah Muhammad</PERSON> died in <DATE>1975</DATE> , the Mobleys gravitatedto an orthodox Sunni branch of Islam , attending a largely African Americanmosque in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> . 
The family moved to <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE> , shortly beforeSharif was born , in <DATE>January 1984</DATE> . 
" Kids grow fast in the city , " said CharlesMobley , a retired construction worker , explaining the decision to move out ofPhiladelphia.Former students at <ORGANIZATION>Buena Regional High School</ORGANIZATION> remember Mobley as very religious , with a small circle of friends . 
" He was always devout . 
Always trying to convertfriends , always being so literal to the point that even if he kissed a girl , heasked friends to whip him , " said <PERSON>Roman Castro</PERSON> , a former classmate who wasfriends with <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> in high school . 
" He was 100 percent into everything he did . 
" <PERSON>Charles Mobley</PERSON> remembers him as deeply committed to his faith . 
" He was strongerinto the religion than I was , " his father said.Mobley was also becoming more political . 
<PERSON>Castro</PERSON> , who enlisted in the militaryfollowing graduation , said <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> and some other friends from high schoolvisited him in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> on the <DATE>July 4 weekend</DATE> in <DATE>2003</DATE> , before <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> leftfor <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> . 
But the visit ended badly , and <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> returned early and alone to <ORGANIZATION>NewJersey</ORGANIZATION> . 
" He was very Sharif-esque ; it was only a matter of time before he would get intopolitical discussions and religious discussions , and arguments got heated , " <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> said . 
" We had a falling out . 
" Mobley 's father acknowledged the tension among the old school friends . 
" Sharifdid n't believe in fighting in the war , " he said . 
" He had the same view asMuhammad Ali had about fighting other people . 
" But if some of <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> 's friends saw increasing rigidity , his family and friendssaw a much lighter side of his personality . 
" If he were in a classroom , he wouldbe the class clown , " said <PERSON>Zaki Bey</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> 's brother-in-law . 
Bey recalled thatonce when he visited <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> , his brother-in-law back-flipped off a second-storybalcony and landed on his feet . 
" He was that kind of adventurous , goofball typeof guy , " Bey said.After high school , <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> 's father got him a union card , and he got spot work asan unskilled laborer , including at nuclear power plants in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> andPennsylvania.Much of the early reporting of <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> 's arrest focused on his employment at theplants , suggesting that he might have had access to sensitive material . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>Nuclear Regulatory Commission</ORGANIZATION> has completed its review of the dates Mr.Mobley worked as a general laborer at several <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> nuclear power plants , including the types of job duties he performed . 
To date , there has been noevidence of any security-related concerns or incidents related to his employmentat these plants , " said <PERSON>Neil Sheehan</PERSON> , a spokesman for the NRC.The early reports also erroneously said his family had immigrated from Somalia.In <DATE>2004</DATE> , <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> made his first pilgrimage to Mecca . 
" You could see him maturinginto adulthood , still personable , still humorous , but not giddy all the time , " said <PERSON>Mervin Khalil Ghani</PERSON> , who owns a bookstore specializing in Islamic andAfrican American literature in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> and who accompanied <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> to Mecca.A black belt in Taekwondo who had excelled in martial arts and wrestling in highschool , <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> lost his interest in competition after the pilgrimage . 
The manytrophies he won in his youth still crowd a corner of his bedroom in his parents ' house.Mobley went on the hajj two more times as a guide with groups from thePhiladelphia area . 
His religious observance became stricter.Gregory <PERSON>Marisseau</PERSON> , who worked with <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> , said his friend would always try tosay his prayers at the mosque , including the first prayer before dawn.Around this time , <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> returned from his tour in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> and ran into <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> onthe street . 
His old friend treated him with disdain , <PERSON>Castro</PERSON> said , calling him a " Muslim killer . 
" In the <DATE>summer of 2005</DATE> , <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> was introduced to <PERSON>Nzinga Saba Islam</PERSON> , aPhiladelphia native who had just graduated from <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> High School forGirls , and three months later they were married . 
The couple 's first child , agirl , was born in <DATE>January 2007</DATE> . 
In <DATE>July 2007</DATE> , the couple moved to <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> , where Mobley began attendinga mosque whose congregation was largely made up of immigrants , a communitydifferent from the mosques of his youth . 
Islam said the couple had talked forsome time about moving to an Arab country to learn the language and deepen theirknowledge of their religion . 
She said they began to consider moving to Yemenafter striking up a friendship with a family from <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> they met in Delaware.They also contacted an American in <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> whose teachings they had heard onreligious CDs : Aulaqi.Mobley 's wife said that her husband e-mailed the cleric , seeking advice on wherehe should study in Yemen.Aulaqi 's CDs and tapes can be found in many Muslim homes , and in the aftermathof the <DATE>Sept. 11 , 2001</DATE> , attacks he seemed to be a moderate voice , appearing , forinstance , on a video on washingtonpost.com to explain <LOCATION>Ramadan</LOCATION> . 
Islam said sheand her husband knew of Aulaqi only as a popular preacher.But by <DATE>2008</DATE> , after leaving the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and being jailed for a time inYemen , <PERSON>Aulaqi</PERSON> was sounding a call for violent jihad , attacking the West andpredicting a global clash between Muslims and non-believers . 
<LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials saythey believe <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> wanted to volunteer for the fight , and hid his true intentunder the guise of attending language school in Yemen.Mobley and his wife and daughter left for <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> in <DATE>July 2008</DATE> , but did n't lastlong in the country . 
Islam was pregnant and experienced complications . 
She saidher husband met with <PERSON>Aulaqi</PERSON> to discuss where she might get medical care . 
InOctober , following Islam 's surgery for an ectopic pregnancy , the couple returnedto the <ORGANIZATION>United</ORGANIZATION> States.Against the wishes of their families , they were determined to go back to <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> . 
" We did n't start what we intended to do . 
We said , ' let 's try one more time , ' " said Islam , 22 , who wears pastel scarves to cover her hair but does not veil herface . 
" Our parents wanted to kill us . 
They did n't want us to go . 
" In <DATE>December</DATE> , the couple made it back to <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> , and Islam became pregnant again.She spent much of the year on bed rest , and in <DATE>November 2009</DATE> gave birth to theirson.The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official said that <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> only infrequently attended language classthrough <DATE>2009</DATE> and was instead " doing things like facilitating the movement ofextremists to <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> on behalf of " al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.On <DATE>Christmas Day 2009</DATE> , a Nigerian passenger allegedly attempted to down a U.S.airliner by igniting explosives hidden in his underwear , an attack that wasquickly traced to the al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen.Mobley 's wife said that the atmosphere in the country soured rapidly for thecouple , and that they resolved to go home as quickly as possible . 
They made anappointment for early <DATE>February</DATE> to get a passport for the newborn . 
Mobley alsowent to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> to get extra pages in his passport for an exit visa , and was interviewed by <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agents in the legal attache 's office during severalvisits.A second <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official , who also insisted on anonymity to discuss an open case , said that <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> was " circular " and " uncooperative " when he met with the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> . 
" He got himself into this , " the official said . 
" He 's a very difficult guy whocreates most of his own problems . 
" Islam said that her husband felt he was being followed , and soon enough she alsosaw surveillance by unknown Yemenis . 
" We were scared , " she said . 
" We said , ' let 's just go home . ' 
" Until they could get on a plane out of <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> , they decided not to leave theirapartment except to go to the embassy or get food.After being shot during his arrest by members of <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> 's Political SecurityOrganization , <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> was taken to a secure , third-floor ward of a hospital thata German company runs for <ORGANIZATION>Yemen 's Interior Ministry</ORGANIZATION> . 
Mobley 's femur wasshattered , and doctors operated on his leg on <DATE>Jan. 26</DATE> , according to a letter thehospital sent to <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> 's lawyers.Mobley asked to speak to his wife and the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Crider</PERSON> , one of hisattorneys , said . 
His request was ignored , and after four days , he said he wouldstop eating until someone came to help him.That is when two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> agents showed up , according to <PERSON>Crider</PERSON> . 
They introducedthemselves as <PERSON>Matt</PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> and Khan from the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Defense</ORGANIZATION> . 
Andover the next several weeks , they questioned Mobley six times . 
One or twoYemenis were always in the room , but took almost no part in the questioning , <PERSON>Crider</PERSON> said.They had one major focus . 
" Aulaqi . 
You help us find him , and you 'll go home , " said <PERSON>Crider</PERSON> , describing the interrogations . 
She said <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> said he had spokento <PERSON>Aulaqi</PERSON> , but did n't know where he was and so was unable to help . 
" They held up the keys to his house in front of his face , " <PERSON>Crider</PERSON> said . 
" Theytold him his wife would go to prison and the kids would go to an orphanage . 
Hewas terrified that she was going to be assaulted . 
" When <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> did not come home with the cereal , his wife grew frantic . 
She calledthe <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> , where officials told her to go to her local police station andreport him missing . 
That night , she recalled , four Yemeni men in suits and about15 soldiers searched the couple 's apartment , taking away their computer . 
Islamsaid she saw one of the men in suits the next morning at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Embassy</ORGANIZATION> , wearing a visitor 's badge . 
She said one <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official dismissed her concernsabout the search . 
" You should be used to that . 
You 're from <LOCATION>Philly</LOCATION> , " he told her.Islam said she pressed <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> officials for information for weeks until familymembers decided she should bring the children home.After three to four weeks , <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> 's Yemeni captors told him he would be moved toa prison . 
On the day he was transferred , a catheter was removed , but badly , andMobley started to bleed again during the transport . 
" When they unload him , he falls , and they kick him and call him a dog , " Cridersaid . 
" They drag him down some stairs and toss him on a table , and he losesconsciousness . 
" After just a few hours in the prison , she said , the profusely bleeding Mobleywas moved to a general hospital.There his treatment improved . 
He was n't always blindfolded and shackled , and theguards , some of whom seemed to warm to him , would put their guns down in theroom.The two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> agents also visited . 
But after weeks of questioning , they appearedfrustrated with <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> , repeating the suggestion that his wife could end up inprison but getting nowhere . 
" His behavior was not very helpful to his cause , " said the second <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official . 
" I think at that point the plan was to wait for him to be deported , " Cridersaid . 
" They realized he was a dead end . 
" On the evening of <DATE>March 6</DATE> , <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> and his guards watched the <PERSON>Mel Gibson</PERSON> movie " Braveheart , " <PERSON>Crider</PERSON> said . 
In one scene , a soldier attempts to rape the wife ofthe character played by <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> , and the woman is later executed . 
The events helppropel the <PERSON>Gibson</PERSON> character into a vengeful rampage against his oppressors.Mobley " is going crazy about his family , " <PERSON>Crider</PERSON> said . 
" He is begging everyoneto call his family . 
" The next day , <DATE>March 7</DATE> , according to Yemeni officials , <ORGANIZATION>Mobley</ORGANIZATION> grabbed a gun andkilled a guard in an unsuccessful attempt to free himself . 
A second guard waswounded.What no one had told <PERSON>Mobley</PERSON> was that his wife and two children had left for theUnited States 72 hours earlier.On the morning of <DATE>Jan. 26</DATE> , <PERSON>Sharif Mobley</PERSON> stepped out of his apartment in <LOCATION>Sanaa</LOCATION> , the capital of <LOCATION>Yemen</LOCATION> , to buy some cereal for his sleeping 3-year-old daughter.The young American from <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> was quickly surrounded by eight black-clad , masked operatives from the country 's secret police .
