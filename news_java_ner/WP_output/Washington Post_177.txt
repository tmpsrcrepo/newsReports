" Gregory 's been the show 's host for the past four years . 
He replaced <PERSON>Tim Russert</PERSON> , who had the gig for 16 years until he died on the job in <DATE>June 2008</DATE> . 
This TV season , " Meet the Press " is averaging 3.2 million viewers - second tothe CBS <DATE>Sunday</DATE> Beltway show " Face the Nation " ( 3.3 million ) . 
The first half is , anyway . 
<ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION> breaks its show into two programs for ratings purposes because , as it has explained in the past , the second , newer half-hour does not have asmany station clearances as the first half-hour . 
( " Face 1 " is cleared in 99percent of the country , while " Face 2 " is available in <PERCENT>84 percent</PERCENT> . ) 
Since <PERSON>Russert</PERSON> 's final full season , " MtP " has lost <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of its audience . 
" FtN , " on the other hand - which is still anchored by <PERSON>Bob Schieffer</PERSON> - has gained23 percent.ABC 's " This Week , " now anchored once again by <PERSON>George Stephanopoulos</PERSON> , trails theother two programs with an average audience of 2.7 million this season . 
On thebright side , that 's up considerably compared with The Christiane Amanpour Years.Before taking over the anchor chair on " MtP , " <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION>NBC News</ORGANIZATION> 's chief <ORGANIZATION>WhiteHouse</ORGANIZATION> correspondent ; he joined <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>' 95</DATE> .

' Rihanna : SVU'After flopping with a <DATE>February</DATE> " sweep " stunt in which a convicted rapist wascast as a rape victim , " Law & Order : SVU " - now a sadder but wiser sex-crimesdrama - has gone back to what the franchise does best : rip from the headlines.This time , it 's <PERSON>Chris Brown</PERSON> and Rihanna.On the final night of the <DATE>February</DATE> sweep next week , an episode called " FunnyValentine " will feature a story line about a rising young music star who isphysically beaten by her high-profile music-star boyfriend . 
The victim refusesto help the prosecution and , despite <PERSON>Mariska Hargitay</PERSON> 's best efforts , continuesto put herself in danger . 
Meanwhile , the case gets turned into a media circusbecause of the antics of the abuser guy and his attorney ( <PERSON>Jeffrey Tambor</PERSON> ) . 
Over its lifetime , the " Law & Order " franchise has become famous for rippingfrom the headlines , with just enough tinkering to keep lawyers at bay . 
Oftenthat tinkering involves someone getting snuffed.We hope the episode will make some noise for <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> , which is poised to finish theFebruary sweep in fifth place among the 18-to-49-year-olds who are the network ' sad-sales holy grail.That would mark the first time that the network has finished behind <ORGANIZATION>Univision</ORGANIZATION> inthe age bracket during a sweep . 
So far , <ORGANIZATION>Univision</ORGANIZATION> has beaten <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> every night ofthe sweep.Among <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> 's <DATE>February</DATE> sweep ratings debacles : The highly hyped launch of itsJekyll/Hyde doc drama , " Do No Harm , " resulted in historically low ratings andwas quickly euthanized , and the Season 2 launch of " Smash " crashed and burned.Just a year ago , <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> easily won the <DATE>February</DATE> sweep . 
On the other hand , <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> lastyear had the Super Bowl and " The <ORGANIZATION>Voice</ORGANIZATION> .
