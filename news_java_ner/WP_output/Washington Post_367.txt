Americans say they want to be represented by " real people " and not by " professional politicians . " 
But with their votes they reward professionalism anddrain the reality from politics . 
Real people have n't spent their lives plottinga political career , and therefore real people may have said things from time totime that an aspiring politician would not . 
Departures from the official scriptare called gaffes . 
This election year , the script has been more important thanever . 
Despite the <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> war , despite the sinking economy , despite the price ofgasoline , we have frittered away our politics in a round robin of gaffes , mockindignation and demands for apology.The surest way to stumble into a gaffe is to tell a joke . 
Jokes are risky ; theyare a game of percentages . 
That is why jokes are best left to professionaljokesters . 
Certainly they are too dangerous for politicians to play with . 
Anyjoke that does n't offend at least a few people is unlikely to be funny . 
You haveto hope that many more will be amused than are offended . 
You have to come asclose as you can to the line of justifiable , widespread offense without crossingit . 
This is why I never found <PERSON>George Carlin</PERSON> , who died last month , terriblyfunny : He walked up to the line and simply crossed it . 
Where is the art in that?The professional politician , by contrast , lives to avoid giving offense . 
Thisis n't easy . 
In today 's Culture of Umbrage , taking offense is a major sport.Everybody is on hair-trigger alert . 
And once a voter is offended , he or she isprobably lost . 
On the other hand , keeping the voters amused is difficult andprobably not worth the trouble . 
A voter who is amused may vote against youanyway or may seize an opportunity to take offense and turn against youtomorrow.This year a professional jokester , Al Franken ( D ) , is challenging a professionalpolitician , incumbent Norm <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> ( R ) , for a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat in <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> . 
Notevery joke <PERSON>Franken</PERSON> wrote or told over a third of a century in the joke businesswas hilarious , okay ? 
Minnesota voters will have to decide whether their dislikeof professional politicians trumps their enjoyment in taking umbrage , or viceversa . 
<PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> is a man of no interest , a run-of-the-mill professionalpolitician who started out as a standard issue long-haired student rebel leaderon <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and surfed the zeitgeist until now . 
Today he is astandard-issue pro-war tax-cut Republican . 
Franken , by contrast , needs nointroduction and from Day One would be one of the most interesting people in theSenate . 
" Interesting , " of course , is n't the most important quality in a senator . 
" Honest , " " smart " and ( for my taste ) " liberal " are more important . 
But " interesting " would be nice.Franken 's problem is that he spent three decades as a professional comedianbefore turning to politics and thus has a large inventory of potential gaffematerial to explain away : a <DATE>1995</DATE> magazine article describing Franken asproposing rude , unfunny jokes about rape at a <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>Night</TIME> Live staff meeting ; a <DATE>2000</DATE> article in Playboy fantasizing about three-way sex with robots ( orsomething ) ; an ungallant crack about women in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> ( a place Franken hasvisited repeatedly with the USO ) ; and so on . 
Take the <ORGANIZATION>SNL</ORGANIZATION> staff meeting : None ofFranken 's rude fantasies made it onto the air , and there is no evidence that heespecially wanted them to . 
He was thinking out loud , an activity vital toprofessional comics and fatal to professional politicians . 
The only way ameeting to plan a comedy show can possibly work is if everybody feels free tosay absolutely anything . 
If comedy writers are thinking " I 'd better not say thatbecause it may not be funny and in 13 years I may decide to run for the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> , " we will end up with fewer good jokes on TV and even fewer interesting people inthe Senate.Franken ( a slight but friendly acquaintance of mine ) is in a quandary . 
He ca n'tstop his campaign to defend every joke he 's ever written that someone now findsoffensive , or pretends to . 
Trying to explain a joke is notoriously pointlessanyway . 
But <PERSON>Franken</PERSON> also ca n't let his opponent create the impression that he issome kind of sexist monster , rather than the long-married , deeply uxoriousfamily man that he is , with the progressive views on abortion choice and relatedissues that you would expect from a Democratic liberal . 
If the voters ofMinnesota would rather be represented by a hack like <PERSON>Norm Coleman</PERSON> than laugh offa few jokes that did n't work , then they should stop complaining about beingstuck with professional politicians . 
And the real joke will be on them.Michael <PERSON>Kinsley</PERSON> is a columnist for <ORGANIZATION>Time magazine</ORGANIZATION> and regular contributor towashingtonpost.com .
