The bars near the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> were packed on graduation day , seniorsin billowing black gowns drinking away their final few hours before entering thereal world . 
Itwas <TIME>7 a.m.</TIME> Â ¶ Waiters and bartenders , many of whom had workeduntil the <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> shift ended a few hours earlier , shuttled pitchers ofBloody <ORGANIZATION>Marys</ORGANIZATION> , mimosas and manmosas ( beer , vodka and orange juice ) and pouredround after round of shots : cinnamon fireballs , <ORGANIZATION>Southern Comfort</ORGANIZATION> with lime , andstraighttequila . 
Â ¶ " Sweet Caroline " blared as sorority sisters in flip-flops danced andsipped mixed drinks at the Virginian.At the <LOCATION>Biltmore</LOCATION> , the bouncer waved in anyone wearing commencement garb . 
ThePigeon Hole put out a chalkboard sign that originally read " Graduate in style ! 
" but someonehad crossed out " in style " and written " under the influence ! 
" At <ORGANIZATION>Trinity Irish Pub</ORGANIZATION> , students crammed onto a balcony that provided the perfectspot to look for friends and snap photos . 
Below , dozens more gathered on apatio , drinking on who-knows-whose bill . 
" Our tab is already <MONEY>$ 400</MONEY> ! " 
one student excitedly announced from atop a blackmetal chair at about <TIME>8:20 a.m.</TIME> , with another solid hour left before they weredue at the ceremony . 
One of his friends smirked : " It 's not <MONEY>$ 500</MONEY> yet ? 
" A 21-year-old double-major wearing a wrinkled blue button-down under his blackgown defended this scene as he drank a mimosa from a plastic cup . 
Soon his otherhand was filled with a cheap shot of vodka , bringing him to at least half adozen drinks in less than two hours - not that he was counting . 
" All of us have jobs . 
All of us have real majors . 
None of us got majors likepsychology , " he said . 
" This is out of character , even for us . 
We are getting itout of our systems now , and then we will go into the real world . 
" But , would his parents approve of him stumbling through this symbolic day ? 
" I told my parents what I was doing , and they were like , ' YOLO , ' " he said witha laugh . 
He paused before seriously requesting that his name and identifyingcharacteristics not appear in any article a future employer might read . 
" YOLO " - you only live once - is often uttered by college students as they shrugand do something they normally would n't do , such as drinking until they blackout , experimenting with drugs or trying a new sexual experience.This fall 's freshmen likely will find that the higher education tradition ofexcessive alcohol consumption is alive and well , but there are new variables : Energy drink mixers keep students awake and drinking longer . 
A historically highnumber of students legally take prescribed antidepressants and other psychiatricdrugs , which can be dangerous when mixed with booze.Today 's college students , who were mostly born in the early <DATE>1990s</DATE> , havecellphone cameras and social media accounts that allow for the sharing of everyembarrassing turn of a disastrous night . 
That can lead to a painful tarnishingof reputations or the celebration of reckless behavior . 
And news of the latestdrinking trends spreads quickly on the Web . 
Those trends have coloredperceptions of college students , but are they that much wilder than theirparents were?The scholarly standard for " too much " was long ago set at five drinks or more atleast once in a two-week period . 
For three decades , that national binge drinkingrate has hovered around 40 percent.But college officials - the ones tasked with making sure students do n't hurtthemselves or others - are n't necessarily worried about the bulk of thosestudents . 
They are concerned about the students who go out every night of theweek or have dozens of drinks each month , those who occasionally drink heavily , but with a lower tolerance . 
They worry about the black-out drunks . 
The violentdrunks . 
Those who turn to alcohol and drugs instead of seeking counseling.Alcohol is a common theme in nearly all student problems , including falteringgrades , fights , injuries , suicide attempts , mental-health issues and sexualassaults . 
A serious drinking problem could go undiagnosed for years in anenvironment where heavy drinking is considered the norm . 
These students face amore difficult path to graduation , as they are more likely to skip class , get introuble or not study . 
And if they do graduate , the transition to a working worldwith set hours can be difficult . 
" A lot of students do grow out of it , " said <PERSON>Susan Bruce</PERSON> , director of the <ORGANIZATION>U-Va</ORGANIZATION> . 
Center for Alcohol and <ORGANIZATION>Substance Education</ORGANIZATION> , " but there 's really no way topredict which ones will and which ones wo n't . 
" U-Va . 
has tracked student drinking rates since the <DATE>1960s</DATE> . 
The heaviest drinkingwas back in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> and <DATE>'80s</DATE> , when parents of today 's students would have beenenrolled , <PERSON>Bruce</PERSON> said . 
The rate is now in line with national averages.U-Va . 
has seen subtle growth at the two poles : students who do n't or hardlydrink , and those who are extreme drinkers . 
This trend is playing out at otheruniversities , prompting a shift in educational messaging.Colleges have been under pressure to keep students safe since the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> , when the national drinking age was increased to 21 , making it illegal for halfof the undergraduate population to drink . 
Many schools shut down campus pubs andforbid alcohol in dorms and sorority and fraternity houses.Lawsuits and deaths pushed some schools to crack down . 
Students are nowroutinely patrolled , busted and punished by local police , campus police , " partypatrol " crews that roam student neighborhoods , school judicial boards and evenparents , who at a growing number of schools are now contacted when their childhas any alcohol infraction . 
As a result , parties moved off campus.In <DATE>2008</DATE> , 130 college presidents voiced support for the Amethyst Initiative , which stated that a legal drinking age of 21 has created " a culture ofdangerous , clandestine ' binge-drinking ' - often conducted off-campus . 
" In recent years , some administrators have adopted this attitude : If students aregoing to drink , let them do it safely . 
More schools have amnesty policies forstudents who seek help for a friend who might have alcohol poisoning . 
Someschools have reopened campus pubs , serve wine in the dining halls or allowover-21 students to drink in on-campus apartments.At U-Va. , it has been difficult for several waves of administrators to chip awayat drinking traditions . 
At the annual Foxfield horse races , students startdrinking in the morning and go all day . 
At the historic Lawn , students getbombed , strip and streak naked . 
And there 's the " fourth-year fifth , " when somefourth-year students try to finish a fifth before kickoff at the final homefootball game . 
In <DATE>1997</DATE> , a senior honors student died after drinking heavily andfalling down stairs . 
" This is a very dangerous decision , " <DATE>U-Va</DATE> . 
President <PERSON>Teresa Sullivan</PERSON> wrote in aletter to students . 
" A fifth of 80-proof liquor ( 17 drinks ) can kill you . 
" U-Va . 
alcohol educators have suggested ways to make the tradition safer , such assplitting a bottle between friends , subbing in wine or spreading the drinkingacross a weekend . 
But the tradition continues.It does n't help that <DATE>U-Va</DATE> . 
is frequently named one of the top party schools inthe nation . 
Incoming students arrive with the notion that everyone drinksheavily , and some older students feel a responsibility to keep the reputationgoing.At a formal awards ceremony during graduation weekend , a top senior leader gavethis shout-out : " Thank you , <LOCATION>Forbes</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> , Buzzfeed , Playboy and the otherpublications that spotlighted our school 's achievements in your rankings . " 
Hewas interrupted by laughter and applause , then continued : " You reassured us thatwe 're the best school in the world . 
" The cozy first floor of the modular house was jammed with undergraduates , atleast 100 at any one time , dramatically upping the indoor temperature from thecrisp night outside , where a dozen smokers chose to hang out . 
The couch wascovered with coats and sweatshirts . 
Pop and house music blared.A feisty young woman guarded the door and interrogated every person who tried toenter . 
She let in close friends , sorta-friends , fellow seniors and youngerstudents who were in a religious retreat group one of her roommates led . 
" We decided to go big , " explained another one of the hostesses , wearing a blackspaghetti-strap top with her cellphone tucked into her cleavage.In one corner , seniors sipped Natty Light and talked about what they wanted todo before graduation . 
A couple of women tried to get everyone dancing . 
One guyalternated swigs of orange soda and vodka . 
A communal bottle of <ORGANIZATION>Wild Turkey</ORGANIZATION> madeits way through the horde.Most of the crowd was " binge drinking , " but mostly on light beer and overhours . 
They would go to sleep - not pass out - get up the next morning and goabout working and studying . 
But a couple of guys appeared bombed , including astumbling senior who gave a lengthy interview to a reporter , then e-mailed thenext afternoon . 
" I was speaking with you <TIME>last night</TIME> , and I have no recollectionof it whatsoever , " he wrote.One woman did n't drink at all . 
She never does , as alcohol has hurt her family.This party could be on any campus . 
On that <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in <DATE>April</DATE> , it was atBoston College , a Jesuit school that allows of-age seniors to host parties onFriday and <DATE>Saturday</DATE> nights in their on-campus modular houses ( known as " TheMods " ) , which went up in the '70s as temporary housing for baby boomers.The seniors must register parties and create a plan for what kind of alcoholthey will serve , along with nonalcoholic beverages and food . 
Hosts must agreenot to serve underage students , but younger students often sneak in , severalstudents said . 
And it 's not as if the dorms are lacking alcohol , despite strictrules against it.Like many schools , <ORGANIZATION>Boston College</ORGANIZATION> has upped the alcohol education it offersstudents , along with limiting access to alcohol , focusing attention on students ' making healthy decisions , offering alcohol-free events and packing students ' schedules . 
" If they 're under 21 , it 's always a risky choice to make , because there areconsequences . 
But if that 's a choice they are going to make , we want to givethem some tools for doing it safely , " said <PERSON>Robyn Priest</PERSON> , associate director ofBC 's office of health promotion.Even if students find alcohol ed tedious or boring , the message usually sticks.And those messages are reiterated over time.Outside the Mods that <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> , Chestnut Hill swarmed with studentssearching for alcohol or stumbling home from having had too much . 
Cabs hoverednear the entrance . 
The sound of women shouting " woooooo ! " 
floated from an opendorm window.A pack of guys poured out of one of the sophomore halls . 
One was franticallytexting , as his friend impatiently asked : " Do you know of a party ? " 
Anotherclarified : " Do you know of even a hint of a party ? 
" Inside Mod 15A , the party continued . 
" See how it 's really hot and super crowded ? 
That 's a Mod party , " said a seniorin jeans and a T-shirt . 
And this crowd is nothing , he explained , yelling andcracking open a beer . 
The previous weekend another group of women hosted a partyin their Mod that attracted so many people , who danced so hard , that the floorsagged and needed repair.These students said they do n't think their drinking is any heavier or lighterthan that at other colleges . 
Students drink - sometimes too much - but it 's nota big deal , they said . 
" It 's work hard , play hard , " said a 22-year-old senior . 
" I 've had marathon weekswith seven nights straight , and I 've had weeks where I drink one night . 
" Just after <TIME>1 a.m.</TIME> , the music cut out . 
" Sorry , guys , " one of the hosts yelled , " party is over . 
" Some students chug the rest of their drinks ; others take them for the walk home.There 's a debate over whether they could get to the local dive bar before lastcall . 
Many students make their way - some swaying , arms around each other - to adining hall that serves greasy late-night food , a service schools have begun tooffer to get sustenance in the stomachs of imbibing students.The students who threw the party begin picking up beer cans , putting furnitureback into place - and de-tagging unflattering photos on Facebook.Within 30 minutes of new-student orientation kicking off at <ORGANIZATION>Frostburg StateUniversity</ORGANIZATION> on a <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> in <DATE>June</DATE> , the school 's top leader had themicrophone and was talking about alcohol . 
He warned the group sitting before him - mostly 18-year-olds with their parents - not to get caught up in the " collegeeffect , " the idea presented in movies and on sitcoms that going to college meansdrinking . 
" Beyond the tragedies , what concerns me most is the loss of human potential , " said President <PERSON>Jonathan C. Gibralter</PERSON> , who has led the public university inWestern <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> since <DATE>2006</DATE> . 
He paused before continuing : " Please think aboutthat this <DATE>summer</DATE> . 
Do n't let yourselves get caught up in that world of excessive,high-risk drinking and change the story of what is possible for you at <ORGANIZATION>FrostburgState University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" <LOCATION>Frostburg</LOCATION> used to be a major party school , a reputation coupled with tragedy . 
Afreshman died of alcohol poisoning in <DATE>1996</DATE> after drinking at an unaffiliatedfraternity 's party . 
Seven students were charged . 
Early in <LOCATION>Gibralter</LOCATION> ' spresidency , a student punched a neighbor outside a frat party , nearly killingthe man . 
And over the years , several students have been hospitalized afterdrinking too much.Gibralter is convinced that administrators can change the drinking culture - andthat they must . 
" There 's this impression that there 's nothing you can do aboutit , and that 's just wrong , " he said.Gibralter wants to change the " college effect . " 
In high school , college-boundstudents are less likely to drink than students who do n't plan to continue theireducation . 
But during freshman year , students who already drink start to drinkmore , and students who never drank are likely to start . 
The drinking rates ofthose people in college are much higher than those not enrolled.Gibralter 's wife is an alcohol educator , and he has been closely involved withnational initiatives , including one recently launched by <ORGANIZATION>Dartmouth College</ORGANIZATION> thattreats college drinking as a public health epidemic.Gibralter has made reducing high-risk drinking a priority at <LOCATION>Frostburg</LOCATION> . 
He ' sconfident the university is making strides , as the percentage of students whobinge-drink fell from <PERCENT>54 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>2006</DATE> to <PERCENT>41 percent</PERCENT> <DATE>last year</DATE> . 
With thatcomes academic achievements : a slowly increasing retention rate , incomingstudents with higher academic credentials and fewer discipline problems.Frostburg has worked to create an environment where there are many more thingsto do than drink . 
The business school now offers a full slate of <DATE>Friday</DATE> classesto discourage Thursday-night drinking . 
And the university often hostsalcohol-free dance parties that attract hundreds.The university gave money to the local police force for an extra officer topatrol student neighborhoods on popular party nights . 
Once a month , Frostburgofficials meet with police and representatives from bars and liquor stores . 
Theschool will pay for employee training and have students design the bars ' menusin exchange for closely following the law , limiting drink specials and promotinghealthy drinking habits.All incoming students are required to pass an online class that teaches thatmost college students do n't drink like characters in the movies . 
Officials urgeparents to talk with their children about drinking before move-in day . 
Thateducation continues into the fall and is often led by students . 
Student leaders , including those of fraternities and sororities , are required to receive the sametraining bartenders receive so they can spot problems at parties.Frostburg maintains zero tolerance for underage drinking . 
A first offenseresults in more alcohol education and a letter to parents , which schoolofficials say has lessened the number of further , more serious offenses.During orientation , dean of students <PERSON>Jesse M. Ketterman Jr.</PERSON> sternly warned : " Wedeal with behavior on and off campus . 
It does n't matter if you do it on campusor off ; we will find out about it . 
" But , sure enough , during every orientation , at least a few incoming freshmen askolder students to buy them beer or recommend parties . 
" The people who ask about alcohol at [ orientation ] are n't going to be here in ayear , " said <PERSON>Andy Krehbiel</PERSON> , a rising senior and fraternity member who works inthe student center.The cultural changes have not been easy or popular , <LOCATION>Gibralter</LOCATION> said . 
Even so , there are still tragedies , including one student fatally stabbed by another atan off-campus party in <DATE>2011</DATE> . 
" We 're only as good as our <DATE>last weekend</DATE> , " <LOCATION>Gibralter</LOCATION> said . 
" I never go to bed atnight thinking : ' Thank goodness . 
We finally solved this problem . ' 
" The video starts with the sound of a marching band and quickly cuts to twosupposed <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> undergrads standing on a balcony in <LOCATION>Ann Arbor</LOCATION> insunglasses . 
" Hey , guys , I 'm Liza , " says the young woman wearing jeans shorts and a MichiganT-shirt , cropped to show her toned abs . 
A guy in a black tank top and backwardcap next to her introduces himself as <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> . 
" Welcome to Welcome Week <DATE>2012</DATE> , " she says . 
" We 're going to show you how we work hard , " <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> explains . 
" And play harder , " <PERSON>Liza says.As Wiz Khalifa</PERSON> 's song " Work Hard , Play Hard " pulses , the screen fills withphotos that look as if they belong in an admissions brochure : the <LOCATION>Michiganstadium</LOCATION> , the bell tower , ivy-covered buildings and a banner exclaiming , " Welcometo <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> !! 
" The refrain hits - Work ! 
Work ! 
Work ! 
Work ! 
- and the screen turns into a montageof party scenes . 
A massive house party . 
A guy wearing a glow necklacebrandishing two bottles of hard liquor . 
Students toasting a shot to the bestweek of their lives . 
Women shaking it . 
Every few seconds , someone shouts anexpletive.As the lyrics become even more unpublishable , the footage gets wilder . 
Studentsdancing in a shower of hose water . 
Guys standing on a balcony and pouring astream of alcohol into the open mouth of a guy below . 
Marijuana . 
Stacks of cash.Kissing . 
Fighting . 
Dancing . 
Chugging . 
Shotgunning . 
Funneling . 
And more dancing.This is an " I 'm Shmacked " video , the creation of two 20-somethings who launcheda production company in college . 
Shmacked , according to <ORGANIZATION>Urban Dictionary</ORGANIZATION> , means " to become intoxicated to the point of not even being able to stand up , knowwhat 's going on , or correctly pronounce any word . 
" The team travels from school to school , often at the request of students , andrecords the most outrageous scenes it can find ( with this disclaimer : " Noalcohol or illegal substance is used during the filming , just prop " ) . 
The videosget millions of page views and help to define today 's college drinking culture.It 's not the image that most universities want these days , especially as theypump thousands of dollars into alcohol education and branding efforts focused onacademics , not keg stands . 
" It is important to emphasize that it paints a picture of only a small portionof our student population , " said <PERSON>Kelly Cunningham</PERSON> , a <ORGANIZATION>University of Michiganspokeswoman</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We have many students at UM who choose not to drink , or when theychoose to drink , drink moderately . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> graduates had to line up for the ceremony at <TIME>9:30 a.m</TIME> . 
In the final minutes , they finished off their drinks and closed out theirtabs.On the porch of a fraternity house , three guys popped open champagne , then racedto finish first . 
The Vitamin C song " Graduation " blared : Can we survive it out there?Can we make it somehow?I guess I thought that thiswould never end . 
And suddenlyit 's like we 're women and men.Will the past be a shadow thatwill follow us around?Will these memories fadewhen I leave this town?Around the university 's most historic building , the <LOCATION>Rotunda</LOCATION> , thousands ofgraduates lined up in matching robes and caps . 
" I 'm scared ! " 
one guydramatically said as he dragged himself toward the ceremony . 
Most walkedconfidently . 
A few pinballed . 
A couple slipped on the wet grass.The ceremony began . 
Speakers shared inspirational thoughts . 
A business studentsipped an oversize can of Bud Light . 
An engineering student sprinted out of thecrowd , looking ill . 
Everyone sang the school song.They moved their tassels . 
And then they marched into the real world.Jenna <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> is a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post staff writer .
