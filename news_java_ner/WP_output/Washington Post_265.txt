Notre Dame is back.There 's simply no arguing with the fact that the Fighting Irish , who are 6-0 , are in the national championship picture.For those who loved the movie " Rudy , " and get chills every time they hear theNotre Dame fight song , this is welcome news after 18 seasons of mostly mediocrefootball . 
In his third season as coach , <PERSON>Brian Kelly</PERSON> is rapidly becoming an iconat the school.Long forgotten is his decision two autumns ago to practice outdoors ingale-force winds two days after an embarrassing loss to <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> , a decision thatled to team manager <PERSON>Declan Sullivan</PERSON> being on a video tower when a gust of windblew the tower down and killed him . 
Also apparently forgotten is schoolPresident <PERSON>John Jenkins</PERSON> 's refusal to meet with the family of a young woman whocommitted suicide shortly after filing a sexual assault complaint against aNotre Dame football player.Father <PERSON>Jenkins</PERSON> refused to meet with the family because his lawyer advised himnot to do so . 
Apparently comforting the afflicted only applies at <LOCATION>Notre Dameupon</LOCATION> the advice of counsel.Now , it is as if those awful moments never happened . 
It is all good at <ORGANIZATION>NotreDame</ORGANIZATION> right now . 
The Irish , led by a superb defense that includes , arguably , thebest player in the country - senior linebacker Manti Te'o - have beaten more " name " teams than anyone ranked in the top 10 . 
They are ranked No. 5 in thefirst BCS rankings released <DATE>Sunday</DATE> night.The fact that <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> have turned out to be dudsis n't <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> 's fault . 
When they were scheduled , they looked like tough outs.Notre Dame gave up a total of 12 points to the three of them.The defense was just as good on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in a thrilling , though controversial,20-13 overtime win over <LOCATION>Stanford</LOCATION> . 
Once again , it did n't surrender a touchdown inregulation . 
The Cardinal 's only touchdown came when quarterback <PERSON>Everett Golsonfumbled</PERSON> in the end zone in <DATE>the second quarter</DATE> and <ORGANIZATION>Stanford recovered.Whether Stanford</ORGANIZATION> scored a touchdown in overtime is , at the very least , open todebate . 
After the Irish scored to take a 20-13 lead , <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> had firstand goalat the <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> 4-yard line . 
Four times running back <PERSON>Stepfan Taylor</PERSON> tried toget into the end zone and four times - according to the officials - he came upshort.Exactly why <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> did n't change up the play-calling against a defense thathas given up three touchdowns in six games is a legitimate question to raise.That said , it appeared to most people that <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> scored on second effort on thefourth-down play . 
The officials on the field ruled that he did n't score , andreplay officials upheld the call even though it looked as if <PERSON>Taylor</PERSON> 's forwardprogress was never completely stopped before he spun and dove into the end zone.And so everyone at <LOCATION>Notre Dame</LOCATION> is all smiles right now . 
The Irish have two toughgames left on their schedule : at <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> in two weeks and at <ORGANIZATION>SouthernCalifornia</ORGANIZATION> to close out the season.The other four games are virtual walkovers for a good team : <ORGANIZATION>Brigham Young</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Boston College</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> and Wake Forest . 
The latter three , who have combinedto win three games this season against <ORGANIZATION>Football Bowl Subdivision</ORGANIZATION> opponents , willgive the Irish a taste of what they can expect when they start playing five ACCopponents a couple of years from now . 
It will , no doubt , be a very sweet taste.What 's more , the two more difficult games hardly look impossible . 
Oklahoma haslost to <ORGANIZATION>Kansas State and Southern California</ORGANIZATION> has lost to <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> and has hardlylooked overwhelming most weeks in spite of all its preseason hype . 
Bet this : <ORGANIZATION>IfNotre Dame</ORGANIZATION> wins out , it will play in the BCS title game even if <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Oregonand Kansas State</ORGANIZATION> also are undefeated.Less likely to happen but not out of the question is Te'o winning the HeismanTrophy . 
Pure defensive players do n't win the Heisman ( remember <PERSON>Charles Woodsonplayed</PERSON> on offense and special teams when he won in <DATE>1997</DATE> ) but Te'o has a shot , inpart because the most likely candidates on offense keep tripping overthemselves . 
USC 's <PERSON>Matt Barkley</PERSON> was practically handed the award in <DATE>September</DATE> , but did n't play well against <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> and has n't been brilliant since then . 
Intothat void stepped <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> 's <PERSON>Geno Smith</PERSON> , until he and his team wereembarrassed on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Tech.Oregon 's De'Anthony Thomas is spectacular but teammate <PERSON>Kenjon Barner</PERSON> seems toget the ball a lot more . 
<ORGANIZATION>Kansas State</ORGANIZATION> 's <PERSON>Collin Klein</PERSON> is extremely solid , but ishe spectacular enough to win the Heisman?Te ' o is a wonderful player , a terrific kid and he plays for an undefeated NotreDame team that is built around him and its defense . 
Miracles happen at <ORGANIZATION>NotreDame</ORGANIZATION> , right ? 
Just ask <DATE>Saturday</DATE> 's replay officials.ElsewhereIn case you had n't noticed - and you probably have n't - the <ORGANIZATION>Big East</ORGANIZATION> has threeundefeated teams : <LOCATION>Louisville</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Cincinnati</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Rutgers</ORGANIZATION> . 
Of course their wins onSaturday were over <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Fordham</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Syracuse</LOCATION> , respectively , so that mightexplain why no one has noticed.Savannah State update : The Tigers , who opened their season by being outscored,139-0 , by <ORGANIZATION>Oklahoma State</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Florida State</ORGANIZATION> because school administrators thoughtnothing of letting their players get beaten up in order to cash two guaranteechecks , are now 0-6 and have been outscored , 190-51 , since the first two games . 
. . . Surprise team of the season to date : <ORGANIZATION>Oregon State</ORGANIZATION> is 5-0 after beating BYU,42-24 , on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> . 
The Beavers were 3-9 a year ago and were n't expected to betoo much better than that this season.They play <LOCATION>Utah</LOCATION> next <DATE>Saturday</DATE> . 
After that they still have to play at <LOCATION>Washingtonand</LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION>Stanford</ORGANIZATION> before closing the season at home against Oregon.For more by the author , visit his blog at www.feinsteinonthebrink.com .
