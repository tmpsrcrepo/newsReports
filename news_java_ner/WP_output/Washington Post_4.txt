" Right now , nearly one in five women in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has been a victim of rape orattempted rape . " 
- President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> , in a video that aired during the GrammyAwards , <DATE>Feb. 8</DATE> , 2015A number of readers have questioned this statistic asserted by President <PERSON>Obamain</PERSON> a public service announcement that is part of the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> campaign to endsexual assaults on college campuses . 
It 's a different statistic from one we havepreviously examined - that one out of five women will be sexually assaultedwhile in college - though confusingly , it involves a similar " one in five " number.However , this figure is not about incidents during four years of college , butover a lifetime . 
So , what 's the story on this statistic?The FactsThe statistic comes from one of several large surveys that have been conductedabout sexual violence in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> . 
Rape is widely believed to be anunderreported crime , because of the stigma involved and the self-doubt ofvictims who may blame themselves . 
So researchers , mainly on behalf of thefederal government , have sought to reveal the actual rape statistics throughconfidential surveys.But there have been vast differences in the results , in part because there aretwo different kinds of surveys : criminal justice and public health . 
The criminaljustice approach seeks to identify an event ( such as an assault ) , determine whenit occurred and learn as much about it as possible . 
The public health approachlooks more at behaviors and seeks to stimulate memories , but it is lessinterested in legal definitions.So a criminal justice approach might ask specifically whether someone was raped , but the public health approach would not ask that question directly , believingthat rape victims are reluctant to identify themselves ( or may not even realizethat the act in question was a rape ) . 
The hope is that questions about behaviorswill increase disclosure and capture various types of unwanted sexualpenetration . 
But it also means the analysts - not the respondent - determinewhether the situation merits the label of rape.The survey that formed the basis of <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's statement - the <DATE>2011</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>NationalIntimate Partner</ORGANIZATION> and Sexual Violence Survey ( NISVS ) , released by the <ORGANIZATION>Centers forDisease Control and Prevention</ORGANIZATION> - was a public-health study . 
It estimated that1 .9 million American women were raped in the preceding 12-month period . 
In fact , the survey said that more than 23 million women ( <PERCENT>19.3 percent</PERCENT> ) were raped duringtheir lifetime . 
( The survey 's definition of rape included completed , attemptedand " alcohol - or drug-facilitated penetration . " ) 
But the <ORGANIZATION>National Crime Victimization Survey</ORGANIZATION> ( NCVS ) , run by the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of JusticeStatistics</ORGANIZATION> , estimated that there were 174,000 victims of rapes and sexualassaults in <DATE>2012</DATE> ( and nearly 350,000 total rapes ) . 
In other words , <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> cited a government study that came up with a number ofwomen raped or sexually assaulted that was at least five times higher thananother government survey.However , <ORGANIZATION>the Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> survey has long been criticized as an inadequatemeasure of rape . 
A <ORGANIZATION>National Research Council</ORGANIZATION> report in <DATE>2014</DATE> offeredrecommendations on how to improve it , saying it was " highly likely " it wasunderestimating the number of rapes . 
While the <ORGANIZATION>NRC</ORGANIZATION> report made no judgment onthe <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> survey - since that was not part of its mandate - the panel noted howmuch higher the numbers were in the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> report : " This differential between theNISVS and the other surveys is surprising . 
" Both surveys were drawn from many interviews . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> survey wasbased on interviews with more than 143,000 people , with a response rate of 88percent . 
The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> study was based on interviews with more than 14,000 people , with a response rate of 33 <ORGANIZATION>percent.The Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> survey is a classic example of a criminal justiceapproach . 
It asked how someone was attacked ; if rape was mentioned , the surveyasked a series of questions about the incident . 
By reference , the actual numberof reported forcible rapes and attempted rapes was fewer than 85,000 in <DATE>2012</DATE> . 
Soeven under this approach , researchers uncovered far more rapes than arereported.The questions in the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> survey are much more open-ended , never using terms suchas " rape " or " sexual assault . " 
For instance , one section asked " when you weredrunk , high , drugged , or passed out and unable to consent , how many people haveever â [ #x 20ac ] ¦ [ series of statements describing various sex acts ] . 
" This question is interesting because the operative element is whether someone isunable to consent to sex . 
But given the wording , is it possible for a listenerto misinterpret it as a question about whether they had sex while drunk or high?The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> thinks not . 
" We have gone to great lengths to ensure that respondents understand these twocomponents - the use of substances and the inability to give consent - as partof the administration of these questions , " said <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Courtney Lenard</PERSON> . 
" A scenario of consensual sex after drinking at a party , for instance , would notmeet the definition of what is included in this series of NISVS questions . 
" Still , it turns out that almost <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> of the rapes reported by the surveydepend on this drunk/high/lack of consent section . 
More than <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> of thewomen - which adds up to an estimated 11.2 million people - were classified asrape victims as a result of this question . 
Lack of consent after alcohol abuseis certainly an important issue , one that college campuses are grappling with.But the figure cited by <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> depends on the outcome of this section of thesurvey.Digging into the report , one also finds interesting oddities.For instance , a form of " sexual violence " is men reporting that they were " madeto penetrate " someone else . 
Over the preceding 12 months , the survey estimated1 .9 million men were made to have sex with someone else against their will - virtually the same number of women who were the victims of rape . 
( The <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> ' sLenard said the " made to penetrate " category is a relatively new category thatis still not fully understood . ) 
A <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said : " In his comment , the president says nearly one infive women have been the victim of rape or attempted rape . 
When you combine thetwo instances - rape and attempted rape - the publicly available data from theCenters for <ORGANIZATION>Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> affirms that statement . 
" The Pinocchio TestTo be technical about it , the " rape " category of the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> report consisted ofrape , attempted rape and " alcohol - or drug-facilitated penetration ; " one doesnot quite get to the one in five statistic without the third category . 
But bythe same token , under the <ORGANIZATION>CDC</ORGANIZATION> 's definitions , the president could have simplysaid " rape " and still have correctly cited the report.But in this case , the president did not cite the report ; he stated it as anactual fact . 
Granted , he was speaking in a public service announcement , wherefootnotes and caveats are generally not used . 
If he was trying to get people ' sattention , he certainly did . 
But by the same token , by citing as fact theresults of a survey that may be overstated , the president runs the risk ofundermining support for his efforts to call attention to sexual violence.There 's no such thing as a perfect survey , with completely accurate results - especially when the conclusions are determined by the interpretations ofanalysts . 
So the president earns a Pinocchio.For previous columns , go to washingtonpost.com/factchecker .
