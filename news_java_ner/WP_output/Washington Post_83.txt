If this is the new , muscular <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> , let me be the first to say I like it . 
And Ihope this wo n't be the last time we see the organization many - including me - had all but given up on for having barely a bark and a nearly toothless biteflex its collective biceps and deliver a knockout blow.That 's certainly what happened to <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> on Mondaywhen the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> meted outsanctions that arguably have as much bite as what many feared : the <ORGANIZATION>deathpenalty.Penn State</ORGANIZATION> - for allowing its football program to run roughshod over its commonsense , the law and finally basic human decency - will lose 20 scholarships andbe banned from postseason play for four years . 
It will be fined <MONEY>$ 60 million</MONEY> , which will be used to establish an endowment to help the victims of child sexualabuse around the country ( not just the victims of <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky</PERSON> , who are stillfree to sue the school ) . 
It set up an ethical oversight board and reserved theright to further punish anyone involved with the program once the dust settlesfrom the current charges.And perhaps most surprising , it vacated all of the <ORGANIZATION>Nittany Lions</ORGANIZATION> ' victories from1998 to <DATE>2011</DATE> . 
If the school had n't removed <PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> 's statue <DATE>Sunday</DATE> , it mighthave fallen over from shock.The sanctions are tough , but what is really striking is that they were handeddown by <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Mark Emmert</PERSON> without a prior hearing by the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> onInfractions - because <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> has n't broken NCAA rules.I 'm as critical as anyone of the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> - I was convinced they would n't takedecisive action , and I was wrong - but it 's hard to fault them for not havinganticipated the need for rules such as : " A coach shall not use his position tolure children to the school and assault them " or " A coach shall not use hispower to cover up the sexual abuse of children by anyone in his employ . 
" That kind of thing usually falls under " common sense " for most of us - butapparently not for all . 
So <PERSON>Emmert</PERSON> took the unprecedented step of wielding whatsome might call autocratic authority . 
There 's a kind of poetic justice in that.Now comes the time to hear that the sanctions are n't fair to the currentplayers . 
Of course they are n't . 
Sanctions seldom punish the people who causedthe fracas . 
<ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> got slapped , but <PERSON>Jim Tressel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Terrelle Pryor</PERSON> were n'taround to feel the sting . 
This is not the last time life will be unfair to thesekids , sadly . 
But they can transfer to other schools and play immediately , orstay at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> and play , or stay at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> on full scholarship and electnot to play . 
In other words , they have choices , something <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> 's victimsquite palpably did not have.The community will also suffer . 
But the deification of the <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> footballprogram was not limited to campus . 
The results were far-reaching . 
The birthmother of <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> 's adopted son <PERSON>Matt</PERSON> was one of the people who sensed somethingwas wrong with <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> . 
But she was n't an important member of the community , not compared to an assistant coach at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> . 
He was automatically believedand trusted because he wore a whistle around his neck . 
How sad is that?Even the staunchest <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> alumni have been rocked by trial testimony and bythe revelations of the 162-page Freeh report released <DATE>July 12</DATE> . 
In it are e-mailsthat make plain that university officials were aware of <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> 's actions andlooked the other way . 
And that includes <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> . 
<ORGANIZATION>Penn State 's Board of Trusteeshired</ORGANIZATION> former <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>Louis Freeh</PERSON> to compile the report , and the schoolannounced it accepted the findings . 
But the school failed to do anything topunish , curtail or in any way diminish the football program , despite the factthat the football program and the reverence with which it was treated created anicon so powerful that a statue was erected to him long before his death inJanuary.That program eventually was seen as untouchable , so much so that when <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> ' shorrible actions were made known to people at the highest levels of theuniversity , instead of taking action , they consulted Paterno.Why ? 
In what way should <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> have had any say in what was a criminal matter?Paterno , too , did nothing . 
Former athletic director <PERSON>Tim Curley</PERSON> and retired vicepresident <PERSON>Gary Schultz</PERSON> have been charged with perjury for lying to the grandjury investigating charges against <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> . 
Former president <PERSON>Graham Spanier</PERSON> hasnot been charged with anything , for whatever reason.Paterno defenders will haul out the tired argument that he is not as much toblame as others in the case . 
The problem is this : There is no scale to measuresuch blame . 
He knew . 
He did nothing . 
Oh , I 'm sorry , he told <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> not toshower with young boys any more . 
The attempt to make <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> a victim in thisdreadful scandal is becoming tiresome . 
He is not a victim . 
The victims were thechildren . 
Period . 
End of story . 
That clearly was the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> 's thought in vacatingall those victories.The statue was the 900-pound elephant in the room , and it was n't helped by thefact that behind it were inscriptions that called <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> a " humanitarian " - eerily echoing the idea expressed in the Freeh report that <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> needed to betreated humanely even after it was known that he was a pedophile - and a quotefrom <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> that in part said " I hope they write I made <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> a betterplace . . . " How could the school leave the statue in place with those wordsbehind it?But the statue is a red herring on this day . 
The issue is the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> 's newfoundmuscle , and the mark it has left on <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> - and truthfully , there willnever be another situation like this , so perhaps there will never be a needagain for this much muscle . 
But if the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> would handle all violations withstrong sanctions , tough language and an understanding that the public at largeis losing faith in a sport with a lot of warts , then maybe it can be redeemedalong with <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> .
