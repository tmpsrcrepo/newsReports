American Catholics are famously indifferent to the directives of their leaders.They do n't follow the rule book on much of anything : birth control , legalabortion , premarital sex , divorce.They wish , by a wide margin , that their bishops were talking more about socialjustice issues such as poverty and less about culture-war issues such asabortion . 
When asked what matters to them most about being Catholic , theyoverwhelmingly say the resurrection of Jesus , not <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> authority or celibate , male priests.And aside from those who are paid to do so , very few American commentators canrally much enthusiasm for the imminent conclave in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> and the usualhandicapping of the papabile . 
" New Pope ? 
I 've Given Up Hope , " wrote the historian <PERSON>Garry Wills</PERSON> , perhapsAmerica 's most eviscerating disillusioned Catholic . 
It 's as if Catholic identityhas become entirely disconnected from the institutional church . 
" I 'm Catholic , " a friend of mine explained to me . 
" I just do n't agree with anything the churchsays . 
" During this historical caesura , when one pope has exited the stage and anotherhas yet to enter , why not then ask the obvious , blasphemous question ? 
Whatdistinguishes these Christians , skeptical of authority and seeking meaning intheir own interpretations of the gospel message , from their brothers and sisterswho wholly reject the power of the pope ? 
Bluntly put : Why are these Catholicsdifferent from Protestants?Over the past weeks , Roman Catholic intellectuals and pontificators have beenusing words like " schism " and " reform " to describe the current moment . 
Will anew pope , whoever he is , have the strength and savvy to hold together a churchthat is , in the words of a British Vatican correspondent , " imploding " and " crumbling " ? 
The papal biographer <PERSON>George Weigel</PERSON> has been talking and writing about the needto " reform " the corrupt bureaucracy of the <LOCATION>Curia</LOCATION> , beginning , as he said in aninterview in the <ORGANIZATION>National Review</ORGANIZATION> , with " a change in attitude , not merely achange of structures . " 
In the <ORGANIZATION>Huffington Post</ORGANIZATION> , the leftist theologian <PERSON>Hans Kungpredicts</PERSON> " many conflicts " between two living popes.In these and other comments there is a foreboding comparison to the events ofthe <DATE>16th century</DATE> , which split the Christian West in two . 
After the ProtestantReformation , there were those who continued to believe in the authority of thepope and his men . 
And there were those who did not.The root of the word Protestant is , of course , " protest . " 
It was given to <ORGANIZATION>MartinLuther</ORGANIZATION> 's movement in <DATE>1529</DATE> , at a moment when <PERSON>Luther</PERSON> and his allies were declaringtheir opposition to the Holy Roman Emperor <PERSON>Charles V. Luther</PERSON> was moved to hisprotest , of course , by what he saw as widespread corruption in the church.In <DATE>1517</DATE> , in order to finish the construction of St. <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> 's <LOCATION>Basilica</LOCATION> , the churchbegan selling the faithful first-class tickets to heaven : A contribution , theywere told , would get them an " indulgence , " an official document that , accordingto one of the church 's salesmen , would buy " a divine and immortal soul . 
" The offenses committed by the institutional church were different 500 years agothan they are today : This was not the sexual abuse of innocents . 
But the root ofthe outrage is the same . 
The beloved institution has betrayed the faithful bytaking advantage of their innocence and trust . 
The betrayal is deepened by theleaders ' insistence on their own authority and power . 
Luther 's reforms ( andCalvin 's ) led to a more unmediated Christianity , where what really mattered wasnot the Christian corporation but the individual 's relationship with God.The church and the faithful may agree they need another Reformation now , butrealities of the modern religious marketplace prevent it.Five hundred years ago , a disillusioned Catholic faced a brutal choice : Hedenied his church on penalty of torture or death . 
Now , he can just slip away . 
Hemight be just as happy to be Protestant , finding comfort and familiarity amongthe Episcopalians , who have made recruiting lapsed Catholics a priority . 
Hemight find joy in the preaching of a non-denominational minister . 
He might findhimself among the " nones , " practicing yoga and reading spiritual books , unaffiliated with any church tradition . 
The nones are the fastest-growingreligious group in the country.Or a disaffected Catholic might stay in the church and tell herself that thechurch is not its leaders but the billion people in it . 
She might stay for loveof the Mass and the sacraments , the <ORGANIZATION>Hail Mary</ORGANIZATION> and the Our Father . 
She might staybecause she keeps her grandmother 's rosary in a desk drawer and fingers it whenone of her children is in trouble , or because she finds herself saying a prayerfor her parents in the middle of the night.Two-thirds of Catholics say they ca n't imagine being anything else , according toa <DATE>2011</DATE> survey , and an even higher number say that they value the Catholictradition of loyalty and dissent : loving the church while disagreeing with itsleadership . 
No matter who becomes pope , these Catholics would never say they ' reProtestant.For <PERSON>Lisa Miller</PERSON> 's previous columns , go to www.washingtonpost.com/onfaith .
