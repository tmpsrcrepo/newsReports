One of the enduring strategies for workers is the doctrine of no surprises : Makesure the boss knows what 's coming , whether it 's good news or bad , before shehears it via the office grapevine.Would that employers followed the same principle when talking about personnelmatters . 
Workers often can be caught off guard by workplace queries fromsuperiors and unprepared to respond intelligently . 
Being able to think quicklyand answer appropriately is a wonderful asset at the office , but sometimesemployers ' questions are inappropriate , perhaps even illegal.Consider a couple of recent questions from the workplace : Q : I am age 60 and have never discussed any plans for retirement with myemployer.Recently , while in a group of four co-workers , my immediate supervisor asked mewhen I was going to retire and told me he had to know . 
I responded vaguely.A couple of weeks later , in a phone conversation , the immediate supervisormentioned my retiring early and told me he had plans for me to show a newemployee around prior to my leaving . 
I again was noncommittal about the exacttiming of my retirement.Does he have the right to suggest that I retire early ? 
What advice can you giveme about handling retirement questions from him ? 
I honestly do n't know when Iwant to retire . 
He has not offered me a monetary incentive to retire before age65.A : The worker , a salesman for a manufacturing firm , said that when his bossfirst asked the retirement question he finessed his answer , joking , " It dependson what the buyout is . " 
He also said that he might retire in a couple years butwas n't sure.But the salesman said that when the boss called a couple weeks later , he " veryspecifically mentioned me being gone in 1 1/2 years . " 
" I did n't let my emotions get away , but I think this guy thinks he 's going tobuffalo me into quitting at 62 . 
I think they have a strategy that they can goout and get someone at half my salary , " the salesman said . 
" I just always figured retirement was someone 's personal choice . 
" In this case , the employee is right.For the most part there is no mandatory retirement age in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , although federal law does make some exceptions , such as allowing corporations toset 65 as the age that key decision-making executives have to retire andprohibiting commercial airline pilots from flying after 60 . 
Various courts have ruled that it is not illegal for employers to ask workersabout their retirement plans . 
But <PERSON>Raymond Fay</PERSON> , a <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> lawyer who has representedworkers and employers in age-discrimination cases , said that if a worker hasresponded that he has no immediate plans to quit and the employer repeatedlycontinues to inquire about his retirement plans , the questions then have crossedthe line into illegal age-discrimination harassment.Both <PERSON>Fay</PERSON> and <PERSON>Laurie McCann</PERSON> , a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION>AARP Foundation</ORGANIZATION> who representsseniors who allege that they have been discriminated against , said the salesman , assuming he indeed has not made definitive retirement plans , needs to tell hissuperior exactly that . 
" He ought to set the record straight in as diplomatic a way as possible , " Faysaid . 
" He needs to disabuse his superior of the notion that he 's going toleave . 
" <PERSON>McCann</PERSON> added : " I would try to put closure to this . 
If [ the worker ] says ' I do n'tknow , ' that gives the employer a chance to ask again . 
He needs to make apoint-blank statement : ' I 've thought about it , and I 'm not planning onretirement . ' 
" Then , <PERSON>McCann</PERSON> said , the worker ought to start keeping a journal of the variousretirement conversations , so that if the employer persists in making repeatedinquiries , he 'll have a record of it in case the questions cross the line intoharassment . 
" He needs to make a case that this is not on the up and up , " <PERSON>McCann</PERSON> said.Q : Can a potential employer during an interview ask a job applicant how often heis sick ? 
I had this question asked once during an interview with a federalgovernment agency.A : Those familiar with the federal hiring process said it would be highlyunusual for such a question to be asked.Victor <PERSON>M. Glasberg</PERSON> , a lawyer in <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION> who represents workers in employmentdisputes , was blunter , saying : " It 's at best imprudent , at worst illegal . 
" An employer has an absolute right to know that an employee can do the work , " <PERSON>Glasberg</PERSON> said . 
" But [ the question ] seems to be an illegal way to go about it . 
" He said <ORGANIZATION>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</ORGANIZATION> guidelines state that it ispermissible for employers to ask prospective workers if they can " do this jobwith or without reasonable accommodation , " to account for any disabilities theymight have . 
" But you do n't ask about the medical stuff , " <PERSON>Glasberg</PERSON> said , " but [ rather ] the capacity to do the work . 
" Once someone has been offered a job , <PERSON>Glasberg</PERSON> said , they can be required to takea pre-employment medical exam , but any medical abnormalities found in the examca n't be the basis for not employing the person unless " it can be shown on themerits why someone ca n't do the job " he has already been offered . 
" There has tobe a very strong reason to show why someone should n't be hired . 
" <PERSON>Glasberg</PERSON> said that rather than asking how often someone has been sick , anemployer might preferably ask a prospective worker , " Is there any reason tobelieve you wo n't be here to work ? " 
That , he said , might elicit informationabout past substantial illnesses or that a worker is pregnant or needs to travelout of town occasionally to care for an elderly parent . 
" Common sense and sensitivity are giant steps toward solving <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of legalproblems , " <PERSON>Glasberg</PERSON> said . 
" Thoughtlessness and insensitivity account for a wholelot more workplace disputes than outright malice .
