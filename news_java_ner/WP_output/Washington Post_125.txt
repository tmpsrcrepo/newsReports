How does a federal worker keep his or her agency out of the news ? 
One sure-fireway is to simply not do anything newsworthy.Too late on that front for <PERSON>Karen Kraushaar</PERSON> , the spokeswoman for the TreasuryDepartment 's inspector general , who accused http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/herman-cain-addresses-sharon-bialeks-charges-as-he-meets-the-press-in-arizona-on-tuesday/2011/11/08/gIQATeB01M_story.html?hpid=z1-URL-Herman <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> ofsexual harassment when both of them were working at thehttp : <ORGANIZATION>/ / www.restaurant.org/-URL-National Restaurant Association</ORGANIZATION> . 
So when <PERSON>Kraushaar</PERSON> was the keynote speaker at ahttp : / / www.nagconline.org/documents/NAGC2012Program.pdf-URL-conference forfederal communications officials on <DATE>Friday</DATE> , where she delivered a talk titled " Keeping Your Agency Out of the Story : Telling a Story No One Wants Told ( butEveryone Wants to Hear ) , " her strategy was simpler : just keep it off the record.Even though the rest of the conference , held by thehttp : <ORGANIZATION>/ / www.nagconline.org-URL-National Association for Government Communicators</ORGANIZATION> , was open to the news media ( though the rest of the panels and talks soundedway less interesting ) , we were informed when we showed up that <PERSON>Kraushaar</PERSON> ' sremarks would be strictly not-for-publication . 
Too bad , since we would have loved to hear the promised " lessons [ <PERSON>Kraushaar</PERSON> ] andher staff learned when a private story suddenly became public . " 
Kraushaarfamously took a turn in the spotlight last year whenhttp : / / www.thedaily.com/page/2011/11/08/110811-news-cain-accuser-1-3/-URL-theDaily revealed that she had accused <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> , then a candidate for the Republicanpresidential nomination , of sexual harassment in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> . 
Once her name wasrevealed , http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/karen-kraushaar-now-wants-to-go-public-with-other-women-with-allegations-against-herman-cain/2011/11/08/gIQA8cZW2M_blog.html-URL-shetold <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> she wanted to hold a news conference with severalother women who had made similar claims against Cain.Which , presumably would have been on the record . 
Anyway , the rest of the storyis well known : <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> eventually dropped out of the race in the face of themounting accusations.We caught up with <PERSON>Kraushaar</PERSON> before she talked on <DATE>Friday</DATE> , and she told us thather remarks were for the audience of federal workers only.Husbandry and suchIn <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , jobs on Capitol Hill can require credentials beyond thosedirectly related to the work itself.Take this recent want ad from the office ofhttp : / / steveking.house.gov / - URL-Rep . 
<PERSON>Steve King</PERSON> ( R-Iowa ) , who 's looking for an " Agriculture Legislative Assistant . " 
" Qualified candidates will be committed , pro-life conservatives with strongwriting skills , " the job posting begins , and " a firm understanding ofagriculture issues and policy , and substantive experience working inagriculture . 
" While not as important as being a committed pro-life conservative , the ad notesthat " <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> ties are a plus . 
" So send a rsum and cover letter if you 're interested . 
The job is still open , wewere told Monday.It 's just another wordWhen http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-federal-panels-vote-on-turkey-and-religious-freedom-four-tops-five/2012/03/27/gIQAdQy7eS_story.html-URL - last we checked in with thehttp : / / www.uscirf.gov/-URL-U.S . 
Commission on <ORGANIZATION>International Religious Freedom</ORGANIZATION> , it had miraculously figured out how four votes is greater than five . 
Now thecommission is being sued in federal court for discriminating against Muslims , our colleague <PERSON>Michelle Boorstein</PERSON> reports.http : / / www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/under-god/post/federal-lawsuit-charges-religious-freedom-commission-with-discriminating-against-muslims/2012/06/08/gJQAs62NOV_blog.html-URL-The lawsuitalleges the nine-member commission reneged on hiring a Muslim lawyer in 2009once it learned of her faith and her work advocating for <ORGANIZATION>American Muslims</ORGANIZATION> . 
( Noneof the current members were on the commission at the time . ) 
The lawsuit says USCIRF staff encouraged <PERSON>Safiya Ghori-Ahmad</PERSON> , who worked brieflyat the commission , to call in sick on the days that particular commissionerswere in the office , to " downplay her religious affiliation " and to emphasizethat she is a " mainstream and ' moderate ' Muslim " who does n't cover her hair.Aponte againIt seems the long-stalled nomination of http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/post/aponte-nomination-its-all-about-rubio/2011/12/15/gIQA72HjwO_blog.html-URL-Mari <PERSON>Carmen Aponte</PERSON> as ambassador to <ORGANIZATION>El Salvador</ORGANIZATION> could bemoving again.We hear <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON>Harry M. Reid</PERSON> might schedule a vote as early asthis week . 
Aponte 's nomination fell through the last time the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> voted on itlate <DATE>last year</DATE> , when supporters did n't have enough votes to overcome aRepublican filibuster.Another go at the nomination could throw Sen. <PERSON>Marco Rubio</PERSON> back into thespotlight . 
The <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> Republican initially voted against breaking thefilibuster - but later agreed to back <PERSON>Aponte</PERSON> and to round up the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> votesneeded to clear her nomination . 
Talks between <PERSON>Rubio</PERSON> and Democrats ended inhttp : / / blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_politics/2011/12/sniping-continues-over-rubio-aponte-effort-reids-office-dismisses-rubios-last-minute-as-too-little-too-late-ploy.html-URL-bitter recriminations but no vote.We hear that <PERSON>Rubio</PERSON> is expected to vote for Aponte this time , but he wo n't bewhipping votes among colleagues again.Two questions : Will the second time be the charm ? 
And is it a coincidence thatPresident Obamahttp : / / www.marketwatch.com/story/president-barack-obama-to-address-nations-latino-leadership-at-naleo-conference-in-june-2012-05-21-URL-will be in <LOCATION>Orlando</LOCATION> nextweek - where he could either tout the success of a Puerto Rican-born ambassadoror blast Republicans for blocking one?With Emily Heilkamena@washpost.comThe blog : washingtonpost.com/intheloop .
