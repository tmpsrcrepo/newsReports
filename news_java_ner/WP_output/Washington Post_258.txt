THE ADTwo pro-life governors . 
Both support a constitutional amendment to protecttraditional marriage . 
The difference ? 
Romney got tough on drugs like meth . 
Henever pardoned a single criminal . 
And <PERSON>Mike Huckabee</PERSON> ? 
He granted 1,033 pardonsand commutations , including 12 convicted murderers . 
Huckabee granted moreclemencies than the previous three governors combined . 
Even reduced penaltiesfor manufacturing methamphetamine . 
On crime , the difference is judgment.ANALYSISThis is the second ad in which <PERSON>Mitt Romney</PERSON> has assailed Huckabee by name -- cushioning a negative attack by beginning with positive words that take none ofthe sting out of what follows.The claim that <PERSON>Romney</PERSON> " got tough " on drugs such as methamphetamine is underminedby the fact that the legislation he proposed as <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> governor did notpass . 
<PERSON>Huckabee</PERSON> did support and sign into law a bill reducing sentences for thoseseeking to manufacture meth to ease prison overcrowding . 
Federal authoritiescited a rising number of meth labs in <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> . 
The average meth sentence inArkansas was nine years before the legal change ; the <PERSON>Huckabee</PERSON> campaign saysRomney would have boosted his state 's penalty to a maximum of five years.Huckabee did grant the pardons and commutations cited -- twice as many as histhree predecessors combined -- and backed a notorious parole for a rapist whowent on to murder another woman . 
He rejected <PERCENT>78 percent</PERCENT> of the pardon andcommutation applications he received . 
His campaign says that <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> governorsface an unusually high number of requests because every convict is eligible forclemency . 
Romney received just 272 requests.An earlier commercial began with the " two governors " formulation and rippedHuckabee for backing tuition breaks and scholarships for some children ofillegal immigrants.As the only candidate who has used his advertising to attack a party rival byname , <PERSON>Romney</PERSON> is obviously trying to halt <PERSON>Huckabee</PERSON> 's recent surge in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> . 
Thechallenge for <PERSON>Huckabee</PERSON> 's shoestring campaign , which has run few commercials , will be to respond effectively to a candidate capable of sustaining amultimillion-dollar television blitz.Video of this ad can be found at www.washingtonpost.com/politics .
