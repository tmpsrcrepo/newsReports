The queen of daytime talk will relinquish her network television throneWednesday to oversee the rest of her sprawling kingdom , which has extended itsreach to film , <LOCATION>Broadway</LOCATION> , publishing , politics , cooking , fitness , the self-helpindustry , a fledgling cable channel and the throbbing crannies of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> ' sheart . 
" The Oprah Winfrey Show , " one of the most durable and top-rated programs in TVhistory , is ending its quarter-century run with fanfare worthy of a president orpope - or of a woman born into poverty in <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> who built a media empirearound her own nationally syndicated talk show . 
" The adversity of her childhood somehow gave her a sense of confidence , a senseof empowerment and a desire to help , and that 's part of her basic persona , " <PERSON>saysBarbara Walters</PERSON> , who has interviewed <PERSON>Winfrey</PERSON> , 57 , on multiple occasions . 
" Ithink Oprah is a superb performer . . . . She has this amazing capacity to relateto an audience , which made her a star almost from the day she started tobroadcast . 
It 's in her magazine , and it 's in everything she does . 
She talksabout herself , she touches the audience and they become almost one with her . 
" That oneness has fueled <PERSON>Winfrey</PERSON> 's show for 25 seasons , through 30,000 guests , amillion studio audience members , legions of viewers in 150 countries , 48 Emmysand the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Center Honors</ORGANIZATION> . 
Her personal net worth is <MONEY>$ 2.7 billion</MONEY> , accordingto <PERSON>Forbes</PERSON> , making her the only female African American billionaire at present.She 's used her daytime platform to establish a production company ( with projectsin film , TV and <ORGANIZATION>Sirius XM</ORGANIZATION> satellite radio ) , a glossy national magazine ( with 2million subscribers ) and a now-shuttered charity wing ( which raised more than <MONEY>$ 80 million</MONEY> and constructed schools in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> ) . 
Winfrey 's journey to the center of American consciousness started on <DATE>Sept. 8,1986</DATE> . 
The first national episode of " The Oprah Winfrey Show " was titled " How toMarry the Man/Woman of Your Choice . 
" <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> 's taped finale will be her 4,561 st show , the last in a long line ofepisodes featuring aspiration as entertainment . 
With Oprah as its guide , thecountry learned how to find its dream partner , how to dance like <PERSON>Tina Turner</PERSON> , how to negotiate racism and religion-based fear . 
" Live your best life , " imploresthe cover of every " O " magazine , whose readers are <PERCENT>88 percent</PERCENT> female . 
" Speaking for those of us who were deeply involved in civil rights , she did morefor African Americans than all of us put togther , " says <LOCATION>Del</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Eleanor HolmesNorton</PERSON> , who witnessed <PERSON>Winfrey</PERSON> 's efforts to raise funds for the <ORGANIZATION>National Councilof Negro Women</ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION>District</LOCATION> . 
" A black woman becoming an icon of educated,working-class white women is beyond anything any of us could 've hoped to do . 
Youca n't love <PERSON>Oprah</PERSON> and hate black people . 
And when you consider how much drudgeryis on television , to see this woman who stands for reading books , for makingwomen think better of themselves , for making people feel guilty if they hatedother people - she 's a phenomenon the likes of which this society has neverseen . 
" The cultural legacy of " The Oprah Winfrey Show " is at once intensely personaland too galactic to fathom.Without " The Oprah Winfrey Show , " where would we be ? 
We would n't have T-shirtbedsheets , footless pantyhose or the " The Color Purple , " the musical . 
Wewould n't have a council of chatty behavioral gurus upon whom Oprah hasbequeathed fame and success : financial taskmaster <PERSON>Suze Orman</PERSON> , cooking <PERSON>spriteRachael Ray</PERSON> , decor wizard <PERSON>Nate Berkus</PERSON> , and doctors Oz and <PERSON>Phil</PERSON> , who 've made ittheir business to be in ours . 
" Oprah " told us there is no shame in being the victim of sexual abuse . 
" Oprah " told us how to find our correct bra size.Without " The Oprah Winfrey Show , " some of us would never have picked up Tolstoyor dropped 15 pounds ( and then gained them back again ) . 
Without " Oprah , " we , asa country , would not be talking about so many issues so candidly , according toCBS chief executive <PERSON>Leslie Moonves</PERSON> . 
" We would n't have nearly as much of the dialogue we have throughout Americaabout what 's happening in our society , " says <PERSON>Moonves</PERSON> , whose CBS Corporationdistributes the show . 
" She sort of introduced what the world was like and letpeople think and talk and go from there . . . . I think it allowed other morningshows - including ' The Early Show , ' and the ' Today ' show and ' Good MorningAmerica , ' which preceded her - to change their dialogue , to be more frank , moreconversational , more relatable . 
It was n't ' I 'm going to tell people things ' asopposed to ' I 'm going to open the dialogue . ' 
" So let 's talk , <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
An Oprah-size hole is about to appear in daytimetelevision . 
How do you feel ?

" She ' sa strong female role model who transcends generations . " 
" I think she 's a strong , empowered female hero , " said <PERSON>Christian</PERSON> 's mother , <PERSON>Diane</PERSON> , as <PERSON>Jerry Seinfeld</PERSON> paid tribute to Winfrey onscreen . 
" And she is kind andempathetic to the people around her . 
" Oprah positioned her show at the vanguard of national discourse .

Oprah , newly svelte in <DATE>1988</DATE> , wheeled out 67 pounds of fat on a Radio Flyer wagon , launching the nationalpastime of battling lard in a public forum ( see : " The Biggest Loser " ) . 
Oprah wasmoved to tears by non-famous guests such as her fourth-grade teacher , the womanwith 92 personalities and the 12-year-old with muscular dystrophy . 
Oprahgleefully bellowed the names of celebrity friends who 'd stop by for a safe-zonechat ( " JOHN TRAVOLTAAA ! " ) 
, and showered audiences with expensive gifts donatedby major corporations ( " You get a car ! 
You get a car ! " ) 
. 
America , though , has been slowly turning away from <LOCATION>Oprah</LOCATION> , or at least Oprah ' stime slot . 
An average of 12.6 million people watched each episode during herpeak season , 1991-92 . 
This past season the number was just over 6 million - still topping other daytime progams but eroding alongside soap operas , asnetworks fend off the creep of cable TV by scheduling reality shows and ensemblegabfests like " The View " and " The Talk . 
" But " The Oprah Winfrey Show , " for all its longevity , was merely the root systemfor the flowering of the Oprah brand , embodied by a question that a followermight ask herself in a moment of uncertainty : " What would Oprah do ? 
" She 'd read <PERSON>Faulkner</PERSON> . 
Over the past 10 years <ORGANIZATION>Oprah 's Book Club</ORGANIZATION> - which restoredclassics to the bestseller lists and plucked new talent from obscurity - generated 22 million sales of specially branded editions of her selections.What would Oprah do?She 'd eat hickory-smoked turkey from <LOCATION>East Texas</LOCATION> . 
Soon after she featured aturkey supplier on her annual " Favorite Things " show in <DATE>2003</DATE> , the company rangup <MONEY>$ 1 million</MONEY> in sales , according to <ORGANIZATION>Bloomberg</ORGANIZATION> Businessweek.What would Oprah do?She 'd vote for <ORGANIZATION>Barack Obama</ORGANIZATION> . 
Her <DATE>May 2007</DATE> endorsement delivered <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> an " instrumental " 1 million votes over the competitive Democratic primary season , according to <ORGANIZATION>Northwestern University</ORGANIZATION> marketing professor <PERSON>Craig Garthwaite</PERSON> , whoco-wrote a <DATE>2008</DATE> study on celebrity endorsements in politics . 
" The Oprah Winfrey Show " has wrested the concept of women 's empowerment fromfeminists and put it in the hands of the masses , according to <PERSON>Marjorie Jolles</PERSON> , aprofessor of women 's and gender studies at <ORGANIZATION>Roosevelt University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I would even call it a spiritual empowerment , " <PERSON>Jolles</PERSON> says . 
" I see <PERSON>Emerson</PERSON> asher main rhetorical ancestor , in thinking that the individual is something thatunfolds in a divinely-inspired way . 
" Oprah 's own sense of destiny - " I have always known that I was born forgreatness in my life , " she told <PERSON>Walters</PERSON> in <DATE>1988</DATE> - has made her the subject ofadoration as well as derision and skepticism . 
" She believes more in inspiration and enlightenment , when the science showspeople need specific behavior change - her legacy is what I would callconscious-raising and awareness-inducing , but not behavior-changing , " says <PERSON>JohnNorcross</PERSON> , a professor of clinical psychology at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Scranton</ORGANIZATION> whowas scheduled to appear on <PERSON>Winfrey</PERSON> 's show to challenge her endorsement of " TheSecret , " a <DATE>2006</DATE> self-help book that linked positive thinking to real-worldresults . 
( His appearance was canceled after the book 's author declined toparticipate , according to <LOCATION>Norcross</LOCATION> . ) 
Winfrey 's commanding onscreen presence has inspired parodies of her pomposityand wealth on sketch shows like " <DATE>Saturday</DATE> Night Live " and " MADtv . " 
Her show wassuch a rich source of comedy because " she is a deity and reminds us of it , " sayscomedian <PERSON>Kathy Griffin</PERSON> , who regularly lampoons <PERSON>Winfrey</PERSON> in her stand-up act . 
" Even while she 's doing an incredible act of goodwill , she 's so over-the-top . 
" http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/03/AR2010120302795.htmlIn a final act ofOprahness , it seems as though <PERSON>Oprah</PERSON> was her own last guest , according toaudience members interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Tribune</ORGANIZATION> after the finale 's tapingTuesday.But with the <ORGANIZATION>Oprah Winfrey Network</ORGANIZATION> barely six months old , " final " and " last " are n't in <LOCATION>Winfrey</LOCATION> 's vocabulary . 
In the mind-over-matter physics of her universe - which is our universe - " the end " is always just " the beginning .
