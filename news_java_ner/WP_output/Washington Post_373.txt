The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Postal Service</ORGANIZATION> lost <MONEY>billions of dollars</MONEY> in revenue during the lastfiscal year as the volume of mail plunged . 
Lawmakers may one day soon considercutting mail delivery to five days a week . 
They also may need to sort out howthe <ORGANIZATION>Postal Service</ORGANIZATION> pays for the benefits of current and future retirees.But most customers only care about one thing : The fate of their neighborhoodpost office.On <DATE>Friday</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>Postal Service</ORGANIZATION> must turn over an updated list to the <ORGANIZATION>PostalRegulatory Commission</ORGANIZATION> of sites still being considered for closure orconsolidation.Despite the concern and confusion generated by the drawn-out process , PostmasterGeneral <PERSON>John E. Potter</PERSON> believes customers should extend their concern . 
" This is part of the problem when it comes to discussing the <ORGANIZATION>Postal Service</ORGANIZATION> , " hetold a lunchtime crowd at the <ORGANIZATION>National Press Club</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . 
" Because herewe are talking about a <MONEY>$ 5 billion</MONEY> ongoing deficit and we 're all wrapped up in anissue that 's probably worth on the order of <MONEY>$ 20 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$ 100 million</MONEY> atbest . 
" Closures account for a small piece of <PERSON>Potter</PERSON> 's grand plans to remake the U.S.mail system . 
He 's advocated for reducing mail delivery to five days , for asmaller workforce and a greener fleet of vehicles -- and maybe , just maybe , thechance to sell something other than stamps . 
" Given the changing use of the mail by the American public -- we 're not faultinganyone -- and given what 's going on with the economy , we need more flexibilityto manage this place so that we can get into the black , " <PERSON>Potter</PERSON> said.He 's not involved in the details of possible closures , but <PERSON>Potter</PERSON> said it ' sunlikely any facility will close before <DATE>January</DATE> . 
He 's delegated the other dirtydetails to district managers and other Washington-based officials . 
" Our folks have reached out to communities and will continue to do that , butkeep in mind that we 're facing a significant gap going forward of <MONEY>$ 5 billion</MONEY> . 
Sopeople can not expect business as usual and that we will be able to fundeverything that we currently do , " he said.Potter wants Americans to start talking about how the <ORGANIZATION>Postal Service</ORGANIZATION> will existinto the next decade and beyond . 
He wants a national conversation amonglawmakers , the mailing industry , consumers and everyone else . 
Americans willhave to consider mail volume , the frequency of delivery and the cost , he said.The <ORGANIZATION>Postal Service</ORGANIZATION> operates more retail outlets than <ORGANIZATION>Starbucks</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> andMcDonald 's combined , <PERSON>Potter</PERSON> said . 
" And we can only sell stamps , " he lamented . 
" I think we 're going to have torationalize . 
It does n't take a genius to figure out that we 're not going to sellthe same number of stamps going forward . 
" So if <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> told him next week that he could try selling just one service orproduct , what would it be ? 
" I 'd be a bank , " he said , but later admitted that " that 's not going to happen . 
" Why not ? 
" Politics , " he said.Fumbling on <ORGANIZATION>FingerprintsThe Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> hired more than 162,000 temporary workers this year to work onpreparations for the <DATE>2010</DATE> decennial census . 
The agency had to fingerprint eachworker for a mandatory <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> criminal background check . 
But the Census Bureaufailed to get readable prints for at least a fifth of those temporary hires , according to a Government Accountability report released this week.Poorly trained Census employees improperly printed their temporary colleaguesand the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> advised the agency to conduct background checks based solely on anapplicant 's name , the report said . 
" It is possible that more than 200 people with unclassifiable prints haddisqualifying criminal records but still worked , and had contact with the publicduring address canvassing , " the <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> estimated.Workers who do address canvassing go street-by-street to make sure thataddresses do indeed exist.Of the temporary hires that did get printed , approximately <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> hadcriminal records , the <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> said . 
Of those , 750 were fired , because they hadcommitted more serious crimes such as rape , manslaughter and child abuse.The <ORGANIZATION>Census Bureau</ORGANIZATION> said it will retrain employees to address the <ORGANIZATION>GAO</ORGANIZATION> 's concerns.It has been working on its fingerprint background checks , spokesman <PERSON>StephenBuckner</PERSON> said . 
When asked , <PERSON>Buckner</PERSON> was unaware of any incidences of criminalactivity committed by the temporary employees . 
This was the first time theCensus Bureau has fingerprinted its temporary workers.What of the DCIPS?Your ( substitute ) Diarist received several anxious queries from readersregarding the fate of the <ORGANIZATION>Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System</ORGANIZATION> , thepay-for-performance system used by some defense and intelligence personnel.Concerned readers wanted to know if their version of the <ORGANIZATION>National SecurityPersonnel System</ORGANIZATION> also got repealed in the compromise version of the DefenseDepartment authorization bill announced Wednesday.Turns out the compromise suspends DCIPS for one year pending a congressionalreview . 
This means current employees stay in the system , but nobody else cantransition into it . 
The <ORGANIZATION>National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency</ORGANIZATION> , which has usedDCIPS longer than any other agency , is exempt from the suspension.Joe <PERSON>Davidson</PERSON> is away . 
He will resume writing this column when he returns .
