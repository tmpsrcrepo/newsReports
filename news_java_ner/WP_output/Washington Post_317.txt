IF EVER THERE was a case that illustrated why electing judges is a bad idea , itis the one out of <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to hearthis morning.In <DATE>2002</DATE> , <PERSON>Hugh Caperton</PERSON> and his business partners won a <MONEY>$ 50 million</MONEY> judgmentagainst the <ORGANIZATION>A.T. Massey Coal Co</ORGANIZATION> . 
The chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Massey</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Don L.Blankenship</PERSON> , was outraged , and he vowed to appeal to the <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>SupremeCourt of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> . 
But before the appeal was filed , Mr. <PERSON>Blankenship</PERSON> led acampaign to defeat a sitting <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> justice who he believed was unfair tobusiness interests and too soft on crime ; one ad campaign Mr. <PERSON>Blankenship</PERSON> helpedto fund accused the sitting judge of freeing a child molester . 
Mr. <PERSON>Blankenshipalso</PERSON> directly donated or helped raise money for <PERSON>Brent Benjamin</PERSON> , who was runningto unseat the incumbent judge . 
In total , Mr. <PERSON>Blankenship</PERSON> was responsible forsome <MONEY>$ 3 million</MONEY> that found its way into the judicial race.Mr . 
Benjamin prevailed and thus wound up as one of five justices hearingMassey 's <MONEY>$ 50 million</MONEY> appeal . 
He was part of the 3-2 majority that overturned theverdict.The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> is not being asked to judge the propriety of statejudicial elections , although the sometimes seedy , often controversial nature ofsuch events serves as the backdrop . 
The question before the justices is whetherMr . 
<PERSON>Caperton</PERSON> 's rights to due process under the 14th Amendment were violated byJustice <PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON> 's decision not to step aside from the <PERSON>Massey</PERSON> case.Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION>Massey</ORGANIZATION> argue that <ORGANIZATION>Justice Benjamin</ORGANIZATION> had no obligation to recusehimself because he was not shown to have a real conflict or suffer from actualbias . 
They also note that <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> has never before requireddisqualification because of campaign spending.In fact , <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> has previously ruled that recusal is required only ifa judge is faced with presiding over a case in which he or she has a financialinterest or , more rarely , in certain contempt proceedings that arise from alitigant 's verbal assaults on that judge . 
Yet lawyers for Mr. <PERSON>Caperton</PERSON> arguethat due process is also violated when a judge presides over the case of alitigant who played a pivotal role in getting that judge elected , thus creatingan appearance or " probability of bias . 
" As a matter of law , this is a more difficult case than it may appear . 
If thecourt rules that Mr. <PERSON>Caperton</PERSON> 's rights were violated , it may soon find itself ina thicket of related cases involving possible conflicts of interest by judges.Maybe <MONEY>$ 3 million</MONEY> is obviously enough to create the appearance of a conflict , butwhat about <MONEY>$ 100,000</MONEY> ? 
In an amicus brief , the Conference of Chief Justicessuggested that the total sum of money and timing , among other factors , should beconsidered in determining recusals . 
That approach makes sense , but it would beonly the beginning of the debate.As a matter of practice , this is a lot easier . 
States should consider barringjudges from considering cases involving litigants or lawyers who were directlyor indirectly responsible for campaign contributions beyond a certain limit.More fundamental , states should consider abolishing judicial elections in favorof an appointment system that distances jurists from politics and fundraising.Do you have a different view of this issue ?
