It is difficult to unleash your inner <PERSON>Bob Marley</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> , butsinger-songwriter Abazar Hamid is trying . 
He submits peace and love songs monthafter month to the government 's music monitoring committee , an apparently surlybunch that mostly censors and rejects them . 
" Songs like ' <LOCATION>New Sudan</LOCATION> , ' they did n't like . 
Songs like ' <ORGANIZATION>Peace Darfur</ORGANIZATION> , ' theydid n't like . 
Next week , I 'll try the <LOCATION>Abyei</LOCATION> song , " <PERSON>Hamid</PERSON> said , referring to areggae song about a contested Sudanese town recently destroyed by governmentforces . 
It includes the controversial line , " My brother , be with me . " 
" I talk with them and talk with them , and sometimes they allow it , " he said.Hamid , who is 37 and sweet-voiced , has earned some renown around <LOCATION>Khartoum</LOCATION> , thecapital , for his sentimental love songs that get radio airplay . 
But he recentlydecided to give up his day job as an architect to devote himself full time tothe more controversial goal of using music to transform a country so often atwar with itself.At the moment , there is conflict in the <LOCATION>Darfur</LOCATION> region in the west , thepossibility of a return to civil war in the south and rebels in the east.In that context , Hamid 's <ORGANIZATION>Rainbow Project</ORGANIZATION> involves trying to slip lyrics abouthuman rights and dignity past the suspicious government monitors . 
Hamid , amarried father of three who favors groovy hippie shirts and knit caps , is alsohoping to record an album of peace songs , if he can find the money and aproducer abroad.But he was here in this desert trading town in <LOCATION>Darfur</LOCATION> recently working on themost ambitious part of the project . 
It 's an effort to reform the traditionalArab singers known as <LOCATION>Hakama</LOCATION> -- more colloquially , the Janjaweed women -- whoare about as far from <PERSON>Bob Marley</PERSON> as it gets . 
" They are singing you have to kill , kill , kill , " <PERSON>Hamid</PERSON> said . 
" They have a biginfluence on the community and a very dangerous role in conflict . 
" A bit propagandists , a bit hate radio , Hakama singers exist in just about everyArab town and village in <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> . 
Their traditional role is to compose and singsongs to stir up men 's baser instincts and launch them to war.During the early part of the <LOCATION>Darfur</LOCATION> conflict , many were paid with cash , gold andjewelry by local authorities to sing songs urging the government 's nomadic Arabmilitias -- which came to be known as the Janjaweed -- to kill , rape and pillageethnically African civilians . 
According to an Amnesty International report , onelyric went like this : " The blood of the blacks runs like water , we take their goods and we chase themfrom our area and our cattle will be in their land ! 
" Hamid sat in the hot shade of a tree with a dozen or so Hakama singers , tryingto convince them of the less financially rewarding , and perhaps less exciting , merits of singing about peace.Wrapped in green , red , yellow and peach sarongs , their eyes rimmed black withkohl , the women did not seem entirely convinced . 
One heavily perfumed womanboasted that her beauty and voice had persuaded five men to go to war , wherethey all died . 
" I felt very brave and ran after the horses without my head scarf , " said thewoman , <PERSON>Khadija Jacob</PERSON> , recalling the day she sent a group of several thousandmilitiamen to fight . 
" I felt proud because of that . 
We feel excited . 
When it iswar , you have to do that . 
If you do n't sing for your men to kill , other men willcome and kill you . 
" Hamid pressed on . 
He taught the women the lyrics to " Peace Darfur , " and theysang it with faint enthusiasm . 
He talked with them about how they felt now , seeing the destruction the war has caused . 
" I want the men to go outside the village and fight because I 'm afraid of war , " Jacob told him . 
" Later , I felt sorry , because I know one day my family will beaffected , and because I see the child of a man who died every day " around town.The main obstacle to reforming the <LOCATION>Hakama</LOCATION> singers , <PERSON>Hamid</PERSON> said , is money . 
As theHakama leader , <PERSON>Fatima Osman Ahmed</PERSON> , told him : " Many people can pay for war -- nobody pays for peace . " 
" This is a problem , " <PERSON>Hamid</PERSON> said . 
" How to make money off of this . 
" Hamid said he 'd never heard of <PERSON>Bob Geldof</PERSON> , the rock star , political activist andpromoter who has helped organize several music festivals to benefit <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> , thelatest being Live 8 in <DATE>July 2005</DATE> . 
" I was never contacted , " <PERSON>Hamid</PERSON> said , seeming genuinely surprised that he was n't . 
For now , <LOCATION>Hamid</LOCATION> -- whose favorite singers are <PERSON>Marley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ray Charles</PERSON> -- makeswhat money he can performing at festivals , such as one here recently . 
Dozens oftraditional Arab leaders in white robes danced and shook their walking sticks tothe rollicking , synthesized " Peace Darfur " before local authorities shut downthe concert early.Some of his songs have been played on Sudanese radio , mostly innocuous ones . 
" The love songs make it , " he said . 
" The others , they do n't . 
" Hamid , who lives in an apartment in <LOCATION>Khartoum</LOCATION> , has a lawyer , and they often arguewith members of the government committee when they try to censor his lyrics orban his songs . 
Sometimes it works.He recently cut a pragmatic deal with the censors to let him record and produce " New Sudan " and " Peace Darfur " in exchange for never singing a song he wrotetitled " Enough . " 
" And now the whispering became screaming , " the lyrics go . 
" And the ash burns asa fire in opposition to cheating . 
We will not wait for a long time . 
We will notwait until night .
