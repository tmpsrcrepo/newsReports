A small pack of elementary-school-age kids surrounded me every time I left myfavorite lunch spot , <ORGANIZATION>Chez Noura</ORGANIZATION> . 
They held up old wine bottles filled with friedgroundnuts . 
" Madame , please , I need to eat , " they shouted.I never bought the nuts . 
I ran the eight-foot gantlet from the Lebaneserestaurant 's entrance to my parked <ORGANIZATION>Toyota</ORGANIZATION> SUV , with my 2-year-old daughter , <PERSON>Elle</PERSON> , slung over my hip . 
Sometimes I gave the kids taffy or leftover shawarma.Usually , I quickly strapped Elle into her car seat and , like many expatriatewives in this poor West African nation , tried to avoid the swirl of desperatechildren.One afternoon , however , I saw something impossible to ignore . 
Unaware that oneside of her tank top had slid off her tiny shoulder , a young girl standing inthe crowd next to my car clutched a bottle of nuts under one arm and waved to mewith the other , revealing a long , wide scar where a small nipple or buddingbreast should have been.My eyes darted from the girl 's missing breast to her big brown eyes and back toher chest . 
She disappeared in the distance as I drove away . 
The encounterrevealed to me that a Cameroonian tradition I had heard vague whispers aboutmight actually exist : breast ironing , in which women flatten adolescent girls ' developing breasts , intending to protect the girls from the dangers of sex , consensual or otherwise.The phenomenon gained some international attention in <DATE>2006</DATE> , thanks to a campaignby a nonprofit organization . 
Since then , <ORGANIZATION>the State Department</ORGANIZATION> has includedbreast ironing in its annual reports on human rights abroad . 
But despite theincreased attention , the practice persists . 
It affects as many as one in fourgirls , according to local health activists . 
Some mothers massage hotgrinding-stones into their daughters ' chests , while others pound the tissue withheated plantain peels . 
Sometimes , women rub kerosene or medicinal herbs onadolescent breasts.To understand what would drive a mother to press a hot stone into her daughter ' schest , I talked to local women , girls , physicians and community organizers.Despite the pain and fear , many of the women and girls involved in breastironing considered it a normal treatment for early breast development . 
Motherstold me they forcibly try to eliminate signs of puberty to protect their preteengirls from HIV and pregnancy . 
One mother explained that she did it out of love.Elle and I moved to <LOCATION>Douala</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION> in <DATE>January 2009</DATE> to join my husband , <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> , who had spent more than two years working there and traveling back andforth to see us . 
I had first stumbled on the subject of breast ironing in <DATE>2006</DATE> , and once we settled there I wanted to know if the practice was still a realityof life . 
The seemingly barbaric treatment sounded like a close cousin to femalegenital mutilation , which , although prevalent in other African countries , israre in <LOCATION>Cameroon</LOCATION> , according to activists . 
Both traditions purport to preserveinnocence , but those familiar with breast ironing explain that it evolved tocounteract a teen-pregnancy problem.I began looking into the practice by asking local women around <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> 's officewhat they knew . 
Most of them responded with blank stares . 
When I asked Elle ' sbabysitter , she became uncomfortable , clicking her tongue and shaking her head.She said she had never heard of it . 
A few weeks later , however , she confidedthat she had a cousin whose breasts had been ironed . 
Slowly , other women openedup , too , revealing not only the methods but also the purpose -- keeping younggirls chaste.In <LOCATION>Cameroon</LOCATION> , being young and pregnant is not uncommon . 
Additionally , anestimated <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of women have unwanted pregnancies , according to localhealth-care workers.Caroline Nkeih , a veterinarian and mother of four , said she knows two familieswith daughters who became pregnant at 12 . 
For this reason , in her mind themerits of breast ironing outweigh any physical or emotional consequences . 
Oneafternoon at her home in the <LOCATION>Bonaberi</LOCATION> district of <LOCATION>Douala</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Nkeih</PERSON> explained whyshe ironed her daughter <ORGANIZATION>Endam</ORGANIZATION> 's breasts two years earlier , when she was just 10years old . 
" Boys can start looking at the girls , when their breasts appear . 
At12 years old , they are still children , but the boys see the breasts , " she said.She explained that if a girl develops at age 8 or 9 , many mothers think it ' snecessary to " press the breasts . 
" <PERSON>Nkeih</PERSON> said she warmed a long wooden pestle over her gas stove and rubbed each ofEndam 's breasts for five minutes . 
She said she treated Endam twice before thebreasts retreated , only to reappear a year later.Serges Moukam has an ob-gyn practice in <LOCATION>Douala</LOCATION> and knows well the " povertyperpetuating " problem of teen pregnancy . 
Promiscuity and rape both factor intothe high teen pregnancy rate , and breast ironing , <PERSON>Moukam</PERSON> said , prevents neither.In an interview in his cramped office , he said pregnant girls ages 12 to 17 makeup 25 to <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of his patients . 
" It 's very rare to see a 13-year-old girlwho is still a virgin , " he said.Flavien Ndonko , an anthropologist at the German Agency for TechnicalCooperation , runs the nonprofit group that launched the <DATE>2006</DATE> anti-breast-ironingcampaign and leads the fight against the practice in <LOCATION>Cameroon</LOCATION> . 
" It 's bodymutilation and against women 's rights , " he said . 
From his office in the capital , <LOCATION>Yaounde</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Ndonko</PERSON> listed the consequences of breast ironing , including abscesses , infection , deformation , lactation problems , cysts , possible links to breastcancer and emotional stress.Ndonko first learned about the tradition in <DATE>2005</DATE> while training teen mothers andrape victims to work as part of a network of health activists . 
Breast ironingcame up during discussions among the trainees . 
Ndonko said he realized he haduncovered an alarming problem . 
The following year , the German organizationsurveyed 5,651 girls and women , between ages 10 and 22 , and found that 24percent had experienced breast ironing . 
He said his organization 's awarenesscampaign brought breast ironing " out of the kitchen , " where the practice isusually carried out , and into the spotlight.During an interview in his office , <PERSON>Ndonko</PERSON> produced a list of hundreds ofvictims . 
" They do it so girls do not become pregnant , " he said . 
" But girls stillget pregnant , even earlier than they thought . " 
Slicing symbolically at his facewith his hands , he added : " Not only breasts attract young men . 
What will theydo ? 
Cut lips , eyes , nose ? 
" Ndonko 's findings matched what I encountered . 
During a meeting of local teenagegirls in <LOCATION>Douala</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Dolvine Massah</LOCATION> , 13 , recounted the first time her mother ironedher breasts , when she was 11 . 
She said her older brother called her to thekitchen , where her mother warmed plantains over the fire . 
Then , <LOCATION>Massah</LOCATION> said , herbrother " arrested " her , forcing her lanky frame onto a wooden bench . 
Sheremembered screaming while her mother pressed the hot plantain peels onto herbreasts . 
After a year of treatments , sometimes as many as three a week , Massahsaid she still feared that call to the kitchen.Justine Kwachu , executive director and co-founder of Women in AlternativeAction , a nonprofit organization in <LOCATION>Yaounde</LOCATION> promoting women 's equality , lobbiesnot only for sex education but for punishment . 
In <DATE>2006</DATE> , she began researchinglaws to criminalize breast ironing and other discriminatory practices . 
Kwachu , whose sister performed breast ironing , petitions Cameroonian parliamentariansfor support of anti-discrimination legislation that proposes a 10-year prisonsentence for those caught practicing the custom.Others suggest more tolerance for the mothers . 
Emilia Lifaka , one of 25 femaleparliamentarians and the vice speaker of the <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> , said in atelephone interview that practices such as breast ironing call for moreeducation , not legislation . 
Lifaka , who represents a region cited by local mediaas having a high rate of teen pregnancy , played down the prevalence of breastironing , and said she thinks few women still do it.Ndonko , the anthropologist and activist , painted a darker picture based on hisresearch . 
He said that despite increasing awareness , he hears of new breastironing cases " every day . 
" Recently , a lone preteen girl selling groundnuts approached me at my car . 
Istill declined the nuts , but rather than ignoring her , I asked if she knew aboutbreast ironing . 
She smiled , a bit embarrassed , looked down and nodded . 
She saidher breasts had been ironed two years earlier.jsrich@me.comJamie Rich is a freelance writer who recently relocated to <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION> afterliving in <LOCATION>Cameroon</LOCATION> .
