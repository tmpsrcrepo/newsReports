A new study has found that paying welfare benefits via debit card , rather thancash , caused a <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> drop in crime.Researchers have long noted that cash plays a critical role in street crime , because of its liquidity ( it is easy to obtain , and everyone accepts it ) andanonymity ( it leaves no paper trail ) . 
In poorer neighborhoods , public assistancepayments used to be a significant source of circulating cash : Recipients wouldcash their assistance checks at the bank , pocketing the money and becomingattractive targets for criminals.But that changed , starting in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> , as the federal government graduallyphased out paper welfare checks in favor of electronic debit cards - theElectronic Benefit Transfer ( EBT ) program . 
Along with a team of researchers , <PERSON>Richard Wright</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Missouri</ORGANIZATION> studied the effects of this changein his home state and found that it was directly responsible for a 10 percentdrop in the overall crime rate there.The authors found that " burglary , assault , and larceny decreased by <PERCENT>7.9 percent ,12.5 percent</PERCENT> , and <PERCENT>9.6 percent</PERCENT> , respectively . " 
They also found correspondingdrops in arrest rates that supported their findings.They also looked at the incidence of rape , which showed little change betweenthe pre - and post-EBT eras . 
Because rape is " typically unrelated to theimmediate acquisition of cash , " this did n't come as a surprise.To put these results in perspective , the overall <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> decrease in crimecorresponded to 47 fewer crimes per 100,000 people per county per month as adirect result of switching welfare benefits from cash to debit cards.The finding raises interesting questions.First , did the drop in crime occur simply because criminals decided to pack upand move elsewhere ? 
The authors tested for this and found no evidence thatcriminals switched counties , noting that this finding was " consistent withcriminological literature indicating that offenders tend to operate within theirown geographical awareness space . 
" Second , what if we expand the definition of " elsewhere " to include virtual aswell as physical space ? 
It stands to reason that a shift from paper toelectronic currency would cause a concomitant shift from physical to virtualcrime - if criminals ca n't pick your pocket , maybe they 'll figure out how topick your bank account.Wright 's study did not dig into these questions , but as society gradually shiftsfrom physical to virtual currency in bitcoin and beyond , such issues will becomeincreasingly important.Finally , to what extent can we extrapolate nationally from these findings?Wright and his co-authors note that the widespread drop in crime in the UnitedStates over the past several decades corresponds to a decline in the proportionof transactions involving cash . 
While there are many possible explanations forthis , the paper notes that " a significant fraction of the decline has yet to beidentified empirically . 
" While a lot more research is needed on these questions , <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> 's paper stronglysuggests that less cash equals less crime.christopher.ingraham@washpost.comExcerpted from <LOCATION>Wonkblog</LOCATION> , at washingtonpost.com/wonkblog .
