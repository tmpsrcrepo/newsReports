About <PERSON>Roger Goodell</PERSON> 's raised consciousness . 
About the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> commissioner ' sseemingly unbidden turnabout on the subject of domestic violence , hisuncharacteristic admission that he " did n't get it right " when he suspendedex-Baltimore Ravens running back <PERSON>Ray Rice</PERSON> only two games for socking his fianceeunconscious , while throwing the book at marijuana tokers . 
About the curioustiming of <PERSON>Goodell</PERSON> 's much-congratulated epiphany , and the <PERSON>Ravens</PERSON> ' sudden moraloutrage , and the appearance of that stomach heave-inducing elevator video onTMZ , in which Rice decks his bride-to-be so hard she drops like a piece of lostluggage from an airplane bay.The Ravens promptly terminated <PERSON>Rice</PERSON> 's contract on <DATE>Monday</DATE> and <PERSON>Goodell</PERSON> , ever inpursuit of a stainless suit-coat , reopened the case and suspended Riceindefinitely under his revised policy on domestic assault , given this graphic " new " evidence . 
But really , what did <PERSON>Goodell</PERSON> and the Ravens think a professionalfootball player knocking his wife unconscious looked like?That <PERSON>Goodell</PERSON> is an unduly vain commissioner , and a self-serving one with his eyeon some further prize , has always been obvious . 
That he obfuscates and evades ontough issues unless they are convenient for him , that his convictions are highlyselective and so is his enforcement , has never been more apparent . 
On Mondaymorning , with the surfacing of that video , <PERSON>Goodell</PERSON> 's nature became totallyclear . 
The <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> claims in a statement that no one in the league office hadpreviously seen the tape . 
That is almost surely not the truth , unless the NFLwanted it that way . 
This is a league that works with <ORGANIZATION>Homeland Security</ORGANIZATION> , conferswith the <ORGANIZATION>Drug Enforcement Agency</ORGANIZATION> , collaborates with law enforcement and has itsown highly equipped and secretive private security arm . 
You 're telling me itcould n't get a hold of a grainy tape from an <LOCATION>Atlantic City</LOCATION> casino elevator ? 
ButTMZ could?If <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> executives and <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> Ravens staff had never seen that tape before , there are only two reasons : willful blindness , and the determination to maintainplausible deniability . 
Two <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> analysts with reputations for impeccable sources , <PERSON>Peter King</PERSON> of Sports Illustrated and <PERSON>Chris Mortensen</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>ESPN</ORGANIZATION> , were told monthsago the league had to have seen the tape . 
<PERSON>Ray Rice</PERSON> 's own attorney had a copy ofit . 
It simply defies belief that league and team officials could n't have seen itif they wanted to.All the tape does is put the full lie to the specious reasons the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> and theRavens offered for being lenient on Rice - he was defending himself , there wereextenuating circumstances , he felt terrible about the incident . 
And of course , the woman partly had it coming . 
" <PERSON>Janay Rice</PERSON> says she deeply regrets the rolethat she played the night of the incident , " the <PERSON>Ravens tweeted.All</PERSON> of it is belied by the tape . 
The young woman is clearly having a disputewith her fiance . 
They argue , he snaps at her , she swats a hand at him . 
They geton the elevator , they argue more , she says something and moves toward him - andhe drops her , bam . 
And then stands over her for a moment , and lugs her out ofthe elevator like he 's hauling a sack of cement.Did <PERSON>Goodell</PERSON> and so many others in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> really need to see the tape beforethey were properly horrified ? 
It 's impossible to reread the letter <PERSON>Goodell</PERSON> sentto <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> team owners describing his change of heart on domestic violence on <DATE>Aug. 28</DATE> with anything but a rueful , bitter hilarity . 
" The reality is that domesticviolence and sexual assault are often hidden crimes , ones that areunder-reported and under-acknowledged , " <PERSON>Goodell</PERSON> wrote . 
You bet they are , especially if the videotape is buried.Goodell went on : " My disciplinary decision led the public to question oursincerity , our commitment , and whether we understood the toll that domesticviolence inflicts on so many families . 
" On <DATE>Monday</DATE> , <PERSON>Goodell</PERSON> 's audience found itself in the position of questioning thesincerity of his apology for behaving in a way that led to his sincerity beingquestioned . 
For years now , <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> players have questioned his sincerity on issueslike concussions , player safety , discipline and drug testing . 
With the Ricescandal , the full football viewing public will likely now view <PERSON>Goodell</PERSON> throughthe same skeptical lens.sally.jenkins@washpost.comFor more by <PERSON>Sally Jenkins</PERSON> , visit washingtonpost.com/jenkins .
