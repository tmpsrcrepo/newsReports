The release of a report on the child sexual abuse scandal involving former <ORGANIZATION>PennState</ORGANIZATION> football assistant <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky</PERSON> led to countless re-evaluationsThursday , most notably of <PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>Nittany Lions</ORGANIZATION> ' late coach . 
Thereport 's details - a timeline of who knew what , when they knew it , and whatsteps were and were n't taken - shook all sorts of corners in college athletics , with plenty of room for introspection . 
" I think when something like this happens , as shocking as it is , we 've all gotto take a minute to look upon how we can prevent it , how we would deal with anyaccusations that would come to light early on , " said <PERSON>Norwood Teague</PERSON> , the newathletic director at <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> who previously held the same job at VirginiaCommonwealth.That process will happen in different places at different paces . 
_ blankIn astatement , the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> said it was too early to determine whether information inthe report , compiled by investigators led by former <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>Louis Freeh</PERSON> , could lead to sanctions against the athletic department . 
<ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> still mustanswer questions contained _ blankin a letter , sent by <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Mark Emmertlast November</PERSON> , regarding " compliance with institutional control and ethicspolicies , " according to the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> 's statement.But even with the dramatic information the report revealed - including <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> ' sknowledge of an investigation into former defensive coordinator <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky</PERSON> ' simproper behavior in <DATE>1998</DATE> - there may not be evidence that would cause futureproblems for <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> 's athletic department . 
" The information in there about child sexual assault , those are n't currentlyNCAA rules violations , " said <PERSON>Michael L. Buckner</PERSON> , an attorney whose firmfrequently represents schools in <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> cases . 
" The Freeh report documented - generally , philosophically - a lack of control . 
But did it lack institutionalcontrol as defined in the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> manual ? 
" The fallout from <ORGANIZATION>Freeh</ORGANIZATION> 's report was n't contained just to <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> , either.Officials for <ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> , the official supplier of <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> athletic equipment andapparel , announced they would rename the <ORGANIZATION>Joe Paterno Child Development Center</ORGANIZATION> onits <LOCATION>Beaverton</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION> , campus . 
<ORGANIZATION>Nike</ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON>Phil Knight</PERSON> , an emotional and staunchsupporter who passionately defended <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> at his memorial service , _ blankissued a statement <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that showed the impact of <ORGANIZATION>Freeh</ORGANIZATION> 's report . 
" According to the investigation , it appears <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> made missteps that led toheartbreaking consequences , " <PERSON>Knight</PERSON> said . 
" I missed that <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> missed it , and I amextremely saddened on this day . 
My love for <PERSON>Joe</PERSON> and his family remains . 
" The <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> case , and the lack of urgent response by a number of <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> Stateofficials as outlined in <ORGANIZATION>Freeh</ORGANIZATION> 's report , has brought the question : How couldthis happen ? 
But athletic department officials at several schools said <PERSON>Thursdaythey</PERSON> have long had procedures in place for reporting suspected crimes eitherinvolving athletic department staff or taking place on campus . 
" We had policies and procedures and flow charts , and we were aware of all thenecessary things we had to do legally even before the whole <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> case , " said <PERSON>Tom O'Connor</PERSON> , the athletic director at <ORGANIZATION>George Mason</ORGANIZATION> . 
" It 's a priority withus . 
It 's always been a priority with us . 
<ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> did n't trigger it , becausewe always felt we had the right policies in place . 
" Just five weeks after a grand jury indicted <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> on 40 counts of sex crimesin <DATE>November</DATE> , the <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> university system put into place _ blanka policyoutlining exactly what university employees and students are to do if theysuspect child abuse or neglect.Through a spokesman , <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> Athletic Director <PERSON>Kevin Anderson</PERSON> declined tocomment for this story - both in his capacity overseeing the Terrapins ' athleticdepartment and in his role as the new president of <ORGANIZATION>the National Association ofCollege Directors of Athletics</ORGANIZATION> . 
But the policy mandates that <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> employeesreport suspected incidents of abuse both to the police or social services and tothe school president 's office . 
Failure to do so can result in " discipline forprofessional misconduct , up to and including termination . 
" <PERSON>Anderson</PERSON> 's predecessor at <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Debbie Yow</PERSON> , said that in her final few yearsin College Park , all returning athletes were asked a question in an annualsurvey : " Has there been any inappropriate touching by an administrator orcoach ? " 
<LOCATION>North Carolina State</LOCATION> , where <PERSON>Yow</PERSON> is now the athletic director , includesthe same question on its survey.N.C . 
State and other schools conduct training before each academic year to makesure coaches and administrators are familiar with their responsibilities toreport suspected crimes on campus under the _ blankClery Act , a federal statutethat requires colleges and universities to keep and disclose information aboutcrime . 
<LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> 's <PERSON>Teague</PERSON> said in most departments in which he has worked , " themost important speaker you have from the outside is campus police . 
" The issues surrounding the <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> situation remained incendiary even as theFreeh report landed . 
Officials at several schools - including <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , VirginiaTech and <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> - either declined to comment or did n't respond to messagesThursday . 
Some officials expressed a reluctance to review their own policiespublicly lest they appear to be criticizing <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> , who died inJanuary.Paterno 's family issued a statement <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that said , in part : " It can beargued that <PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> should have gone further . 
He should have pushed hissuperiors to see that they were doing their jobs . 
We accept this criticism .
