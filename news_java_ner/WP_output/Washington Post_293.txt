Since I bought my first house three months ago , a 59-year-old fixer-upper in theBrookland neighborhood of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , I 've had to work with a stream ofcontractors.None of them women.As a feminist , I often go out of my way to give my business to other women , especially in nontraditional fields . 
No matter how hard I looked , however , Iwould n't have been able to find many female contractors.Not when only <PERCENT>2.4 percent</PERCENT> of the 6.3 million people working in the constructiontrades in <DATE>2001</DATE> in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> were women , according to the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of LaborStatistics</ORGANIZATION> . 
With percentages that low , the only woman likely to be working on myhouse is me.These occupations , which include plumbers , carpenters , electricians , roofers , general contractors and other skilled crafts , pay pretty well . 
For example , themedian pay for an electrician in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . 
metro area is <MONEY>$ 20.69</MONEY> an hour.Electricians ' helpers average <MONEY>$ 12.03</MONEY> an hour -- certainly better than the <MONEY>$ 10.29</MONEY> parceled out to nurses ' aides , a field composed <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of women.The economic incentive to pursue this work is obviously there , so why are n'tmore women picking up a voltage tester?Patricia Jones , executive director of Nontraditional Employment for Women ( NEW ) in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> , says women who want to go into the trades must overcome severallayers of prejudice , starting when they are girls.They also face a tough work environment . 
Sexual harassment is still a problem onjob sites , she said , but the main obstacle is that you have to reestablishyourself every time you show up at a new work site . 
This is especially stressfulwhen you 're the only woman at the job . 
You 'll be lucky if they even have aseparate Porta-John for you.Gayle Nelson-Blomquist , director of development for <ORGANIZATION>Chicago Women</ORGANIZATION> in Trades , said the biggest problems are lack of knowledge about the fields , womenunderestimating their own skills and an absence of role models . 
Even if youoffer vocational training to girls , if they do n't see anyone who looks like themdoing it , they are n't likely to picture themselves doing it either , she said.Overcoming women 's lack of knowledge about the building trades and bias againstwomen in the field is n't easy , but efforts are being made . 
The Labor Departmentworks with several community organizations and labor unions to increase women ' sparticipation in the skilled trades.NEW , for example , which receives a <ORGANIZATION>Labor Department</ORGANIZATION> grant , provides basicconstruction education to the women eligible for their programs . 
Theorganization 's 12-week , full-time " Blue Collar Prep " program , for example , provides hands-on classes in carpentry , basic electricity , plumbing andblueprint reading . 
It also trains women in safety practices , catches them up onbasic math and makes sure they meet the physical-fitness requirements of thetrade.Once women have basic skills , NEW helps them find formal apprentice programswith local unions . 
Apprenticeships are the tickets to good jobs.A typical apprenticeship for an electrician , for example , lasts four to fiveyears . 
An apprentice can expect at least 144 hours of classroom time each year , and 8,000 hours of on-the-job training over the course of the training , according to the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Labor Statistics</ORGANIZATION> . 
In the classroom , apprentices learnblueprint reading , electrical theory , electronics , electrical code requirementsand safety practices . 
On the job , under the supervision of experiencedelectricians , apprentices must prove that they 've mastered the skills . 
When allthis training is complete , apprentices take licensing exams , which certify themto work in a particular state . 
In <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> , for example , to qualify to take the " master electrician " exam you must have seven years of experience working undera master electrician.The tradeswoman organizations aim to increase the number of women withhigh-level skills , in the hopes that they will sponsor more female apprentices.NEW 's <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> said her group wants to build " a critical mass of women , so we canlook out for each other .
