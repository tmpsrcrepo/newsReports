Republican presidential hopeful <PERSON>Herman Cain</PERSON> faced a new set of politicalchallenges <DATE>Monday</DATE> after graphic allegations by a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> woman raised questionsamong <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> operatives and activists about the candidate 's ability to survive thegrowing scandal.After eight days of accusations and denials of alleged sexual harassment byCain , the specific and explicit nature of the new allegations could threaten hisposition among a core group of supporters who have stood by him , or at leaststayed silent . 
" This is the first time that the allegations have been about physical ratherthan verbal harassment . 
These are much more serious charges that require <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> toprovide a more specific explanation than a blanket denial , " said <PERSON>Daniel Schnur</PERSON> , who advised Sen. <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON> 's <DATE>2000</DATE> presidential campaign but is uncommitted inthe <DATE>2012</DATE> contest.Mississippi Gov. <PERSON>Haley Barbour</PERSON> told the conservative magazine <ORGANIZATION>National Review</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>onMonday</DATE> : " If there is any substance to the claims , if the American people believethat somebody abused women , they are not going to elect him or her president . 
Ifthis were taken as being true , and people believe it 's true , then I do n't thinkthat can be overcome . 
" The initial allegations against <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> - dating to the <DATE>1990s</DATE> , when he was chiefexecutive of the <ORGANIZATION>National Restaurant Association</ORGANIZATION> - were general and unspecific , and <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> denied them.Sharon Bialek changed that <DATE>Monday</DATE> with a nationally televised news conference inwhich she accused <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> of groping her and trying to force her into a sexual act.Cain 's campaign issued another denial but did not respond directly to Bialek ' sclaims : " All allegations of harassment against Mr. <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> are completely false , " said <PERSON>J.D. Gordon</PERSON> , a <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> spokesman . 
" Mr. <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> has never harassed anyone . " 
Gordoncharacterized Bialek 's charges as " bogus attacks , " but they seem to be alteringthe political calculus for the candidate . 
" This changes the dynamic of the situation , " said <PERSON>Craig Robinson</PERSON> , a longtimeRepublican operative in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> who runs a political blog there . 
" Last week , thedefenders of Herman were saying these are all anonymous people . 
Now we have awoman who has come forward in pretty plain language about what went on . 
He ca n'tjust blame the media on this one . 
" As the news of sexual harassment charges filed against <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> in the <DATE>1990s emergedlast week</DATE> , many conservatives blasted the accusations as anonymous snipingagainst a leading Republican contender and blamed the " liberal media . 
" But Bialek 's comments will almost certainly force the former <ORGANIZATION>Godfather</ORGANIZATION> 's Pizzachief executive to offer his own version of his interactions with the woman , Republicans say . 
And the continuing focus on alleged sexual harassment in hispast could push conservative voters who galvanized behind <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> to defect . 
Thatcould significantly reorder the already topsy-turvy <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> race that has beendefined by sudden surges by different candidates in opinion polls , followed byequally sudden collapses or setbacks.Although the earlier allegations did not seem to faze some of <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> 's supporters , <ORGANIZATION>Bialek</ORGANIZATION> 's accusations seem to raise doubts among <PERSON>some.Robert Haugen</PERSON> , who runs an investment research firm in <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> and has donated <MONEY>$ 1,000</MONEY> to <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> 's campaign this year , said in an interview after <DATE>Monday</DATE> 's newsconference that the sexual harassment allegations make him " a little lesssupportive " of <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> . 
" I suspect he 's being dishonest , and I do n't want that in a president , " Haugensaid . 
" The dishonesty bothers me more than the sexual aggressiveness . 
" But other <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> backers are sticking with the candidate . 
" I do n't trust any of it , " said <PERSON>Fred Backer Jr.</PERSON> , 71 , a retired correctionalofficer in <LOCATION>Mount Morris</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> , who has donated more than <MONEY>$ 1,000</MONEY> to <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> ' scampaign . 
" The man 's been in business for 40-some years without a blemish . 
He ' shad to work with people both male and female all that time . 
It 's so out ofcharacter for him , it 's unbelievable . 
" Backer , who watched Bialek 's news conference , added , " He 's my man . 
" I 've beengiving him <MONEY>$ 150</MONEY> a month out of my Social Security every month since <DATE>May</DATE> , and I ' mgoing to keep doing that until he 's not running . 
" And antiestablishment conservative activists , who defended <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> last week , wereskeptical of <ORGANIZATION>Bialek</ORGANIZATION> 's allegations . 
" She was not employed by the restaurant association when this happened . 
Thereare no witnesses . 
She told nobody at the time that it happened , and he isdenying it , " conservative talk radio host <PERSON>Rush Limbaugh</PERSON> said on his show Monday.Bialek 's news conference came just as the furor was dying down over the news , first reported by <LOCATION>Politico</LOCATION> , that the <ORGANIZATION>National Restaurant Association</ORGANIZATION> had settleda sexual harassment claim against <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> when he led the association.A <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post-ABC News poll released <DATE>Friday</DATE> showed that <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> has survivedthe controversy politically ; the surveyhttp : / / www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cain-rises-in-post-abc-poll-despite-scandal-most-republicans-dismiss-allegations/2011/11/04/gIQApcgSlM_story.htmlhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cain-rises-in-post-abc-poll-despite-scandal-most-republicans-dismiss-allegations/2011/11/04/gIQApcgSlM_story.html showed him effectively tied for thelead in the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nominating race with former <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> governor <PERSON>Mitt Romney.Cain</PERSON> 's rivals have done little to highlight the sexual harassment issue , andneither Romney nor Rep. <PERSON>Michele Bachmann</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>Minn.</LOCATION> ) mentioned it in speeches onMonday.But Bialek 's comments are likely to cause even more criticism from moreestablishment figures in the party who were already wary of <ORGANIZATION>Cain</ORGANIZATION> , whom manyRepublicans view as a weak candidate to face President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> next year.What 's not clear is whether many Republican voters will abandon <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> . 
Hisstrength in the polls over the past month has remained despite not only thesexual harassment charges but also rivals ' attacks of his " 9-9-9 " tax plan . 
AnNBC News-Wall Street Journal poll conducted before <PERSON>Bialek</PERSON> 's news conferencefound that a majority of Republicans were not concerned about the sexualharassment allegations.Much of <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> 's support comes from the antiestablishment tea party wing of theGOP , which has been resistant to Romney but abandoned <PERSON>Bachmann</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Gov.Rick <PERSON>Perry</PERSON> after galvanizing behind both earlier in the race . 
If the sexualharassment allegations result in a significant loss of support for <ORGANIZATION>Cain</ORGANIZATION> , thatcould reshape the Republican race , perhaps offering a second chance for <PERSON>Bachmannor Perry</PERSON> or elevating another candidate , such as former <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> speaker NewtGingrich ( <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION> ) . 
Republicans say what happens to <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> 's campaign will largely rest on thecandidate himself and whether Republicans trust his denials of the multipleallegations of improper sexual behavior . 
" The thing is how much is true , " said <PERSON>Steve Scheffler</PERSON> , a longtime conservativeactivist in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> . 
" We have to see the real facts .
