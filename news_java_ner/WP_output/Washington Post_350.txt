As with " The Tin Drum , " Volker SchlÃ ¶ ndorff 's surreally allegorical <DATE>1979</DATE> filmbased on GÃ ¼ nter Grass 's book about a strangely ageless German boy , it 's hard tointerpret the events depicted in " The Notebook " - another book making the leapto the big screen - as anything other than metaphors . 
But for what , it 's notentirely clear . 
This adaptation of <PERSON>Agota Kristof</PERSON> 's <DATE>1986</DATE> novel is impossible totake literally , yet too obscure to read between the lines.On the most superficial level , the film shows how war hardens the human heart.Set in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> during the final months of World War II , " The Notebook " centerson twin boys ( played by real-life brothers AndrÃ ¡ s and LÃ ¡ szlÃ ³ GyémÃ ¡ nt ) whobecome twisted into sociopaths by their experience of brutality . 
After beingleft by their mother ( GyÃ ¶ ngyvér BognÃ ¡ r ) with their grandmother ( PiroskaMolnÃ ¡ r ) , an abusive alcoholic who lives in a hovel near a German concentrationcamp , the children gradually turn into monsters.The boys beat each other with belts and hurl insults at each other , hoping toinure themselves to physical pain and insult . 
They forgo food , roll in the snowand walk in the open during air raids in an attempt to become impervious tohunger , cold and fear.At first , these seem like understandable reactions to abandonment , compounded bythe mistreatment they receive at the hands of the grandmother , who smacks themaround , treats them like slave labor , withholds food and steals care packagesmailed to them by their mother . 
The old woman is a thoroughly nasty person , andit 's no wonder that she 's known to the locals as the " witch . 
" But the boys quickly begin to evince behavior that goes well beyond what onemight expect from children in similar straits . 
They compulsively kill insectsand then - in a shocking and , quite frankly , implausible series of escalations - do much , much worse . 
Most bizarrely , they befriend both the Nazi commander ofthe concentration camp ( <PERSON>Ulrich Thomsen</PERSON> ) , a creepy pedophile who admires theirSpartan regimen , and a kindly old Jewish shoemaker ( JÃ ¡ nos Derzsi ) who givesthem free boots.To all appearances , they are motivated neither by ideology nor human feeling.Rather , their actions seem dictated by the necessities of the fiction , the pointof which is never clear.It would be unfair to expect verisimilitude from a tale like this . 
Like Oskarfrom " The Tin Drum , " the unnamed twins - who are only ever referred to as " bastard " by their grandmother - are n't real people so much as , I do n't know , manifestations of the schizoid post-war Hungarian national psyche , or something.Inseparable throughout the film , they agree to do something at the end of themovie that is utterly preposterous , even given the bizarre occurrences that havealready taken place . 
( As in " Drum , " there is a scene of sex with an older womanthat seems a gratuitous attempt to shock , as well as other odd episodes thatlend " The Notebook " the flavor of magic realism . ) 
Yet the ending is not justbizarre , but emotionally unsupported . 
That would be fine , if only I could figureout what all this was meant to stand for.michael.osullivan@washpost.comR .
