Naturalaw ( <PERSON>Darrell Perry</PERSON> ) and Black Picasso ( <LOCATION>Patrick Washington</LOCATION> ) made theirreputations in the mid - <DATE>'90s</DATE> on the poetry slam circuit , first in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> andthen by traveling around the country . 
That explains how they recently ended upon the third-season premiere of <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> 's " <PERSON>Russel Simmons</PERSON> Presents Def Poetry " undertheir group name , the Poem-Cees . 
Unfortunately , they could n't bring along the ensemble 's third cog , DJ Stylus ( <PERSON>Rhome Anderson</PERSON> ) . 
This time , at least , it was no turntables and two microphonesas <ORGANIZATION>Naturalaw</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Black Picasso</ORGANIZATION> reverted to an old standby . 
" Because the show focuses on spoken word , there was no accompaniment except forthe human beat boxes , but <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> let them fly with that because it looked sodynamic on screen , " says Stylus , calling " Def Poetry " " an imprimatur . 
Eventhough we 've been doing our thing for a long time , it helps legitimize it . 
" In fact , it took three years of audition tapes and persistent lobbying for thePoem-Cees to land a slot on the show . 
" It was like a whirlwind when it happened because they only let you know a weekbefore , " says <PERSON>Naturalaw</PERSON> ( <PERSON>Perry</PERSON> is a lawyer by day , hence the name ) . 
" Maybe theydo n't want you to line up clothing sponsorships before you go on TV ! 
, " he jokes . 
" We did it , it was real cool and it seemed to catch people 's ears . 
Hopefully wecan use that to shed some more light on what 's going on around here . 
" Immediately , that would include the Poem-Cees ' performance <DATE>Friday</DATE> at the BlackCat , celebrating the release of their fine new CD , " Paranoia , " with acclaimedPhiladelphia spoken-word artist <PERSON>Ursula Rucker</PERSON> and local poet-actor-musician <PERSON>W.Ellington Felton</PERSON> , who guests on the new CD.On a larger level , the Poem-Cees are hoping to shed light on the historicallyunderground yet surprisingly expansive <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> hip-hop community that sprungup in the mid to late '90s , mostly , but not exclusively , around a culturally andcommercially revived U Street at venues such as <LOCATION>State of the Union</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Metro Cafeand Kaffa House</ORGANIZATION> ( now all closed ) . 
<ORGANIZATION>Kaffa House</ORGANIZATION> is where <ORGANIZATION>Naturalaw</ORGANIZATION> and BlackPicasso first hooked up with Stylus , who was house DJ at the weekly " ciphers " ( freestyle jam sessions ) . 
In fact , two concurrent communities came together inthat era : poets and spoken-word artists who gravitated to <PERSON>Toni Lightfoot</PERSON> 's openmics at It 's Your Mug , Mangos and <ORGANIZATION>Soul Brothers</ORGANIZATION> ' Pizza , and hip-hop aspirantsdrawn to <PERSON>Toni Blackman</PERSON> 's loose-knit performance groups , <ORGANIZATION>Freestyle Union</ORGANIZATION> and itsfemale counterpart , the Daughters of the Cipher . 
" One did hip-hop , one did poetry , and they cultivated a lot of the poets and MCsin this area , " Black <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> says of the two Tonis . 
In many ways , the Poem-Ceesrepresent a bridge between the structure and mature subject matter of poetry andthe groove and energy of hip-hop . 
" It brings more focus to the content , " says Stylus of the spoken-wordbackground . 
" Also showmanship , because in spoken word , presentation and styleare up there with your content ; it 's almost as if presentation and style takesthe place of music . 
We definitely want there to be weight to our content . . . . It does n't always have to be serious , but it has to be compelling and the musichas to be just as equal , just as tight as the content . " 
" I think the spoken-word background helps us to become better , more sensitivewriters , " Black <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> adds . 
" We try to write some stuff that can stand up onthe page as far as the poetry 's concerned , but also present some hip-hop thatcan rock a crowd as well . 
I do n't want to say we 're the blueprint for thefuture , but our goal is to be extremely good in each aspect as opposed to awatered-down mixture of the two that 's trying to lukewarmly capture the flavorof poetry , the flavor of hip-hop . 
" If the Poem-Cees had to list their ancestors , they 'd undoubtedly point to De LaSoul and the <ORGANIZATION>Jungle Brothers</ORGANIZATION> , a pair of <ORGANIZATION>Native Tongue</ORGANIZATION> archetypes from the late '80s and early '90s . 
De La Soul , Stylus explains , because " they have a knack foraddressing common themes in a really extraordinary fashion , and that 's what wetry to do . 
They also had two MCs [ Posdnous and Trugoy ] with distinctivelydifferent styles , like <ORGANIZATION>DP</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Patrick</PERSON> . 
" Collectively , the <ORGANIZATION>Jungle Brothers</ORGANIZATION> are " our biggest influence . 
When they were attheir peak creatively , they were so slick , they sounded like the coolest cats.They epitomized some of the classic aesthetics of hip-hop that we embrace . 
Alsoon stage they had a DJ [ Sammy B ] who was the sound provider and I kind of likenmyself to him because he was n't a flashy DJ , but he was the bedrock for theirtwo MCs [ <PERSON>Mike G</PERSON> and Baby Bam ] , and that 's how I conceptualize my role . 
" The MCs in the Poem-Cees do have classic tag-team chemistry and vintageshowmanship . 
" We always have fun in performance , " Black Picasso says . 
" We 'll crack jokes , have you rolling in the aisles , hopefully have you singing along . 
People are notused to smiling or laughing at a hip-hop show -- you want to pull your hat downover your head and nod and dance with an angry expression . 
That 's not where weare so that 's where the contrast comes in . " 
" Paranoia , " it should be noted , does not reflect that particular approach . " 
' Paranoia ' was <PERSON>Patrick</PERSON> 's brainchild concept , showing more of our odd and twistedside , " Stylus says . 
Indeed , " Paranoia " examines some seriously downbeat themes . 
" Keloid Suite " looks at childhood sexual abuse , while " Jay " is a classic hip-hopstory rhyme involving parents ' worst nightmares about their children in achaotic world of drugs and violence . 
There 's also the clever pairing of " SIWBY ( Commitment ) " and " . . . Cheatin ' on Me . " 
The first is a serious , extremelysharp dialogue between two males ( <ORGANIZATION>Naturalaw</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>W. Ellington Felton</ORGANIZATION> ) in which arelationship gets chilled by increasingly cold feet . 
" A lot of our peers are settled down or married or both , " notes Stylus , whoworks with washingtonpost.com 's entertainment guide and MP3 site during the day , " and it 's a conversation you hear when you 're chillin ' with your boys . 
' Cheatin '' is about flipping when she cheats , so we go from mature contemplation to blindmanic rage about a relationship . 
" The album 's strongest track may be " Glasses , " built on Stylus 's forebodingmusic . 
It looks at surprising twists of fate , including the <DATE>2000</DATE> shooting deathof <ORGANIZATION>Howard University</ORGANIZATION> student Prince Jones by <PERSON>Carlton B. Jones</PERSON> , an undercoverofficer with the <ORGANIZATION>Prince George 's County Police Department</ORGANIZATION> . 
After a 10-monthinvestigation , <ORGANIZATION>the Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> cleared the officer of criminalwrongdoing , finding he acted in self-defense and used reasonable force when hefired 16 rounds into the student 's Jeep Cherokee , hitting Prince Jones fivetimes in the back . 
" It seemed to me that was a story that did n't get enough attention , that peoplehad forgotten about it , and I wanted that to be one of the first things Iaddressed on the CD , " says <PERSON>Black Picasso</PERSON> , who has a full-time job as adispatcher for the <ORGANIZATION>Prince George 's County Police Department</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I 've been working at my job for over 10 years , " he says . 
" I 've seen a lot ofthings that I do n't agree with , but I ca n't be as vocal about it on the job asI 'd like to be , so this is kind of where I let it out . 
I expect to hear things , but more indirectly . 
" For tonight 's show , the Poem-Cees will expand to include a five-piece band , butthey also perform as a trio or , as on <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> , a duo . 
According to <ORGANIZATION>Naturalaw</ORGANIZATION> , " It ' scost issues as much as anything : We 've kind of been forced to continue doingthat even though the band thing is what we really want to do . 
We 're willing tohit in all formats . 
When we tour , we still do open mics , get on the list likeeverybody else and tell them we have a show and where we 're at . 
Beingmultifaceted has allowed us to touch people who ordinarily would n't even messaround with hip-hop , " particularly the adventurous hip-hop the Poem-Cees haverefined over the last few years . 
" I always tell people we did not invent the melding of poetry and hip-hop , " Naturalaw says , " but we 've definitely innovated it , I feel . 
There are not a lotof people doing what we can do . 
Black <PERSON>Picasso</PERSON> said the other day that , like whenyou 're diving , we go for the difficulty points . 
We may hit them , we may not , butyou know that we 're trying something that has n't been done before .
