On an overcast <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> , <PERSON>Darlene Turner</PERSON> gathered up her husband and twoteenage sons for a drive from their home in <ORGANIZATION>Brandywine</ORGANIZATION> to President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> ' sOrganizing for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> campaign officein <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> , some 50 miles away . 
Along withdozens of other Prince <PERSON>George</PERSON> 's County residents who made the trip , the Turnersreceived maps of the <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> neighborhoods where they would spend the dayknocking on doors and registering voters . 
" When I received an e-mail alert from the <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> campaign saying <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> wouldbe helping to get our neighbors in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> registered for <DATE>November</DATE> , I wanted toparticipate , " said <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> , a security clearance investigator . 
" Republicans aretrying to turn back the clock on civil rights , women 's rights , human rights , andI do n't want my children to have to say that their mother and father just stoodby and let it happen . 
" To hear Turner speak with such passion , you 'd think that the presidentialelection was being held on Super <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> . 
There are 10 Republican primaries - including <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's - slated for that day . 
But <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> and other volunteers arelooking ahead with a time-compressing urgency , sensing that there is not amoment to lose in preparing for a contest billed as a battle for the future ofAmerica.The choices are clear , with the contrasting views of progressives andreactionaries on display in their own back yard . 
On <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , while <ORGANIZATION>MarylandGov</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Martin O'Malley</PERSON> ( D ) was signing a bill allowing same-sex marriage in thestate , the Republican-led <ORGANIZATION>Virginia General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> was passing a bill requiringwomen to have ultrasounds before abortions.Only after thousands of women staged one of the largest protests in Virginiahistorydid the legislators drop a provision in the bill that specified invasive , transvaginal ultrasounds . 
They also relented and exempted victims of rape andincest from the mandatory procedure.The lawmakers are still considering a proposal that would require Virginiaresidents to show a photo ID before being allowed to vote - a measure that reeksof <PERSON>Jim Crow-era</PERSON> efforts to suppress the black vote . 
" What had been enthusiasm among our volunteers has become determination , " saidLeathia West , a <LOCATION>Beltsville</LOCATION> resident who volunteers as regional director for theObama campaign in <ORGANIZATION>Prince George 's</ORGANIZATION> . 
" People are responding from the heart , fromthe gut , saying that the stakes are too high and that they have to getinvolved . 
" During the <DATE>weekend</DATE> , <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> supporters held more than 100 campaign events inVirginia , many of them supported by volunteers from <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> and the District.Since he announced his bid for reelection in <DATE>April</DATE> , the campaign has hostedabout 6,500 events in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and made more than 370,000 calls to potentialvoters and volunteers.Although <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> won <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> in <DATE>2008</DATE> , the subsequent rise of ultraconservativetea party activists means that he will have to fight even harder to win thisimportant battleground state - with its 13 electoral votes - a second time.Former <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> governor <PERSON>Mitt Romney</PERSON> , one of the main contenders for theRepublican nomination , has virtually no volunteers in the state . 
But he can makeup for the late start in part with his super - PAC-financed advertisingapparatus , infamously known as the " Death Star . " 
As Romney demonstrated duringthe <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> primary , a barrage of well-placed negative ads does n't take long toobliterate a rival.The <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> campaign will be relying heavily on volunteers such as Turner tocounter the threat . 
She does n't campaign so much as chat with residents , helpingthem register to vote and sharing personal stories about issues that will bedebated before the election . 
" I 'm one of those women who had to take birth control pills because of a medicalissue , " <PERSON>Turner</PERSON> told me . 
" I did n't grow up with a silver spoon in my mouth , so Ihad to go to a government clinic to get treatment and prescriptions . 
When I hearmen threatening to cut back on health services for women , attacking ourreproductive rights and even hurling personal insults , I am appalled . 
" Her husband , <PERSON>Kelvin</PERSON> , manages a warehouse and sometimes complained about what hethought were unreasonable demands from labor unions - another issue in thecampaign . 
" I came to see his point , " <PERSON>Darlene Turner</PERSON> said . 
" But I used to be a socialworker , and I know from the people I 've met what it 's like to live at the mercyof callous employers , where you ca n't have an opinion or speak out withoutputting your job in jeopardy . 
And he came to see my point . 
" The Turners had knocked on 55 doors before calling it a day . 
But there werefewer than 245 days before the <DATE>November</DATE> election and , as far as <PERSON>Darlene Turnerwas</PERSON> concerned , many more doors to go.milloyc@washpost.comTo read previous columns by <PERSON>Courtland Milloy</PERSON> , go to washingtonpost.com/milloy .
