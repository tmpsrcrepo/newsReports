For days , Monsignor <PERSON>John Enzler</PERSON> has tried to find the right words.He has sat in his study , deep within the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament inNorthwest <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , with scripture in hand and the latest news on his mind , trying to figure out what , if anything , he will say to his parish about theclergy sex-abuse scandal sweeping across Europe.It is a question playing out in parishes across the country as millions ofCatholics head to church to celebrate Good <DATE>Friday</DATE> and Easter , the holiest daysin the Christian calendar . 
But this year 's observances will be held in theshadow of one of the darkest church scandals in modern history.As a parish priest , the church figure closest to everyday Catholics , do youavoid the subject altogether ? 
Do you slip it into the Good <DATE>Friday</DATE> bulletin ? 
Ormeet it head-on with an Easter sermon ? 
" The thing is , this is not exactly what people expect on Easter , " sighed Enzler , whose high-profile congregants include " Hardball " host <PERSON>Chris Matthews</PERSON> andconservative commentator <PERSON>Patrick J. Buchanan</PERSON> . 
" They come dressed in their <LOCATION>Easterfinery</LOCATION> , having gone through the Lenten season , excited about the coming joy . 
Tohear this kind of a message would be pretty rough . 
" To not address it , however , could alienate those on the fence -- those withdoubts , who want answers , honesty and transparency from the church . 
To saynothing , Enzler worried , leaves the question hanging in the air , an opening tobe filled by critics and negative stories in the media.For weeks , the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> was largely silent as the furor over casesinvolving thousands of children in <LOCATION>Ireland</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION>Europegrew</LOCATION> and led to questions about <PERSON>Pope Benedict XVI</PERSON> 's handling of such abusesduring his time as a high-ranking cardinal.Now the church is mounting a massive public relations offensive against suchallegations and against the continuing barrage of media reports andinvestigations . 
This week , high-ranking officials -- including the pope ' ssuccessor as head of the <ORGANIZATION>Congregation</ORGANIZATION> for the Doctrine of the Faith and a churchofficial who was involved in a case against a <LOCATION>Milwaukee</LOCATION> priest accused ofmolesting 200 deaf children -- have gone on the attack , challenging news reportsas inaccurate and portraying them as a smear campaign against the Holy See.The pope , <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Archbishop <PERSON>Tim Dolan</PERSON> said during a Palm <DATE>Sunday</DATE> homily , was " suffering some of the same unjust accusations , shouts of the mob and scourgingat the pillar as did Jesus . 
" On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops</ORGANIZATION> issued a letter backing thepope , emphasizing his support for victims and reforms after sex-abuse scandalserupted in American dioceses . 
And <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> , <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Archbishop DonaldW . 
Wuerl included a similar message in his homily.But not all Catholics have leapt to the church 's defense . 
The Rev. <PERSON>Thomas Reese</PERSON> , a scholar at <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown University</ORGANIZATION> , said the suffering-Jesus metaphor might bemore fittingly applied to the victims of abuse . 
Reese , who spent the weekanalyzing the church 's crisis and preparing a Good <DATE>Friday</DATE> message for hischapel , said he asked himself , " Who among us has experienced the betrayal , suffering and torture Jesus felt more than the victims ? 
" To drive home that point , victim advocates are planning a Good <DATE>Friday</DATE> event infront of the <ORGANIZATION>Cathedral of St. Matthew</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . 
" A vigil , not a protest . 
. 
. 
It is a sacred day , after all , " said organizer <PERSON>Jessica Lillie</PERSON> . 
" But GoodFriday is a day of sorrow , and we want the church to stop hiding the sorrow ofvictims . 
" Meanwhile , caught in the midst of this Holy Week war of words are therank-and-file priests who have struggled with how to address the growing scandalwith their parishioners . 
" It 's painful to hear it all as a priest . 
It 's a sadness beyond words , " saidMonsignor <PERSON>Robert Panke</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>St. Patrick Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , who decided that he would not bring it up during Mass this week . 
" In some ways , after all we 've gone through in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> , it feels like bybringing it up again we are discounting all the good work and changes that havetaken place the past few years , " he said . 
" And I 'm not sure if it 's spirituallyfruitful to focus on that during Easter . 
" The Rev. <PERSON>Gerard Creedon</PERSON> of St. <PERSON>Charles Borromeo</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Arlington County</LOCATION> came to theopposite conclusion . 
" Silence is inadequate in a situation like this , " he said . 
" Trying to be as honest as we can , acknowledging the problem is what 's needed tobe an open church . 
" For weeks at the Shrine of the <ORGANIZATION>Most Blessed Sacrament</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Enzler</PERSON> said nothing . 
Thenon <DATE>Monday</DATE> , four mothers in his parish -- recent converts with 10 children amongthem -- asked what he thought of the scandals . 
You need to say something , theytold him . 
The topic was on the mind of every Catholic across the country . 
It wasthe elephant in every chapel hall , at every Mass.The next morning , troubled by the conversation , Enzler began thinking aboutreferring to it in the Easter bulletin . 
Working with his secretary in thechurch 's old offices , he wrote and rewrote three sentences for the Pastor ' sCorner segment of the bulletin . 
" I wanted to be careful to say it well , to say it right , " <PERSON>Enzler</PERSON> said . 
The firstversion was too heavy on apology . 
" You want to admit that the church is n'tperfect , but the last thing you want is to add fuel to the fire . 
" This was the crux , he realized , in which the church found itself : It needed toadmit missteps , but worried that by doing so , it would fall prey to theaccusations of its critics.With almost four decades in the priesthood , Enzler recalled that some of hismost powerful sermons were ones in which he let down his guard and becamevulnerable with his flock . 
By sharing his struggles , he thought , hisparishioners could see the true heart of the church and its priests . 
They , too , struggle at times with mistakes . 
They , too , agonize over how to fix them . 
They , too , need grace and prayer.In the end , he settled on this phrasing : " I think it is fair to say that thechild abuse issue has not always been handled well by the church . 
Today I prayfor all victims of abuse , their families and the <ORGANIZATION>Church</ORGANIZATION> . 
Amidst our shared pain , we gather in hope and prayer and , yes , the spirit of the Resurrection . 
" And after a few more days of reflection , <PERSON>Enzler</PERSON> has decided that he must alsofind a way to address the issue in his Easter homily . 
He knows Easter will drawone of the year 's biggest turnouts -- as many as 4,500 at his large , activeparish . 
The crowd will include Catholics he sees only once or twice a year , those at the edge of their faith , floundering and questioning the <ORGANIZATION>Church</ORGANIZATION> . 
" They are the ones I worry about most , " he said in his office this week . 
" Theyare the ones who most need to hear that , yes , as a Church , we are far fromperfect , but there is an honest , concerted effort to address this . 
" And so , with Easter near , he sits in his study , deep in the recesses of thechurch , praying that the right words will come.For more on religion , go to http://www.washingtonpost.com/onfaith .
