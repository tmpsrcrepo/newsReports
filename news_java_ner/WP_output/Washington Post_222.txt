<LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> - <PERSON>Edward Klein</PERSON> was in his 11th year as editor of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> TimesMagazine when on two consecutive weeks in <DATE>July 1987</DATE> the prestigious Sundaysupplement was cited in editors ' notes for lapses in editorial judgment . 
DuringKlein 's tenure the magazine had some notable successes , such as winning aPulitzer Prize , but it also suffered other high-profile missteps , includingpublication of a fabricated tale about <ORGANIZATION>Khmer Rouge</ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in Cambodia.By <DATE>October 1987</DATE> , <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> had departed from the newspaper , and thus began hisjourney from influential editor to conservative author of bestsellers aboutpowerful figures : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HWZ38U?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-books-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B000HWZ38U " title = " www.amazon.com-URL-the Kennedys , http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307353516?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-books-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0307353516 " title = " www.amazon.com-URL-Katie <PERSON>Couric</PERSON> , http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hillary-rodham-clinton/gIQA1F624O_topic.html " title = " www.washingtonpost.com-URL-Hillary <PERSON>Rodham Clinton</PERSON> and , most recently , http://www.washingtonpost.com/barack-obamas-2012-reelection-campaign/gIQAVODn7O_topic.html " title = " www.washingtonpost.com-URL-President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> . 
The evolution of his careerhas raised eyebrows among liberals and conservatives , and the highly personalportraits he crafts have prompted questions about sourcing , accuracy and intent.His latest , " http://www.amazon.com/The-Amateur-Edward-Klein/dp/1596987855/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1340133730&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Amateur-URL-The Amateur , " in which hecontends that the president is ill-suited by experience and temperament tooccupy the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> , contains scenes that did not occur or that were vastlymisconstrued , according to those who <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> says were present . 
The <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> book , released by conservative publisher <ORGANIZATION>Regnery</ORGANIZATION> , has been largely ignored by themainstream media . 
Nonetheless , it has sold vigorously thanks in large part to anearly boost from conservative blogger <PERSON>Matt Drudge</PERSON> . 
It will perch at No. 1 on <ORGANIZATION>theNew York Times</ORGANIZATION> bestseller list <DATE>Sunday</DATE> for the fourth consecutive week . 
In themonth since its <DATE>mid-May</DATE> release , nearly 66,000 copies have been sold , accordingto <ORGANIZATION>Nielsen BookScan.A</ORGANIZATION> pugilist in print , <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> in person is a well-mannered , fit-looking 75-year-oldwho chooses his words carefully and yields little when challenged . 
He satrecently for a 21 / 2-hour interview in his Park Avenue apartment , interruptedonly by his white-uniformed maid delivering coffee and water on a silver tray . 
" If there 's criticism of my work that 's legitimate , " he said , " I 'm ready to hearof it . 
" <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> is no stranger to criticism . 
The uproar over his <DATE>2005</DATE> book about <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> , " http://www.amazon.com/The-Truth-About-Hillary-President/dp/B000HD1OV4/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1340133957&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Truth+About+Hillary-URL-TheTruth About Hillary , " rang out from all quarters . 
One of the most talked-aboutsuggestions in the book was that <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> raped <PERSON>Hillary</PERSON> , an act that led tothe birth of their daughter , <LOCATION>Chelsea</LOCATION> . 
Klein never states outright that a rapeoccurred , but he fashions a scene , based on what he claims are two anonymoussources , that leaves an impression of violence and sex.The scene begins with a drunk Bill telling friends , " I 'm going back to mycottage to rape my wife . " 
The book was so inflammatory - it also suggestivelypainted an environment of lesbianism around <PERSON>Hillary</PERSON> - that some of <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> ' sconservative allies parted ways with him.Political strategist <PERSON>Dick Morris</PERSON> , no friend of <ORGANIZATION>Hillary</ORGANIZATION> 's , wrote in the Hill in2005 , " These accusations do not belong in our public dialogue . " 
Morris declinedto comment on <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> 's latest publication.Conservative columnist and editor <PERSON>John Podhoretz</PERSON> was disgusted by the HillaryClinton book . 
" This is one of the most sordid volumes I have ever waded through , " he wrote inthe <LOCATION>New York Post</LOCATION> . 
" Thirty pages into it , I wanted to take a shower . 
Sixty pagesinto it , I wanted to be decontaminated . 
" Media Matters in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , a progressive outlet that monitors conservative media , produced an exhaustive http://mediamatters.org/research/200506230001 " title = " mediamatters.org-URL-report on alleged inaccuracies , fabrications andinnuendo in the book . 
Both the mainstream and conservative media showed littleinterest in speaking to <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> . 
Seven years after the outcry , <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> defends theveracity of the work : " I have n't said this yet , and I think I will say it . 
Istand by every word in the Hillary book to this day . 
" <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> insists he maintains the highest journalistic standards ; he says he doesnot publish a fact unless at least two sources corroborate it . 
He is so adamantabout these principles that the first line of his current bestseller reads , " This is a reporter 's book . 
" As in his previous books , his literary style in this one leans more toward therhetorical than analytical . 
" The Amateur " repeats long-standing conservativeopinions about <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> - that he is a Muslim , a closet socialist and riddled withdelusions of grandeur . 
" <PERSON>Ed Klein</PERSON> has a proven history of reckless fabrication in order to sell books , " said <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Eric Schultz</PERSON> . 
" Nobody in their right mind wouldbelieve the nonsense in this one . 
" The umbrella theme - that <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> is an amateur in the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> - isestablished in a prologue that claims to depict a scene in <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> 's officeat his home in <LOCATION>Chappaqua</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> draws a portrait of a heated <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> - " hisnose was turning shades of red " - demanding that Hillary challenge the sittingpresident in this year 's election . " 
' The country needs us ! ' 
he shouted , banging a fist on his desk , " <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> writes , basing his account on anonymous witnesses . 
Bill rattles off the reasons Hillaryis a better candidate than <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> - strong secret polling numbers and thepresident 's incompetence - leading to the outburst that frames the book : " BarackObama is an amateur ! 
" <PERSON>Philippe Reines</PERSON> , a <PERSON>Hillary Clinton</PERSON> aide and deputy assistant secretary of state , worked on efforts to debunk many of the claims in " The Truth About Hillary " andsees a pattern of imagined scene-setting recurring in <LOCATION>Klein</LOCATION> 's latest work . 
Ofthe <LOCATION>Chappaqua</LOCATION> incident , he said : " It 's completely fabricated . . . . At the endof the day , he 's nothing more than a congenital liar who believes if at firstyou do n't succeed , lie , lie again . 
" In <DATE>June 2009</DATE> , <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> invited a group of nine eminent historians to the <ORGANIZATION>WhiteHouse</ORGANIZATION> for dinner and an off-the-record discussion of presidential history , anevening <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> re-creates in " The Amateur " based apparently on one anonymoushistorian who attended and left disillusioned with his host . 
In <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> 's telling , <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> regaled the historians with a long list of his intended accomplishments aspresident . 
" It was , by any measure , " <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> concludes , " a breathtaking display ofnarcissistic grandiosity . 
" <PERSON>Douglas Brinkley</PERSON> , a history professor at <ORGANIZATION>Rice University</ORGANIZATION> and an author , mostrecently of ahttp : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061374261?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-books-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0061374261 " title = " www.amazon.com-URL-biography of <PERSON>Walter Cronkite</PERSON> , attended the meeting . 
Hedescribes it as a casual history book club discussion - the president did notgrandstand about his ambitions , nor did he discuss policy . 
" It was more to talk about other presidents , not himself , " <PERSON>Brinkley</PERSON> recalled . 
" Ifound the president to be breathtakingly humble . " 
<PERSON>Brinkley</PERSON> said he wasdisappointed that <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> " inflated and twisted and distorted " the meeting . 
" Itsounds like a ' <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>Night</TIME> Live ' skit of the reality . 
It 's nonsensical . 
" Not only that , <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> misidentified the Rice historian , calling him DavidBrinkley , the celebrated television news broadcaster who died in <DATE>2003</DATE> . 
During the meeting , <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> writes , <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> tried out a new slogan for hisadministration . 
" I 'm thinking of calling it ' A New Foundation , ' " <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> quotes the president assaying.Doris <PERSON>Kearns Goodwin</PERSON> discouraged the use of the motto . 
" It sounds , " Goodwinsaid , according to <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> , " like a woman 's girdle . 
" Neither <PERSON>Brinkley</PERSON> nor another participating historian , who spoke on the conditionof anonymity because of the privacy of the meeting , recalled any mention of " ANew Foundation . " 
<PERSON>Goodwin</PERSON> did not respond to a request for clarification.Klein 's mainstream media credentials run deep . 
Before moving to the Times , hewas foreign editor and assistant managing editor at <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Edward Kosner</PERSON> , theformer editor of <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> and a longtime friend of <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> 's , described the authoras " a very serious-minded , ambitious and industrious person . " 
Referring to thework <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> did nearly 40 years ago , <PERSON>Kosner</PERSON> added , " I had every confidence in himas a journalist when he worked for me . " 
He did not remember <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> as being " extraordinarily conservative " at the time . 
" I think we were all kind ofmiddle-of-the-road , slightly liberal at <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> in those days . 
" <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> describes his departure from the Times as the result of a difference ofopinion about the direction of the magazine with newly installed executiveeditor <PERSON>Max Frankel</PERSON> . 
In a phone interview , <PERSON>Frankel</PERSON> said the two mistakes in July1987 were not necessarily the reason for <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> 's ouster , adding : " It was aseries of things - his judgment and his style of operation and his taste instories . 
We just completely lost confidence in him . " 
Having watched <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> ' ssubsequent literary career , <PERSON>Frankel</PERSON> added , " None of those books are the kindthat normally you 'd expect a <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> person to produce . 
" His former colleagues wonder how he emerged as a combative conservativetargeting powerful liberals . 
<PERSON>Klein</PERSON> acknowledges hawkish sentiments as far backas the <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> War , but while working at <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> and the Times he realized that " it was not my business to push my personal ideology through the pages . 
" He believes he has suffered not only for turning his back on the mainstreammedia world but also for succeeding as an outsider in the exclusive realm ofconservative commentary . 
The left reviles him , and the right has yet to embracehim . 
But for a guy who can take a punch in the blood sport of politics , Kleinseems to relish standing tall in the ring , waving his best-selling books : " From the conservative point of view I 'm a liberal , and from the liberal pointof view I 'm a conservative , and not being able to pigeonhole me has created alot of jealousy and anger .
