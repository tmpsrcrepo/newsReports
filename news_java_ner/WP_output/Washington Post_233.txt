A flesh-baring swim in the Sea of <LOCATION>Galilee</LOCATION> <DATE>last year</DATE> earned Rep. <PERSON>Kevin Yoder</PERSON> ( R-Kan . ) 
a rebuke from <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> leaders . 
But he http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/kansas-rep-apologizes-for-nude-dip-in-holy-sea/2012/08/21/8c006c6c-2b93-4304-89b2-46c34b35df4a_video.htmlgot support from the <ORGANIZATION>American Association forNude Recreation</ORGANIZATION> ( " The credible voice of reason for nude recreation since <DATE>1931</DATE> " ) . 
" Congressman <PERSON>Yoder</PERSON> is a typical American who enjoys skinny-dipping , " the AANRsays in a news release . 
The nudist lobby says <PERSON>Yoder</PERSON> 's antics may help its causeof promoting nude recreation . 
" Overall , the reaction 's been mostly positive , " said <PERSON>Tom Mulhall</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>AANR</ORGANIZATION> ' spublic relations chairman and the owner of the <ORGANIZATION>Terra Cotta Inn</ORGANIZATION> , aclothing-optional resort in <LOCATION>Palm</LOCATION> Springs.The <ORGANIZATION>AANR</ORGANIZATION> 's release lists American presidents purported to have enjoyed a nudesplash : <PERSON>John Quincy Adams</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Teddy Roosevelt</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON> , <PERSON>Lyndon Johnson andGeorge W. Bush</PERSON> . 
( <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's supposed bare romp was technically in a sauna , not abody of water , but we 're not quibbling . ) 
" President <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> even went skinny-dipping while in office with evangelistBilly <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> , " the group reports . 
Sadly , we have no photos.Apply now!Desperate for that post-election call from President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> or President <PERSON>Romneyoffering</PERSON> you a senior administration job?Are you ready to spend countless hours filling out multiple questionnaires - notto mention thousands of dollars on an accountant to help with your financialdisclosure forms?Don ' t despair . 
There are signs that some rationality may prevail on the absurdand endless paperwork for nominees , a mindless one-size-fits-all formula - oneform for the covert-ops chief at <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> , the same one for the assistant secretaryof commerce for widget production.A bipartisan bill that became law earlier this month streamlines or reducesconfirmation requirements for about <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of the positions now needingcommittee hearings and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> floor votes.That should ensure that incoming department heads no longer have that " homealone " problem for weeks or often months waiting for their deputies.The new law also establishes a " Working Group on Streamlining Paperwork forExecutive Nominations . 
" True , these " committees-to-study " most always amount to little more thancan-kickers . 
Still , there 's a bipartisan <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> bloc - from the top leadershipdown - actually committed to improving the system . 
( That 's how the bill passedthe <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> 79 to 20 in the first place . ) 
The working group includes folks from <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> personnel , the <ORGANIZATION>Office ofPersonnel Management</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Government Ethicsas</ORGANIZATION> well asofficials from prior administrations and , one would presume , some people withstrong ties to both parties in the Senate.One goal is to develop a " smart form " that all nominees would fill out withbasic data that would be used by both the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> . 
( <ORGANIZATION>Nomineesnow</ORGANIZATION> have to provide duplicate information on different sets of forms . ) 
Another goal is to accelerate background investigations , which can take fourmonths or more , by seeing whether " non-FBI personnel " can be used to conductmost checks.The legislation asks the working group to explore ways to vary background checks " depending on the sensitivity of the position . " 
So a narrower check on thewidget producer , a broader one for intelligence chiefs.And the group is to develop an " electronic system " for collecting anddistributing information on nominees.The system is so cumbersome now because everyone involved is afraid they mayfind out that their nominee for immigration enforcement has a " nanny problem " orthat the nominee for tax compliance owes back taxes.It 's gotten to the point where " risk avoidance has become more costly than therisk you 're trying to avoid , " observed <PERSON>Max Stier</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>Partnershipfor Public Service</ORGANIZATION> . 
The need is to " manage risk , not avoid risk , " he said . 
" Youca n't avoid risk . 
" The guy worked where?President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's campaign just loves to refer to <PERSON>Mitt Romney</PERSON> 's tenure at <ORGANIZATION>BainCapital</ORGANIZATION> . 
It has made plenty of hay out of the Republican presidentialcandidate 's time with the company ( home of the " vulture capitalists " ! ) 
andmentions it at every opporunity . 
Except one.The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> dared not utter the B-word when <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> named <PERSON>Boris Bershteyntostep</PERSON> in to head the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs</ORGANIZATION> , andBershteyn 's officialhttp : / / www.washingtonpost.com/cass-sunstein-top-obama-adviser-on-regulations-to-leave-administration/2012/08/03/5652b6fc-dd6a-11e1-8e43-4a3c4375504a_story.html bio makes no mention ofBershteyn 's time at the consulting firm <ORGANIZATION>Bain & Co</ORGANIZATION> . 
That 's where Romney workedbefore founding the spinoff private-equity firm Bain Capital.According to his LinkedIn profile , <PERSON>Bershteyn</PERSON> was an associate consultant at <ORGANIZATION>Bain & Co.</ORGANIZATION> in the early <DATE>2000s</DATE> , before he got his <ORGANIZATION>Yale law degree.An Office of Management and Budget</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman noted the distinction <ORGANIZATION>betweenBain & Co.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Bain Capital</ORGANIZATION> and pointed out that <PERSON>Bershteyn</PERSON> 's time at <ORGANIZATION>Bain</ORGANIZATION> wasearly in his career . 
She also said the official bio highlights <PERSON>Bershteyn</PERSON> 's legalexperience , not his consulting background - and so , apparently , it was left offfor editing reasons , not political ones.Still , the <ORGANIZATION>Bain</ORGANIZATION> connection has some chuckling about how anyone with a stint atBain on his or her rsum is probably not highlighting it at the moment . 
Ribbingis inevitable . 
" He seems like a perfect regulatory czar - in a <ORGANIZATION>Romney White House</ORGANIZATION> , " quips CleanAir Watch President <PERSON>Frank O'Donnell</PERSON> . 
Peace outPeace <ORGANIZATION>Corps</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Aaron Williams</PERSON> announced his resignation <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , citingthe standard " personal and family considerations . " 
In a statement , <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> praisedhis efforts " reforming and modernizing the agency " and called him " a champion ofthe thousands of remarkable <ORGANIZATION>Peace Corps Volunteers</ORGANIZATION> serving across the globe . 
" <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> 's three-year tenure was marred by criticism of the agency 's handling ofsexual assaults against volunteers , though we hear his decision to leave caughtmany in the agency by surprise.With Emily Heilkamena@washpost.comThe blog : washingtonpost.com/intheloop .
