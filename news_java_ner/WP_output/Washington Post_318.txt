Is this it?Is the product you are accustomed to holding in your hands a relic , soon to gothe way of silent movies and manual typewriters?I have been one of the industry 's most fervent optimists , convinced thatsomehow , some way , newspapers would find a path to survival . 
But the last fewweeks have shaken my belief , suggesting that what I find indispensable -- adaily compendium delivered to your doorstep -- may be left behind by history andpublic indifference.The bleak future becomes clear when one paper after another whacks a third ormore of its staff -- the <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> Sun is just the latest -- and the <ORGANIZATION>New YorkTimes Co.</ORGANIZATION> threatens to shut down the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Globe</ORGANIZATION> before settling for painfulcutbacks . 
This is not some temporary downturn ; these jobs are gone <PERSON>forever.Warren Buffett</PERSON> , who reads five newspapers a day , now sees the possibility of " just unending losses " and says he would n't buy one at any price . 
The legendaryinvestor is not just very wealthy but owns the <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo News</ORGANIZATION> and a chunk of TheWashington Post Co.The people who run such companies bear a considerable share of the blame . 
In1993 , just before the Internet became a consumer force , I argued in a book thatnewspapers had become too cautious , too incremental and too dull , tailoredlargely for insiders . 
The rise of hugely profitable monopoly papers in mostcities made them increasingly bland , seemingly allergic to controversy.Then the Net changed <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , but newspapers remained mired in two-dimensionalthinking . 
They created sites that were largely a static replica of their printeditions . 
There was little updating , little sense of the dynamism of the Web , and when I started writing a blog for washingtonpost.com in <DATE>2000</DATE> , I had littlecompany in the mainstream media.The missed opportunities were endless . 
For the first time in half a century , newspapers could compete against television with real-time reporting , butdid n't . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Globe</ORGANIZATION> 's previous owners turned down a <DATE>1995</DATE> offer from the founder ofMonster.com to put Globe classifieds online , before his site became a smash hit.Why did no establishment media company create a <ORGANIZATION>Craigslist</ORGANIZATION> , a <ORGANIZATION>Huffington Post</ORGANIZATION> , aGoogle News , a Twitter , or other sites that have altered the boundaries of newsand information?Now that they are belatedly beefing up their Web sites , executives are usingcorporate-speak like " platform-agnostic " to explain why they are firing hordesof journalists suddenly deemed redundant . 
Perhaps newspapers had grown too fatand were always destined to slim down in the Web era , but the mass firings haveabout them an air of desperation . 
How can papers with far smaller staffs andreduced ambitions stem circulation declines?Some high-level people are trying to square the circle . 
Post <ORGANIZATION>Co.</ORGANIZATION> chief executiveDonald <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Google</ORGANIZATION> chief executive <PERSON>Eric Schmidt</PERSON> and their lieutenants havebeen holding talks about a possible collaboration . 
This could range fromcreating new Web pages to technological tools for journalists or readers.Hanging over the talks is the reality that the search giant , while funnelingvital traffic to news sites , vacuums up their content without paying a dime.Post executive <PERSON>Philip Bennett</PERSON> confirmed the discussions , saying : " We 're talkingto each other about improved ways of creating and presenting news online . " 
Hecalls it " an informal collaboration " that " has produced some interesting ideasalready . 
I 'd say that on the journalism side of the conversation we 've learned alot . 
" Oddly enough , newspapers are reaching more people than ever before . 
In <DATE>1999</DATE> , ThePost had a circulation of 786,000 , essentially limited to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and itssuburbs . 
Now the print circulation is 665,000 and The Post 's Web site is drawing9 .4 million unique monthly visitors from around the world.A survey by the <ORGANIZATION>University of Southern California</ORGANIZATION> 's Annenberg center found thatNet users are spending 53 minutes per week reading online newspapers , up from 41minutes in <DATE>2007</DATE> . 
The problem , as you 've undoubtedly heard , is that the printadvertising that has supported sizable newsrooms is plunging , while online adsbring in just a fraction of the revenue . 
Combine that with an Internet culturebuilt on free content , and newspapers suddenly find themselves on a starvationdiet.Numerous schemes are being floated , from turning newspapers into nonprofits toseeking foundation grants . 
<PERSON>Steven Brill</PERSON> , the founder of Court TV and the defunctmagazine <ORGANIZATION>Brill 's Content</ORGANIZATION> , has joined with two other former media executives toform Journalism Online . 
He is talking to publishers about a site that wouldallow consumers to easily buy subscriptions , day passes or single articles fromnumerous media organizations , each of which would decide how much to charge andhow much to put behind a pay wall . 
<PERSON>Rupert Murdoch</PERSON> , who is consideringdevelopment of an e-reader that might be better suited to newspapers thanAmazon 's Kindle , also plans to begin charging " micro-payments " for individualarticles on the Wall Street Journal 's subscription-only Web site , the FinancialTimes reports.But what about the old rolled-up , flip-through-the-pages , take-it-on-the-subwayproduct ? 
In a world where the most obscure factoid can be searched in seconds , is most of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> now immune to those charms ? 
With both <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> newspapers inbankruptcy , that may be the case.Clay <ORGANIZATION>Shirky of New York University</ORGANIZATION> says on his blog that " people committed tosaving newspapers [ are ] demanding to know , ' If the old model is broken , whatwill work in its place ? ' 
To which the answer is : Nothing . 
Nothing will work.There is no general model for newspapers to replace the one the Internet justbroke . 
" Maybe he 's right . 
To recite the wonders of the daily paper -- the serendipitousmixture of serious and playful , plugged-in local columnists , a natural forum forin-depth articles -- is to risk sounding like a fuddy-duddy gentleman preachingthe virtues of ascots and walking sticks.But then there is the reporting . 
In <DATE>2003</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>the Globe</ORGANIZATION> won a Pulitzer Prize forexposing sexual abuse by Roman Catholic priests , a courageous journalistic featthat led to the resignation of <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> 's archbishop and sparked inquiries aroundthe world . 
Can the slimmed-down Globe of the future do such intensive reporting?Could any other media outlet in <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> even attempt such a project?Newspaper folks may have an inflated view of their self-importance , but whatthey do has an impact beyond their readers and advertisers . 
Local TV is n'tlikely to expose a crooked mayor , as the <ORGANIZATION>Detroit Free Press</ORGANIZATION> did . 
Bloggers are n'tgoing to reveal secret <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> prisons . 
" Society does n't need newspapers . 
What we need is journalism , " <PERSON>Shirky</PERSON> argues.That is way too glib . 
The online cacophony that would follow the demise ofnewspapers would be fast , furious and fun , insightful and opinionated . 
But let ' sface it : Who would pay for a <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> bureau , or even a bureau in <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION> orAnnapolis?I still have the buffet mentality , the idea that news , sports , entertainment andso on can make for a tasty package . 
Buffet folks like to get a fill , a briefing , a contextual sense of what 's important . 
But so many others in the iTunes agewould rather cherry-pick , clicking on one story and rushing off , window shopperswho rarely come inside.Newspapers are probably dying as a mass medium , except perhaps for elite orspecialized audiences . 
Cutting down forests , printing the product and truckingit across the region no longer make economic sense . 
What is lost is the sense ofcommunity when everyone read the daily rag.Nothing lasts forever . 
I grew up in the era of tinny AM radios and 45 rpmrecords . 
I 've worked for an afternoon paper that went under , the scrappyWashington Star . 
Maybe serious journalism will reinvent itself in new andunexpected forms . 
But if everything goes electronic , I 'll always miss the feelof newsprint .
