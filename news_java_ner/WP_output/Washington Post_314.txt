<PERSON>Marina Alvarez</PERSON> came by herself to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> from El Salvador at age 16 . 
Fleeing sexual abuse , she was smuggled across the Mexican border to <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> bybus . 
She knew no one . 
She learned English by working in hotels and restaurantsin the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> suburbs . 
She worked days , nights , weekends.Last <DATE>spring</DATE> , she thought she finally had made it : She bought a house in HowardCounty for herself and her two U.S-born children . 
The closing was to be on aMonday . 
On the previous <DATE>Saturday</DATE> , she was heading home from work at <ORGANIZATION>theChesapeake Bay Seafood House</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Arundel Mills</LOCATION> when police pulled her over forfollowing another car too closely . 
When the officer checked her out , up popped adecade-old arrest warrant from federal immigration authorities.Alvarez -- pregnant , with 8-year-old <PERSON>Keyla</PERSON> and 11-year-old <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> waiting forher at home -- was sent to a detention center in <LOCATION>Dorchester County</LOCATION> on theEastern Shore , where she remains today , nearly six months later.The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government expects to deport <PERSON>Alvarez</PERSON> , who is 29 , sometime soon . 
If sheis sent back to her native land , she says , she will not take her children withher . 
Keyla and <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> know no one in <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> , speak little Spanish and have alegal right to stay in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> . 
" Here , they have a future , aneducation , " <PERSON>Alvarez</PERSON> tells me . 
" There , nothing . 
" One possible solution is to send them back where <PERSON>Alvarez</PERSON> came from . 
Another isto put the children 's interests first and let the family stay because the kidsare <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizens . 
Both approaches sound easy , but both are deeply flawed.Marina <PERSON>Alvarez</PERSON> did everything Americans want immigrants to do -- except arrivelegally . 
She never got into trouble , she worked , paid taxes , got involved in herchildren 's schooling . 
" She worked her way from homelessness to self-sufficiency , " says <PERSON>VeronicaPeterson</PERSON> , <PERSON>Alvarez</PERSON> 's former child-care provider , who has taken in <LOCATION>Keyla</LOCATION> and Brianwithout compensation . 
Their father is out of the picture , gone . 
" No way I couldhelp her if she was living an illegal 's life , off the books . 
But she dideverything she was supposed to . 
After all these years , I 'd like to think mygovernment would make an exception about her being here against the law . 
" Sorry , says <PERSON>Ira Mehlman</PERSON> , spokesman for the Federation for American ImmigrationReform ( FAIR ) , which pushes for tougher sanctions against illegal immigrants : " Any parent convicted of any offense could employ that same argument , ' Do n'thurt me because you 're going to hurt my kids . ' 
It 's the parent 's responsibilityto deal with the consequences of her own illegal act . 
" The record is clear . 
After she applied for political asylum in the UnitedStates , <PERSON>Alvarez</PERSON> failed to show up at a hearing in <DATE>1996</DATE> . 
In her absence , a judgeordered her deported . 
Alvarez says she never received notice of that hearing ; the envelope containing the notice , marked " Attempted -- Not Known , " sits inher file a decade later . 
But she did know the authorities were looking into hercase : She 'd attended an earlier hearing.An immigration judge has ruled that the government fulfilled its obligation bysending the proper notice . 
Alvarez must go , the court said -- a decision shehas appealed.I asked <PERSON>Alvarez</PERSON> to consider her case as <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizens might view it . 
What is theright thing to do ? 
" I do n't know , " she said . 
" I understand how people feel , and I can not changetheir minds . 
People have lives and children , and they do n't have any choice butto do what they have to for their children . 
" <PERSON>Alvarez</PERSON> says she was repeatedly raped by relatives starting when she was 10 . 
Shesays she had no choice but to leave her home . 
Now , she says , she simply will notput her own children back in that environment.Teachers at <ORGANIZATION>Running Brook Elementary School</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> have rallied aroundAlvarez . 
Administrators took in <LOCATION>Keyla</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> for a while . 
Of all thestruggling parents <PERSON>Marta Goodman</PERSON> , the <LOCATION>Howard County</LOCATION> school 's bilingual communityliaison , has met , " Marina is my most admired , " she says . 
" She has earned anddeserves the right to be in this country . 
" The children , who get to visit their mother one day each month , are " angry , " <PERSON>Peterson</PERSON> says . 
" Keyla wants to get serious about her education because she wantsto become an immigration lawyer so she can protect other children from this.Brian is angry because he 's not in a position to help his mom . 
" In custody , <PERSON>Alvarez</PERSON> spends a lot of time crying . 
" It 's like your heart -- " she stops and hold up her fist -- " your heart is a sponge , and they have it , and they 're squeezing . " 
It hurts , but there 's no question she broke the law.Alvarez 's lawyer , <PERSON>Peter Asaad</PERSON> , says the only way to prevent deportation is toconvince judges that she never got notice of that <DATE>1996</DATE> hearing . 
He believes hercase is a taste of what 's to come if the government adopts a more aggressivedeportation policy . 
" Those kids are citizens like anyone else , " he says . 
" Ifthey stay behind , they could become wards of the state . 
" That 's possible , says <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> immigration spokesman <PERSON>Dean Boyd</PERSON> . 
" We 're obligated tocarry out the judge 's orders . 
That makes some people very unhappy , but that ' sthe law . 
The children are paying for their parent 's transgressions . 
" These kids , living with no parent , are already paying . 
Do n't Americans have anobligation to care for Keyla and <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> as for any other citizens ? 
" We do haveobligations , " says <PERSON>Mehlman</PERSON> of FAIR , " but I 'm not sure they 're greater than theparent 's obligation to take care of their own kids . " 
Mehlman suggests scrappingthe law that grants citizenship to anyone born on our soil . 
But that promise isa big part of what makes this country a land of hope and opportunity.There 's no point in waiting for politicians to get serious about immigrationreform ; they will always choose the path of least resistance . 
Alvarez , meanwhile , will surely do what she has to do . 
If deported , she will find a wayback to her children . 
She 'll get back on that bus to <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> . 
In a way , that ' sthe glory of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> : The real strivers will find their way here.Eugene <PERSON>Sampson</PERSON> will be allowed to stay in his apartment at L'Arche , the grouphome for the mentally disabled in <ORGANIZATION>Adams Morgan</ORGANIZATION> , thanks to <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> Council <PERSON>memberPhil Mendelson</PERSON> , who read my <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> column and pressed two city departments tostop harassing one of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 's most caring charities .
