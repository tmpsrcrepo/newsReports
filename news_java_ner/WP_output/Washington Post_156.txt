<PERSON>John McCain</PERSON> is no silver-tongued orator , as he proved in <LOCATION>St. Paul</LOCATION> , but it 's hardnot to be stirred when he speaks of wanting only to serve a cause greater thanhimself -- until you take a closer look and see that he 's running one of themost egocentric presidential campaigns in memory.Not that <PERSON>Barack Obama</PERSON> lacks a healthy opinion of himself , mind you . 
And no onewants the next president to be paralyzed with insecurity , or to doubt , even fora minute , that he 's the right man for the job . 
But after ridiculing <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> as apreening celebrity , if not a self-proclaimed messiah , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> is campaigning on aplatform that can be summed up in three words : me , me , me.Much has been made of the fact that he 's a Republican running on a pledge toclean up the intolerable , unforgivable mess created over the past eight years bya Republican president -- and , for much of that time , a Republican-controlledCongress in which <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> himself had great power and influence . 
It 's amusing tolisten to a man in his fourth term in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> ( after two terms in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> ) rail against evil " <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , " as if he were n't one of this modern-day Sodom ' smost prominent denizens.There has been less comment , however , on the extent to which <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> rejects notonly his party 's record but also important tenets of its stated philosophy . 
He ' sa Republican who does n't entirely believe in modern Republicanism . 
" We oppose amnesty " for undocumented immigrants , the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> platform says . 
" Therule of law suffers if government policies encourage or reward illegalactivity . " 
Yet <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> co-authored the ill-fated immigration reform bill thatwould have granted de facto amnesty to millions who are in this country withoutthe proper papers . 
" Republicans caution against the doomsday climate change scenarios peddled bythe aficionados of centralized command-and-control government , " the platformsays . 
<PERSON>McCain</PERSON> is with his party on the issue of offshore drilling -- there was asurreal moment in <LOCATION>St. Paul</LOCATION> when delegates were actually chanting " drill , baby , drill " -- but he has tried his best to sound more like a Democrat inacknowledging the urgency of taking measures to ameliorate global warming.On abortion , the platform is uncompromisingly pro-life and mentions noexceptions for rape or incest ; <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> believes there should indeed beexceptions . 
On embryonic stem-cell research , the platform says no ; <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> saysyes.I 'm not being disingenuous . 
I know that party platforms are n't as important asthey once were . 
But <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's apostasy on these hot-button issues has to beconsidered alongside the stunning charges he leveled against his own party inhis acceptance speech . 
" We were elected to change <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , and we letWashington change us , " he said . 
" We lost the trust of the American people whensome Republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption . . . . We lost theirtrust when we valued our power over our principles . 
" I ca n't argue with any of that . 
Those sound like great reasons to throw theRepublicans out of town and give Democrats a chance to lead . 
But <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON> isarguing that he should be elected in spite of his party 's many failures because , well , he 's <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON> . 
He 's special . 
" I 'm not running for president because I think I 'm blessed with such personalgreatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need , " <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> said in accepting the nomination . 
But this line -- which I took as acontinuation of his attempt to paint <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> as some kind of self-proclaimedChosen One -- came right after a lengthy recounting of the horrors <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> livedthrough as a prisoner of war in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> . 
In effect , he had used his personalexperience to anoint himself.McCain 's speech offered hardly anything in terms of policy . 
At one point , hementioned three " ordinary " families by name and spoke of their travails -- andit was no coincidence that they happened to live in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Pennsylvania andNew Hampshire</LOCATION> , states that <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> would like to steal from the Democrats thisyear . 
But he offered no specifics on how the federal government under a McCainadministration would make these families ' lives one bit better . 
He pledged onlythat he , personally , would " fight " for them.McCain and his campaign aides are right when they insinuate that one candidateis acting as if he thinks voters should accept him , on faith , as their politicalmessiah . 
They 're just trying to make fun of the wrong one.The writer will answer questions at noon today at www.washingtonpost.com .
