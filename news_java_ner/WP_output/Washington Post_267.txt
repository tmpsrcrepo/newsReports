<LOCATION>RICHMOND</LOCATION> - Ask delegates at the state Republican convention here why they admireKen Cuccinelli , their newly official candidate for governor , and the mostfrequent answer is that he 's " a warrior . 
" I 've got no argument with that . 
But before <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> voters cast their ballots inNovember , they have a right to know : a warrior for what?If Cuccinelli is elected , it 's reasonable to expect that he 'd use the powerfulgovernor 's office to fight for the same causes that have made him a hero to the8 ,000 conservative activists here and to the tea party nationwide . 
That wouldmean more high-profile battles against Obamacare , abortion , environmentalprotection and gay rights.But despite <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> 's frequent insistence that he 's a special politician whosticks to his principles and plays straight with the public , the early signs arethat his campaign is trying to distract voters from the very positions that madehim famous.In his acceptance speech <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Richmond Coliseum</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> made onlybrief , passing references to his antiabortion position and his unsuccessfulfight as attorney general against health-care reform.Instead , he went on and on about what he called his top priority of creatingjobs and growing the economy.His first two television ads took a similar approach . 
The first , featuring hiswife , <LOCATION>Teiro</LOCATION> , emphasized that <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> has fought to reduce sexual assaults andhelp the mentally ill and that he once worked the night shift at an ArlingtonCounty homeless shelter . 
The second ad was all about reducing taxes andregulation to make <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> " an engine of job growth . 
" Those are hardly the issues that excite the conventioneers . 
Delegate <PERSON>Mary Powersof Arlington</PERSON> praised Cuccinelli because he 's " such a warrior " to protect theunborn . 
Delegate <PERSON>Elaine Corbo</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Rockingham County</LOCATION> likes him because he " comesout of the gate swinging " on such issues as health care and morality.It 's clear what <ORGANIZATION>Cuccinelli</ORGANIZATION> 's campaign strategy is aiming to do : He and hisadvisers want to copy the model for Republican success in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> used by Gov.Bob <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> four years ago.Like Cuccinelli , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> had a record as an outspoken conservative advocate onsocial issues . 
But <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> deliberately played down those in the campaign . 
Hestressed that he 'd be a pragmatist , especially on the economy andtransportation . 
His slogan , " Bob 's for jobs , " carried him to a landslidevictory.Republicans here praised Cuccinelli for pursuing the same strategy in his raceagainst <PERSON>Terry McAuliffe</PERSON> , former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic National Committee</ORGANIZATION> . 
" <PERSON>Ken</PERSON> gets that at this moment in time , the economy and job creation come first . 
. . . I think that 's going to ameliorate some concerns that people have abouthim , " said <ORGANIZATION>House Del</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Jimmie Massie III</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>Henrico</LOCATION> ) . 
The problem facing undecided voters is that although <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> is campaigninglike <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> , he would n't necessarily govern the same way.To a large extent , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> followed the vision he laid out in his campaign . 
Hepublicly warned fellow Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> against pushingdivisive social issues . 
Although he was criticized for signing a bill requiringwomen to have ultrasounds before having abortions , he also forced the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> toamend the bill to allow women to avoid the most invasive , transvaginal kind ofultrasound.It 's not at all certain that <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> would lean toward the middle like that.He has likened the fight against abortion to the movement to abolish slavery.McDonnell also compromised on one of his signature issues - opposition to highertaxes - when it counted most . 
He agreed to raise gasoline taxes as part of thisyear 's historic package to pay for roads and transit.For all of <ORGANIZATION>Cuccinelli</ORGANIZATION> 's claims to stand for principle and plain speaking , he hassent mixed signals about the transportation bill . 
He strongly opposed it beforeit passed , saying Virginians could n't afford such a massive tax increase . 
Nowhe 's backed off , saying he would n't try to get it repealed.The shift could point to a newfound streak of realism , which I would welcome.But it could also just mask simple opportunism . 
A call for repealing thetransportation tax would split the GOP.McDonnell 's decision to raise taxes was n't popular at all with the delegateshere . 
But many praised the governor , albeit grudgingly , for putting the state ' sinterests above the party 's . 
" In one way , he kind of weighed what was the bigger benefit , " said <PERSON>Howard Hahn</PERSON> , an <LOCATION>Augusta County</LOCATION> delegate . 
<PERSON>Hahn</PERSON> disliked the tax hike but conceded that " weneeded to do something " about transportation.Cuccinelli needs to tell voters squarely whether he 'd be ready to choosepragmatism over ideology in the same way.robert.mccartney@washpost.comFor previous <PERSON>Robert McCartney</PERSON> columns , go to washingtonpost.com/mccartney .
