Complaints of harassment and hostile work environments are on the rise onCapitol Hill , where offices are not required to keep personnel records , providemandatory anti-discrimination training or protect whistleblowers despite forcingother government agencies and private employers to do so , a new report says.Lawmakers collectively employ about 30,000 people working in crammed CapitolHill suites or storefront district offices across the country , and at supportagencies , including the Architect of the Capitol and <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Capitol Police</ORGANIZATION> . 
Abouttwo-thirds of legislative branch employees call the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> area home , according to estimates by the nonpartisan <ORGANIZATION>Office of Compliance</ORGANIZATION> , which monitorscongressional workplace issues.The office 's annual " State of the Congressional Workplace " report , scheduled forrelease <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , finds that a growing number of congressional staff members areseeking advice on how to deal with harassment and discipline issues.By law , congressional staff members may choose to meet with <ORGANIZATION>OOC</ORGANIZATION> officials toreview personnel complaints or mediate workplace disputes , and may pursue claimsin an administrative hearing or refer the case to federal court if theallegations are unresolved.In fiscal <DATE>2010</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>OOC</ORGANIZATION> said it handled 105 new counseling requests and 86 requestsfor mediation , up from previous years , and said it reviewed a higher number ofindividual allegations of harassment and hostile work environments or concernsabout promotions.A majority of the counseling requests came from employees of the Architect ofthe Capitol and <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Capitol Police</ORGANIZATION> , with just <PERCENT>19 percent</PERCENT> of requests promptedby <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> staff members and <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> from <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> employees . 
" These cases are becoming more complex and sophisticated , often with multipleallegations of discrimination , discovery disputes , and issues relating to theOOC 's rules and procedures , " <PERSON>Tamara E. Chrisler</PERSON> , the office 's executivedirector , said in the report.The offices of <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>John A. Boehner</PERSON> ( R-Ohio ) , <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Majority <PERSON>LeaderHarry M. Reid</PERSON> ( D-Nev . ) 
and the <ORGANIZATION>Capitol Police</ORGANIZATION> declined to <PERSON>comment.Eva Malecki</PERSON> , an Architect of the <ORGANIZATION>Capitol</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman , said the growing number ofrequests for counseling from her office are partly because it " encourages itsemployees to use this additional resource to help them resolve workplaceissues . " 
With 2,600 employees , <ORGANIZATION>AOC</ORGANIZATION> is one of the largest congressional agencies , she said.The lower percentage of counseling requests among <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> staff membersis probably because congressional offices do not publicly post information onworker 's rights in the office or require mandatory employment training , according to reports previously published by <ORGANIZATION>OOC</ORGANIZATION> 's board of directors . 
A staffmember 's concerns about potentially disparaging the reputation of a lawmaker orpolitical party also probably keep workers from creating a case file , OOCofficials said.And despite its push to become a player in workplace disputes , OOC is often keptout of some of the Hill 's more salient allegations of harassment ordiscrimination , said lawyer <PERSON>Debra S. Katz</PERSON> , who has handled several employmentdiscrimination cases on Capitol Hill.In more serious cases , " there typically is a discussion of resolution before thecomplaint is even filed , " <PERSON>Katz</PERSON> said . 
" We 've certainly been involved in a numberof situations where the allegations were serious and we were able to resolve itwithout going " to the OOC.As it has in previous years , the report faulted lawmakers for exempting thelegislative branch from significant provisions of national workplace rightslaws . 
Despite laws applying those national workplace standards to thelegislative branch , the report said congressional offices do not keep recordsrequired for the enforcement of some workplace rights laws , do not requireanti-discrimination or anti-retaliation training for employees , and do notprovide protections for workers who report violations or allege cases of waste , fraud and abuse.In the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> , Reps. <PERSON>Dan Lungren</PERSON> ( R-Calif . ) 
and <PERSON>Robert A. Brady</PERSON> ( D-Pa . ) 
, thechairman and ranking member of the <ORGANIZATION>House Administration Committee</ORGANIZATION> , said theyplan to review the report and ensure that staff members understand their rights.ed.okeefe@washingtonpost.com
