Dear Carolyn : I 've been dating " Fred " for six months . 
We enjoy talking about our future.However , I have had a rather sordid past , having been raped twice . 
I neverpressed charges , due to fear of repercussions . 
I have sought counseling and amdefinitely nearing the top of my recovery.Fred and I use condoms , but I do n't want to have to use them forever . 
Freddoes n't feel safe using anything else due to what I might have contracted frommy rapists . 
But what about having children ? 
Should I just accept things andadopt ? 
We understand that serious diseases like HIV can take a long time tosurface . 
I respect his desire for his own safety but can not help feeling judgedfor something that was n't my fault . 
Should I just come to terms with the factthat no one is ever going to accept all of my faults?DistraughtNo . 
Do not come to terms with that . 
No , no , no . 
Especially not if you 're goingto treat your being a two-time rape victim ( egad ) as one of your " faults . " 
Donot come to terms with ignorance.What I see is <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> 's loving himself ( for demanding protection ) and your lovinghim ( for wanting to please him ) . 
I see half the picture is missing.What about his loving you and your loving yourself ? 
Enough to make the one phonecall , the one appointment it takes to learn the true risks you and he face?Where 's your therapist , here?I wo n't get into all of those risks since each potential infection has its ownstory -- but the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control</ORGANIZATION> will . 
You just have to ask it to , by calling its free , 24-hour confidential hotline : 800-227-8922 . 
Here 's a quote from another dazzlingly accessible resource , the <ORGANIZATION>American SocialHealth Association</ORGANIZATION> 's STD site ( www.ashastd.org ) : " Most people infected with HIVwill have detectable antibodies within three months of exposure to HIV . . . . Rarely , it can take up to six months . 
" Three months from your rape , one test -- and if you want the assurance , threemore months , another test -- and you 'd have your answer on your most serioushealth risk , and possibly on forever , on condoms , on kids.And yet you not only torture yourself , you let Fred torture you.That might constitute an answer or two to some other important questions , including whether you really are at the " top " of your recovery.You have much to be proud of for getting counseling -- but take control of yourphysical health , too . 
Meanwhile , emotionally , your staying silent out of fear , and now calling your past " sordid " ( synonyms : disgusting , grubby , foul , filthy ) , suggest you still harbor some shame . 
Your past is not sordid . 
It is brutal , painful , unfair.Next important question is whether Fred deserves your future . 
I loathe themanipulator 's mantra -- " If you love me , you 'll . . . " -- but this occasionwarrants it : If Fred loves you , he will exert the puny effort it takes to getinformed vs. arbitrarily declare you unclean.And if he refuses or even stalls -- or worse , defends his ignorance -- then cometo terms with this , about <PERSON>Fred</PERSON> alone : that he 'd rather fear and isolate you thanbother to find the truth.Write to Tell Me About It , <DATE>Sunday</DATE> Source , <DATE>1150</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>15th St. NW</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> 20071 or tellme@washpost.com, and join <PERSON>Carolyn</PERSON> 's live discussion at noon Fridaysat www.washingtonpost.com/liveonline .
