THE <ORGANIZATION>ASKBy Sam LipsyteFarrar Straus Giroux</ORGANIZATION> . 
296 pp . 
$ 25Here 's <PERSON>Milo Burke</PERSON> , the sad-sack hero of " The Ask , " reflecting on artificialintelligence and computers . 
<PERSON>Maura</PERSON> is his wife : " Some argued that the creation of artificial intelligence amounted to cruel andunusual punishment . 
Consciousness was suffering . 
Why inflict it on a poormachine ? 
I was n't one of those people , but only because I believed that AI wouldsomeday make good on its promise of astonishing robot sex , if not for us , thenfor our children . 
" I was also one of those people who had n't caught up with the latest socialnetworking site . 
Maura belonged to most of them . 
She passed most eveningsbefriending men who had tried to date-rape her in high school . 
" Generally , novels make us turn the pages because we want to know what happensnext . 
But with <PERSON>Sam Lipsyte</PERSON> 's " The Ask , " we turn the pages because we want toknow what 's going to happen in the next sentence . 
Here rants become arias , andvulgarity sheer poetry . 
Lipsyte 's masters are n't Messrs. <PERSON>Strunk</PERSON> and White ; they 're gallows-humored CÃ © line , <PERSON>Hunter S. Thompson</PERSON> at his most gonzo , the greatStanley Elkin.Although " The Ask " is unquestionably funny , it 's by no means essentially comic.Its theme , after all , is loss , often heartbreaking loss . 
In the opening chapter , <PERSON>Milo</PERSON> is fired from his job as a mediocre fundraiser for a mediocre university inNew <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> . 
Once he dreamed of becoming a painter ; now , approaching 40 , hedaydreams about his old college days , his misfit housemates and formergirlfriends . 
Maura , whom he adores , no longer likes to be touched by him , andonly <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON> , their nearly 4-year-old son , seems to be keeping the little familytogether.Listless and drinking too much , <PERSON>Milo</PERSON> is nonetheless suddenly called back to hisformer job . 
The immensely wealthy <PERSON>Purdy Stuart</PERSON> -- a major " ask " -- might bewilling to endow a building or fund a project , but he insists that <PERSON>Milo</PERSON> be thego-between . 
Years ago , the two had been uneasy friends in college , for Purdyalready exuded the sure confidence that comes with a trust fund and an obviousfuture in the ruling class . 
Even back then , <PERSON>Milo</PERSON> was n't precisely upbeat : " For a time I wore only heavy , steel-toed boots because I figured if apocalypticwar broke out , sturdy footwear would be a must . 
Then it dawned on me that thebetter the boots , the more quickly I would be killed for them . 
My only shot atsurvival would be shoeless abjection . 
" When the two meet for lunch , <PERSON>Purdy</PERSON> is tanned and toned , looking like a million , or rather several hundred million . 
He 's married to a former supermodel namedMelinda , a " generically stunning woman . " 
As <PERSON>Milo</PERSON> says : " There were thousands , or at least several hundred , just like her in this partof the city . . . perfect storms of perfect bones , monuments to tone and hairtechnology . 
Around here she was almost ordinary , but you could still picturesmall towns where men might bludgeon their friends , their fathers , just to runtheir sun-cracked lips along her calves . 
" These days , <PERSON>Purdy</PERSON> spends most of his time making deals or jetting off toconferences . 
He calls <PERSON>Milo</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Vail</LOCATION> , where he 's attending " an ideas festival " and sharing his suite " with a gorgeous renewable-energy guru . " 
You should comeout here , <PERSON>Purdy</PERSON> tells his old college bud : " It 's really something . 
I mean , these people , you read their books , theirnewsletters , see them on TV , but to hear them in person , chat with them . 
Veryimpressive . 
Do you realize that someday we will be heating our houses withtrout ? 
" While <PERSON>Purdy</PERSON> dawdles over the exact nature and amount of his " give , " Milo makesends meet by building decks with <PERSON>Nick</PERSON> , a guy with big dreams . 
" He wanted tobreak into television . 
He watched a lot of reality shows , he informed me , especially the ones about breaking into television . " 
Nick has noticed somethingstrange about death-row prisoners : " Bear with me and answer this question . 
Why do these death row losers alwaysorder nuggets and dipping sauce and biggie fries for their last meal ? 
Is it A , they are ghetto or barrio or trailer-park trash who do n't know any better , whocould never imagine a taste sensation transcending that of a Hot Pocket and anorange Fanta , or , B , something else entirely ? 
" Before long , <PERSON>Nick</PERSON> is outlining his idea for " Dead Man Dining , " in which " theworld 's top chefs prepare exquisite last meals for condemned prisoners . " 
Thisseems no more unlikely than the shows <PERSON>Maura</PERSON> and <PERSON>Milo</PERSON> watch together : " We jumped from pundit to pundit , then on to basketball , Albanian cooking , endangered voles , ' <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's Top Topiary Designers , ' ' America 's Toughest Back-UpGenerators , ' ' The Amazing Class Struggle , ' the catfish channel , a show called , simply , ' Airstrikes ! ' 
" Throughout " The Ask , " <PERSON>Lipsyte</PERSON> keeps returning to family life , but particularlyto the relationship between fathers and sons . 
Milo fondly recalls his ownfeckless , skirt-chasing dad and frankly delights in his son , <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON> -- " Boldname , by the way , " <PERSON>Purdy</PERSON> says . 
" You just definitely want him to be anaccountant ? " 
The little boy spends a great deal of his free time " on the sofa , watching his favorite show , the one where children mutated into gooey robots , sneered . 
It was like a parable from a religion based entirely on sarcasm . " 
Thescenes at <PERSON>Bernie</PERSON> 's preschool , the Happy Salamander , are all a hoot.But , then , no group is safe from <PERSON>Lipsyte</PERSON> 's gimlet eye . 
Take the privileged " international teens with their embossed leathers , their cashmere hoodies andpimpled excitements . " 
The disdainful <PERSON>Milo</PERSON> is convinced that these wealthycollege kids from <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> are gaming everybody : " We sponsored them for visas , and when the paperwork went through , theytransferred to one of the online universities , lit out for the territories , <LOCATION>Vegas</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Maui</LOCATION> . 
No classes to attend , all their assignments written bystarving grad students and emailed for grading to shut-in adjuncts scatteredacross the North American landmass , the international teens would have a wholesemester for the most delightful modes of free fall . 
Daddy 's <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> factoriesor Caspian oil pipes would foot the bills . 
" Note the rich fathers in that last sentence . 
As it happens , about this time <PERSON>Miloencounters Don Charboneau</PERSON> , a bitter 21-year-old Iraqi war vet whose legs havebeen blown off and who hobbles around on titanium prostheses . 
Don 's mother , asingle mom , has died suddenly , and it turns out that his father is none otherthan <PERSON>Purdy</PERSON> , whom he utterly despises yet hungers to meet . 
Purdy would like thisancient by-blow to just go away . 
From this point on , " The Ask " grows darker , increasingly fraught.Lost jobs , lost loves , lost fathers , lost hope -- does anything remain ? 
In thesepages , even the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> is regularly deemed a loser nation , metaphorically " slumped in the corner of the pool hall , some gummy coot with a pint of Mad Dogand soggy yellow eyes , just another mark for the juvenile wolves . " 
Purdy 's dyinglawyer , <PERSON>Lee Moss</PERSON> , says straight out , " My grandson 's at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> right now . 
He ' sa dummy . 
But then again most of them are . 
I went to <ORGANIZATION>City College</ORGANIZATION> on the GI Bill.This was back when there was <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
" What else happens in " The Ask " ? 
Do n't ask . 
Because <PERSON>Lipsyte</PERSON> 's firecracker proseis so much fun to read , one can almost overlook all the heartbreak in hisbrilliant novel . 
Almost . 
In the end , the dazzle simply highlights the darknessand the despair.Visit <PERSON>Dirda</PERSON> 's online book discussion at http://washingtonpost.com/readingroom .
