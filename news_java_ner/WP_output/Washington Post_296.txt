During a job interview , applicants expect to be grilled with a lot of questions.Eric <PERSON>Loewenthal</PERSON> , 20 , is ready . 
But he also has a few questions of his own.Such as , do you offer domestic-partner benefits?And , do you have a sexual harassment policy that protects gay and lesbianworkers?Loewenthal , president of the <ORGANIZATION>University of Maryland 's Pride Alliance</ORGANIZATION> , is one ofa growing number of young lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people who aremore comfortable coming out in the workplace . 
Along with the usual concernsabout pay and job duties , they also want employers to be clear about theirattitudes toward gender and sexuality issues.Daryl <PERSON>Herrschaft</PERSON> , deputy director of the WorkNet project at the gay rightsadvocacy group Human Rights Campaign , said more people are coming out to theirfamilies and friends at an earlier age , often encouraged by the positive imagesthey see in the media . 
" Naturally , this is going to spill over into theworkplace , " he said.The transition is not conflict-free . 
No federal law prohibits discriminationagainst workers for their sexual orientation or gender identity . 
Only 14 statesand the District have such a law that extends to both public and privateemployers . 
Courts and state legislatures have become battlegrounds fordisagreements between employers and employees on such laws and how they willwork.Meanwhile , as the regulations are sorted out , things can be a bit confusing forworkers , who might find it best to assess employers individually.Herrschaft said several clues can help a worker evaluate a prospective employer.First , look for a mention of sexual orientation in the organization 's policy onequal employment opportunity . 
While companies do not always live up to thesepronouncements , the statement does set a tone for how the company viewsdiversity issues , he said . 
It also suggests that internal recourse would beavailable for workers who felt they were treated unfairly.Another tip-off , <PERSON>Herrschaft</PERSON> said , is whether a company offers domestic-partnerbenefits . 
<ORGANIZATION>HRC</ORGANIZATION> tracks whether large companies offer such benefits , among otherindicators , in its annual " State of the Workplace " report . 
As of <DATE>Dec. 31</DATE> , HRChad counted 7,149 private employers and colleges and universities that provideddomestic-partner benefits . 
It also found that <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> of the companies in theFortune 500 did so.For workers who are uncomfortable asking direct questions about policies , <PERSON>Herrschaft</PERSON> recommends an indirect approach , which can be tailored to thespecific job.For example , he said , if the position is in marketing , ask whether the companyhas considered niche campaigns aimed at minority groups , including gays andlesbians . 
The interviewer 's reaction to the suggestion can give a strong hintabout workplace culture.Not sure which approach to take ? 
Students and recent graduates can look to theiruniversity 's career center for guidance . 
For example , the <ORGANIZATION>University ofMaryland</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Career Center</ORGANIZATION> includes a special section devoted to issues affectinglesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender students.If students have concerns not addressed in the myriad pamphlets and handouts thecenter has on hand , they can turn to <PERSON>Emily Morris</PERSON> , a program director at thecenter who also serves as the liaison to the university 's <ORGANIZATION>Office of LGBT Equity.Morris</ORGANIZATION> said her role as liaison is primarily outreach and general communityeducation , but she is available to answer students ' questions -- and they oftenhave plenty , as graduation approaches . 
" In general , college students whoidentify as LGBT may find support or an inclusive community on campus but are n'tsure what they 'll find in the workplace , " she said.Loewenthal , a junior computer science and business major , does not expectproblems to come up often . 
He has done his homework , and he said he found thatmost big employers are progressive on these issues.He even keeps rejection in perspective : " If they see my sexuality as a negative , I would n't want to work there anyway .
