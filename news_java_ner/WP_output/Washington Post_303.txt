One of the most indelible moments in " The Hurt Locker " was a scene in which abomb technician played by <PERSON>Jeremy Renner</PERSON> returned from <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> to his American hometown , where he visited a supermarket cereal aisle . 
Paralyzed by the sheervastness of it , he stood there staring , utterly dislocated and alienated fromthe culture he 'd so recently risked his life defending.Writer-director <PERSON>Claudia Myers</PERSON> has made an entire movie of that moment with " FortBliss , " an absorbing , uncannily on-point portrait of an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> medic navigatingthe transition from her high-stakes job - including two tours in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> - to a complicated domestic life.Gracefully portrayed by <PERSON>Michelle Monaghan</PERSON> in an impressive breakout performance , <PERSON>Maggie Swann</PERSON> is tough , smart and coolly competent , even when removing a piece oflive ammunition from a soldier 's abdomen . 
But when she returns to <LOCATION>Fort Bliss</LOCATION> - the El Paso military base that plays itself here - she does n't get the hero ' swelcome of her peers . 
Instead , her resentful ex-husband , played by <ORGANIZATION>RonLivingston</ORGANIZATION> , delivers an awkward hug hello before taking her to reunite withtheir 5-year-old son , <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> , who sees <PERSON>Maggie</PERSON> as little more than a stranger.Myers has discovered a phenomenally gifted young actor named <PERSON>Oakes Fegley</PERSON> toplay <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> , who breaks into an enraged tantrum when <PERSON>Maggie</PERSON> takes him to live withher . 
But even though the beleaguered <PERSON>Maggie</PERSON> is a sympathetic figure , she 's farfrom perfect : She clumsily mishandles her reunification with the little boy , using her most intimidating command presence to bully him into compliance.Myers , a Washington-based filmmaker who has worked extensively with the militarymaking documentaries and interactive videos , has clearly done her homework , seeding " Fort Bliss " with vivid details of life on the base , from bleary-eyedarrivals at a day care facility while it 's still nighttime to <PERSON>Maggie</PERSON> 's inabilityto sleep in a normal bed . 
Her most observant flourishes are to be found in thebrief exchanges that illuminate the difficulties of service members returning to " a life that does n't want you in it . 
" In many ways , " Fort Bliss " plays like a dramatized version of " Soldier Girls , " <PERSON>Helen Thorpe</PERSON> 's similarly sensitive chronicle of female <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> membersand their wartime experiences . 
Like that book , " Fort Bliss " delves into theprofessionalism , pride and inescapable tensions that animate women 's lives inthe military , including sexual harassment , here depicted with exceptionalnuance.At its core , though , " Fort Bliss " is less a war picture than a compassionate , deeply engaging portrayal of one woman 's struggle with the age-old conundrum ofbalancing work and family . 
As much drama as there is to be found in <LOCATION>Maggie</LOCATION> ' sflashbacks to wartime duty , as well as her incipient romance with a dreamymechanic ( <PERSON>Manolo Cardona</PERSON> ) and the specter of future redeployment , the mostgalvanizing moments center on the incremental steps she and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> take towardmutual trust.It 's not nation-building , but the stakes are just as high . 
In <ORGANIZATION>Myers</ORGANIZATION> 's capablehands , and with a powerful , vanity-free performance by <PERSON>Monaghan</PERSON> , " Fort Bliss " joins " Coming Home " and " The Best Years of Our Lives " as a movie deeply in sync , not just with the military characters it depicts , but also with the civilianworld that awaits them with such confoundingly mixed messages.ann.hornaday@washpost.comÂ½Unrated .
