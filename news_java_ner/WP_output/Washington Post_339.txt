" Clash , a <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> area native , had been on leave from the lauded <ORGANIZATION>PBS</ORGANIZATION> children ' sshow since news broke this month about the first accuser.NBC 's mighty returnNBC - once home to " St. Elsewhere " and " ER , " " Seinfeld " and " Cheers , " <PERSON>Johnny Carson</PERSON> and " ALF " - has finally clawed its way back to the landof the prime-time living after being buried for years in theprogram-to-the-margins underworld of former chief <PERSON>Jeff Zucker.NBC</PERSON> will win its first <DATE>November</DATE> " sweep " in nine years among 18-to-49-year-oldviewers , who are the currency of the TV business - jumping from a fourth-placefinish last November.The network decided to celebrate by putting <ORGANIZATION>NBC Entertainment Chairman BobGreenblatt</ORGANIZATION> on the phone with reporters <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> as another full week 's ratingswere issued , officially sealing the deal . 
" We 're very happy this <DATE>November</DATE> - the first time we 've been this happy in a longtime , " <PERSON>Greenblatt</PERSON> began , well , happily.Then some <PERSON>Debbie Downer</PERSON> on the call kicked off the Q&A period by askingGreenblatt whether he thought <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> would remain in first place in the <DATE>firstquarter of ' 13</DATE> , when " The Voice " and " Revolution " are on hiatus ( and <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> has theSuper Bowl and <ORGANIZATION>Fox</ORGANIZATION> has <PERSON>Nicki Minaj</PERSON> wreaking havoc on " American Idol " ) . 
" We expect a pretty significant leveling of the playing field , but we knew thatgoing in , " <PERSON>Greenblatt</PERSON> acknowledged . 
But , he said , " we just feel like , to startout this strong heading into what we know will be a tough winter , feels like abig accomplishment . 
" Plus , <PERSON>Greenblatt</PERSON> forecast that in <DATE>March</DATE> , when " The Voice " and " Revolution " return , <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> will be back in the game in a big way.Then along comes Negative <PERSON>Nell</PERSON> , wondering what <PERSON>Greenblatt</PERSON> thought the odds wereof <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> 's finishing the whole TV season ( mid-September to late May ) ranked No. 1 . 
But <PERSON>Greenblatt</PERSON> 's happiness was too strong for them : " I feel pretty confident we will not end up in fourth place again this year , " hebegan . 
" I 'd be astonished if we ended up being No. 1 , given the firepower some of theother networks have , but thrilled if we landed at 2 and really pleased if justin third place . . . . Third place would be a triumph for us . 
" The reporter noted , as if meaning it to sting , that <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> had finished last seasonin third place.Greenblatt countered pleasantly that last year , <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> had the Super Bowl.That shut 'em up . 
' Boss ' is cannedPay-cable network <ORGANIZATION>Starz</ORGANIZATION> has canceled <PERSON>Kelsey Grammer</PERSON> 's " Boss " because the show ' ssecond season clocked fewer viewers than its first.The second season , which wrapped its 18 episodes in <DATE>mid-October</DATE> , averaged about940 ,000 viewers across multiple plays . 
That 's not far behind the ratings forStarz 's " Magic City . 
" On the other hand , <ORGANIZATION>Starz</ORGANIZATION> had domestic rights on " Boss , " while it owns " MagicCity " outright and therefore reaps the benefit of its latter show 's saleinternationally . 
You do the math . 
" Boss " opened with a bang . 
<ORGANIZATION>Starz</ORGANIZATION> CEO <PERSON>Chris Albrecht</PERSON> ordered a second seasonbefore the first even premiered in <DATE>October 2011</DATE> . 
But the ratings were n't stellar , and , during a Q&A at <ORGANIZATION>Summer TV Press Tour</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>2012in August</DATE> , show creator <PERSON>Farhad Safinia</PERSON> said he was " heartbroken " with the firstseason 's numbers - while Grammer played the king and took a phone call onstagefrom his wife , irking a hotel ballroom 's worth of TV critics who might havehelped goose the second season 's ratings . 
Too late now.Grammer , who believes he did not get an Emmy nomination for his first season on " Boss " because he 's a Republican , played a <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> mayor suffering secretly froma neurological disorder.demoraesl@washpost.comTo read previous columns by <PERSON>Lisa de Moraes</PERSON> , go to washingtonpost.com/tvblog .
