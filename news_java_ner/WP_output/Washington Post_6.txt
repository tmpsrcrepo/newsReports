" Whatever you hear reported ? 
It happens a lot more than anything you ' rehearing , " a soldier waiting in line for her salad told me . 
" It 's all hush-hush . 
Still . 
" We were talking about more than the wilted romaine and heavy-handed dressing atthis <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon City</ORGANIZATION> salad place . 
This was about sexual assault.The 29-year-old woman , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she 's notauthorized to talk to reporters , said she 's been around scores of sexualassaults during her 10 years in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> . 
A soldier under her command was rapeda few years ago , and she had to fight for the case to be taken seriously by hersuperiors.Sen . 
<PERSON>Kirsten Gillibrand</PERSON> ( D-N.Y. ) is pushing a bill to move military sexualassault cases outside the chain of command . 
She 's got 26,000 reasons - that ' sthe <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> 's estimate of the number of men and women in uniform who werevictims of some kind of sexual assault last year . 
But only 3,553 members of themilitary filed sexual assault complaints from <DATE>October 2012</DATE> to June.The reason for the huge gap , <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> says , is that the alleged victims do n'ttrust the chain of command.But my salad bar friend said she 's not so sure that cutting the brass out of theprocess is the answer to the problem . 
" A commanding officer may know things about the case that others do n't know , " she said . 
And in the alleged rape , she was an advocate for the victim as acommanding officer . 
" Whatever they decide , they have to change something , " she said.Thousands of women are serving in uniform in our region . 
I wanted to talk tothem about this issue , instead of interviewing advocates or politicians orvictims and their lawyers . 
At gas stations , grocery stores and salad bars fromFort Belvoir to <ORGANIZATION>Joint Base Andrews</ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> , I found that active-dutywomen had mixed feelings about how best to deal with sexual assault . 
" I would n't want my chain of command to have anything to do with it , " said a28-year-old soldier , who said she has not been assaulted but could n't imaginethat a commanding officer should have anything to do with investigating andprosecuting an assault.Another woman , 22 , said she would have no problem with punishment being donethrough the chain of command because that 's simply part of military culture.Although they differed on how sexual assault should be prosecuted and punished , all of the women agreed on one thing : It 's a huge problem.So let 's take a look at what happened when a case was taken away from themilitary - <DATE>last week</DATE> 's trial of Lt. Col. <PERSON>Jeffrey</PERSON> Krusinski.The <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> asked <LOCATION>Arlington County</LOCATION> prosecutors to hand <PERSON>Krusinski</PERSON> , who was thenhead of the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> office on sexual assault prevention , back to it after hewas charged with a sexual assault count at a drunken <ORGANIZATION>Cinco de Mayo</ORGANIZATION> bar party inCrystal <LOCATION>City</LOCATION> . 
The prosecutors refused.The charge was later bumped down to an assault . 
And after a brief trial lastweek , a civilian jury acquitted him of that charge.Did the system work ? 
Some folks argued that his military commanders would havepunished him more severely than the jury did . 
But I liked the fact that he wassubjected to a civilian judicial process.His alleged victim said <PERSON>Krusinski</PERSON> came up behind her outside <ORGANIZATION>Freddie</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>Beach Barthat</LOCATION> <TIME>night</TIME> , squeezed her behind , asked her how she liked it , then swaggered - ormaybe staggered , since the police report said he 'd been drinking heavily - off.Witnesses said he was doing that all over the bar that night and had a couple ofother targets , including a bartender . 
They all brushed him off . 
Not the23-year-old graduate student . 
She confronted him and began hitting him in theface . 
She testified that she used her right hand . 
Other witnesses said the womanwas bashing him with the cellphone she was holding her in her left hand.Any woman who has ever been groped or violated understands the woman 's primalresponse . 
The <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> jury ultimately decided that conflicting accounts aboutthe details of the assault and the woman 's description of the beating wereenough to drop the case.But in the meantime , <PERSON>Krusinski</PERSON> was yanked from his sexual-harassment-preventionpost , and the rest of the country got a good look at how ridiculous it was tohave a man like this in charge of such an important program.And that 's where we see the real problem . 
With guys such as <PERSON>Krusinski</PERSON> - innocentof assault , but guilty of living up to boorish stereotypes - the military was n'treally taking this whole epidemic seriously.What it has been doing simply is n't working . 
So , short of hiring a special forceof mobile-phone wielding avengers , trying anything new will be an improvement.Let 's hope a few more senators feel that way , too.dvorakp@washpost.comOn Twitter : @petuladTo read previous columns , go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak .
