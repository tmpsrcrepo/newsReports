<PERSON>Tavon White</PERSON> 's loyal women brought him anything he wanted - drugs , money , thelatest cellphones , tobacco and food , federal prosecutors say . 
They even boughthim luxury German cars.In the past four years , four of these women allegedly gave him five children.One tattooed " Tavon " on her neck ; another has " Tavon " on her wrist.White was an inmate in the <ORGANIZATION>Baltimore City Detention Center</ORGANIZATION> . 
The harem ? 
His jailguards , according to an indictment.Thirteen female corrections officers essentially handed control of the jail overto White and other members of the <ORGANIZATION>Black Guerilla Family</ORGANIZATION> , prosecutors say , allowing gang members to sell drugs and other contraband from behind bars . 
Thejaw-dropping allegations left plenty of people wondering : Do women have anybusiness being guards in a men 's jail?Here 's something you might not know . 
In <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> 's jails , which are run by thestate , more than <PERCENT>60 percent</PERCENT> of the guards are women , <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> correctionsofficials estimate . 
And nationwide , their numbers are rapidly approaching paritywith male guards . 
Women made up about <PERCENT>37 percent</PERCENT> of the corrections force in2007 , according to the <ORGANIZATION>American Correctional Association.It</ORGANIZATION> makes sense . 
Our incarceration rate has skyrocketed over the past 25 years , and most of those caught up in the criminal justice system are men . 
Fewer menthan ever can pass the background check to become corrections officers . 
Womenhave filled the gap , applying in droves for stressful but stable jobs that payan average of <MONEY>$ 40,000</MONEY> a year , according to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Bureau of Labor</ORGANIZATION> Statistics.Now get ready for my next bombshell . 
According to a frequently quoted report bythe <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> on sex in prisons and jails , most of the guards havingsex with their charges are women . 
" Among the 39,121 male prison inmates who hadbeen victims of staff sexual misconduct , <PERCENT>69 %</PERCENT> reported sexual activity withfemale staff , " according to the <ORGANIZATION>2008-09 Bureau of Justice Statistics study.It</ORGANIZATION> 's even higher in juvenile detention facilities , where <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> of the boyswho said they were victims of sexual advances by officers said they wereapproached - and frequently raped - by women.Sometimes we can make our pedestals a little too high . 
When women assumepositions of power over the lives of others , they can become predators just likemen can . 
" There 's an assumption that women wo n't do this , ca n't do this , that it 's not inour nature , " said <PERSON>Brenda Smith</PERSON> , a law professor at <ORGANIZATION>American University</ORGANIZATION> who haswritten extensively about sexual assault in jails and prisons . 
" But it is in ournature . 
" What about the female guards who are targeted by cunning and charismaticinmates ? 
The women who are loveless , lonely and easily seduced ? 
Are theypredators or the prey?In <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> , jailhouse lothario <PERSON>Michael Murphy</PERSON> seduced at least five femaleprison guards a few years ago . 
He was known for staging pornlike scenarios.In <DATE>February</DATE> , two female corrections officers in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> were arrested aftergetting pregnant by inmates . 
One of them , <PERSON>Nancy Gonzalez</PERSON> , was having sex with <PERSON>Ronell Wilson</PERSON> , who is on death row for killing two policeofficers . 
" I took a chance because I was so vulnerable and wanted to be loved , and now Iam carrying his child , " <PERSON>Gonzalez</PERSON> was recorded saying.Lt . 
Col. <PERSON>Kim Spadaro</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>American Jail Association</ORGANIZATION> , has seen hershare of corrupted correctional officers , both male and female . 
" In general , when the men do these things , the men do it to make the money , " said <PERSON>Spadaro</PERSON> , who is the head of the <LOCATION>Broward County</LOCATION> ( <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION> ) Department ofDetention , where about <PERCENT>34 percent</PERCENT> of the officers are female . 
" The women do itbecause they 've fallen in love . 
" There was surely some of that in this <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> case . 
According to theindictment , investigators found an operating manual of sorts used by <ORGANIZATION>BGF</ORGANIZATION> thatdetailed " how new BGF recruits are taught to target a specific stereotype of aCO [ correctional officer ] , specifically women with low self-esteem , insecuritiesand certain physical attributes . 
" Once seduced , the women saw themselves as the wives and girlfriends of White andhis associates.In a jail like <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> 's , where local convicts are guarded by local officers , there 's a toxic social dynamic , <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> reminded me . 
On the outside , in thesecommunities where women far outnumber men , the men have all the cards , she said.But when the men are locked up and women have the keys , the scenario is flipped.Seduction may be about power , <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> said . 
A woman can have any man she wants.And he 's usually begging for her attention.Remember <PERSON>Abu Ghraib</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> Pfc. <PERSON>Lynndie R. England</PERSON> , who was a21-year-old reservist when pictures surfaced of her holding a leash tied to theneck of a naked Iraqi prisoner?What was missing there is the same thing that has been missing at the <ORGANIZATION>BaltimoreCity Detention Center</ORGANIZATION> : oversight.Female guards are n't really the problem ; incompetent bosses are . 
If womenwere n't there , White and BGF might have been trying to figure out a way to usemoney and power to corrupt male guards.As long as there has been work , there have been men who have screwed it up.Dirty cops , corrupt bankers , shady businessmen , filthy politicians , molestingdentists . 
At no point do we say , " Men do n't belong in this field . 
" Quite simply , corrupt people do n't belong in this field . 
And these female guardsneed to get booted as far and as hard as any man would.dvorakp@washpost.comTwitter: @petuladTo read previous columns , go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak .
