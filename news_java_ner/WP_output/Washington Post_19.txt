Yes , all women have been harassed.Yes , all women have been judged by our looks , not our merit.Yes , all women have been around men who have discounted , denied and demeaned us.Yes , all women are outraged by the misogynistic ravings of <PERSON>Elliot Rodger</PERSON> , thenarcissistic 22-year-old who went on a killing spree in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> , on <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> because women did n't respond to him the way he believed he wasentitled to have them respond.Rodger vowed to slaughter the magazine-beautiful blondes who did n't want to havesex with him . 
He posted rants in online forums where - surprise , surprise - thatkind of misogynistic bile was unremarkable and other men ratified his hatred.Women heard <PERSON>Elliot Rodger</PERSON> . 
And they began flooding Twitter by the hundreds ofthousands with their responses , using the hashtag #YesAllWomen . 
" I 've spent 19 yrs teaching my daughter how not to be raped , " one mothertweeted . 
" How long have you spent teaching your son not to rape ? 
#YesAllWomen " " Because I was n't ' asking for it ' when he hit me , " another tweeted , " and Ishould n't have to defend myself a decade later . 
#YesAllWomen " " #YesAllWomen b/c we are called fat , ugly , and slutty/threatened w/rape all thetime online , & we are told to ' just ignore the trolls . ' 
" The #YesAllWomen Twitter campaign is powerful . 
And necessary . 
It tells thestories we keep to ourselves , and it takes back a Twitterverse that is so oftenused as a space to intimidate , harass and threaten women.It 's true that #NotAllMen are like <PERSON>Elliot Rodger</PERSON> . 
But there are millions whoshare the same twisted view of women that he did , and we encounter them everyday on our streets and campuses and military bases , in our offices andboardrooms and gyms and bars . 
Sometimes we encounter them in our own families.Elliot <PERSON>Rodger</PERSON> has exposed the sick world of the Men 's Rights Activist movement,self-described " alphas " who fume about any and all the times they do n't call theshots with women , specifically the airbrushed , inflated and photo-shoppedcreatures they assume are there for them.Mostly , it 's about sex . 
Or the lack thereof.A group of them call themselves Pickup Artists . 
And some sell their wisdom - tips that include stale bar tricks , ways to insult and ignore women as part oftheir seduction - as online courses , apps or seminars . 
They call this ability toget women to sleep with them " Game . 
" When desperate men who shell out cash thinking it will buy them Game fail , theylash out online . 
Not at the men who try to sell them Game , but at the women whodid n't buy the act.Rodger , the son of a film director who drove a <ORGANIZATION>BMW</ORGANIZATION> and never had to work asummer job , was one of the Pickup Artist haters . 
On Web sites for like-mindedmen , he posted racist and misogynistic rants so bad , they were flagged by theSouthern Poverty Law Center . 
And in his manifesto , he said the killings would n'thave happened if just one beautiful woman had paid attention to him.He may have been mentally ill , but he was also the product of a culture thatobjectifies , demeans and sexualizes women . 
Nearly one in five American womenreport being raped at some time , according to the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Controland Prevention</ORGANIZATION> . 
The raging sexual assault epidemic in our military and on ourcollege campuses is a reflection of the entitlement too many men feel they haveto women 's bodies.Every day we hear of another military man - powerful , disciplined , bulging withGame - who sexually assaulted a woman in uniform . 
This month , investigationsbegan at 55 colleges and universities over the way their officials have handledsexual assault . 
These are our nation 's thought leaders - privileged , educated , bursting with tweedy Game - who have rebranded rape as " non-consensual sex " sothey wo n't have to deal with the misogyny on display on their campuses.Think it 's not real ? 
Consider the texts and e-mails allegedly exchanged betweenmembers of a banished frat at <ORGANIZATION>American University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The young men - who also wereidentified as scholars , interns at prestigious nonprofits and senators ' offices - show a shuddering hatred and objectification of their female classmates.In the five years I 've been a columnist , I 've been called a whore , a slut andworse when I 've written about work-life balance , breast-feeding or child care.I 've been told that I need to have poison poured into my " whiney-woman mouth . 
" The unfiltered misogyny of <PERSON>Elliot Rodger</PERSON> is extreme , but it 's an indicator ofthe hatred that remains a stubborn part of our society 's fabric . 
No , #NotAllMenare like <PERSON>Elliot Rodger</PERSON> . 
But #YesAllWomen reveal the little pieces of him weencounter every single day.petula.dvorak@washpost.comTwitter:@petulad√Ø ... OE To read previous columns , go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak .
