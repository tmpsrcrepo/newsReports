Among the most shocking revelations in the 162-page Freeh reportis that thereis n't a shocking revelation to be found . 
By now even the most skeptical had torealize that <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky</PERSON> had done the horrible deeds he was found guilty ofdoing , that the late <PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> had known about them and that university andcommunity officials had looked the other way.If you were a doubter till the bitter end , this is that bitter end . 
Read thereport compiled by former <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>Louis Freeh</PERSON> and his law firm . 
If you canmake it to the final page and still not see the culpability of the majorcharacters in this dreadful drama , then you 're willfully blind.The only line in the entire document that brought so much as a glimmer of asmile was this one , which cited one of the causes for the scandal as " a cultureof reverence for the football program that is ingrained at all levels of thecampus . 
" A culture of reverence . 
That 's what existed in <LOCATION>Happy Valley</LOCATION> , all right , and notonly there . 
Behind every great football program there is a culture of reverence , and behind many not-so-great ones , too . 
( At some schools , of course , you need tosubstitute " basketball " for " football , " but it 's the same difference . ) 
And withthis culture comes corruption . 
You think a culture of reverence did n'tcontribute to the recent contretemps at <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Southern Cal</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> , justto name a few?College football is in crisis , at least among thinking fans who have observedthe corners cut , the cheating , the players not graduated , the unfairness of thepostseason , and have questioned their loyalty to a sport with so many problemsand so few solutions in sight . 
And then came <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> , and the revelations ofwhat happened at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> . 
And <DATE>Saturday</DATE> afternoons for some went fromuncomfortable to untenable.Yet the combination of pedophilia and big-time athletics should surprise no onewith an understanding of the sickness ( and if you do n't know the warning signs , educate yourself , right now ) . 
Pedophiles need bait , and tickets and autographs , and backstage access to some of the best athletes are tremendous lures . 
One ofthe saddest aspects of the <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> scandal is the length to which theuniversity was willing to go to ignore the rape of children not only by anemployee of the school , but on school property , and on school-funded trips.Astounding.And it 's one reason the Freeh report should n't be the last word on the topic.After <PERSON>Mike McQueary</PERSON> witnessed the assault in the showers in <DATE>February 2001</DATE> , officials - who knew about the <DATE>1998</DATE> allegations that were investigated , do n'tforget - seem at first prepared to act but suddenly backed off . 
They agreedinstead to have a stern talking-to with <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> . 
Athletic Director TimothyCurley suggests telling <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> that they are " uncomfortable " with thisinformation , that they will inform Second Mile , the charity that <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> hadfounded , and that <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> was n't allowed in athletic facilities with children.In other words , do n't do this on our property again . 
University President <PERSON>GrahamSpanier</PERSON> 's response ? 
" The approach you outline is humane and a reasonable way toproceed . 
" Well , no , it was neither humane nor reasonable . 
It was unbelievably cruel , andincredibly stupid . 
Oh , it was kindness itself to <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> . 
But never in thesee-mail exchanges do you get the feeling these men realize they are talking aboutchildren who have been sexually assaulted , and that their gyms , showers , football games , road trips and possibly even themselves have been used as luresby a child rapist.The culture of reverence appears throughout the report . 
In <DATE>1998</DATE> , when detectivesinterviewed <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> about some of his now infamous showers , they did so in theLasch building , where the incidents occurred , so as not to the put the formerdefensive coordinator , ironically enough , on the defensive . 
In other words , theygave the pedophile the home-field advantage . 
Interrogating him in a policestation might have at least scared the man into getting help or admitting he hada problem.It was clear from his comment to the mother of one of his victims - " I wish Iwere dead " - that <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> knew what he was doing was wrong and that he could n'tor would n't stop just because some university officials told him to . 
That remarkwas as much of a warning as any of the accusations his victims made . 
Penn Statewas n't listening to any of them.So what now ? 
Many of the recommendations in the report are bureaucratic : Theathletic department should no longer have free rein at the university.University officials should provide answers when theBoard of Trusteeshasquestions . 
And everyone needs some human resources training , stat.Is that enough ? 
It 's hard to feel vindictive when the principal players haveleft the stage : <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> is in prison ; <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> has passed away . 
Other officialsare gone , fired or resigned.And yet , and yet . . . is the culture of reverence still there ? 
On Saturdayafternoons , is it going to be easy to forget those poor shivering boys as fansstroll campus in the beautiful autumn sunshine ? 
If <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> comes awayunscathed - no scholarships lost , no outside controls put in place - does thatsend the message that even child rape is less important than a bowl appearanceand a Big Ten title?The <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> death penalty feels good and right today , when we 're outraged anew atthe gross injustices perpetrated at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> . 
It 's probably not going tohappen , not the least because the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> no longer has the clout to pull it off.Conferences rule the world , and TV contracts rule the conferences . 
It 's probablytoo much to hope that the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> can quit wringing its hands long enough to doanything.That leaves <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> . 
The school has done its share of hand-wringing , insisting that this is an aberration . 
So appoint an independent body toadminister some rough justice , and then take the punishment . 
As we 've seen , astern talking-to - even one that lasts 162 pages - just is n't going to cut it.hamiltont@washpost.comFor previous columns by <PERSON>Tracee Hamilton</PERSON> , visit washingtonpost.com/hamilton.More from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post Sports : <PERSON>Jenkins</PERSON> : The truth is , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> liedresourceFreeh : ' Total disregard ' for victimsComplete report on <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> investigationRobinson : <PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> 's shameresourcePoll : Should <ORGANIZATION>PSU</ORGANIZATION> football program get the death penalty?On Leadership : Failings of board of trusteesPhotos : Report says <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> failed to protect kids
