<DATE>October</DATE> Surprises just are n't what they used to be.Carnival barker and Mitt Romney surrogate <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> ( R-Absurdity ) set thegossip mill churning this week when he declared he would make a " majorannouncement " about President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> . 
" It 's very big - bigger than anybody wouldknow , " he told <ORGANIZATION>Fox News</ORGANIZATION> Channel.Would it be the bombshell revelation that <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> sold cocaine in college ? 
Thediscovery of divorce papers for the president and the first lady?A betting house set 250/1 odds that <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> would prove that <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> is from anotherplanet , and 500/1 odds that he would announce that he is <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's father . 
Thedisclosure that <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> is not American was a relatively safe bet , at 2/5 odds.But Trump surprised them all by announcing . . . absolutely nothing . 
Instead , hereleased at high noon on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> what had the look of a ransom video , in whichthe <PERSON>Donald</PERSON> himself , appearing puffy and unwell , played a character that was partDr . 
Evil , part Crazy <PERSON>Eddie</PERSON> . 
" I have a deal for the president , a deal that I do n't believe he can refuse , " Trump announced , leaning forward and chopping the air with his hands . 
" If BarackObama opens up and gives his college records and applications and if he giveshis passport applications and records , I will give to a charity of his choice . 
. 
. 
a check , immediately , for <MONEY>$ 5 million</MONEY> ! 
The check will be given within onehour after he releases all of the records so stated . 
" And if you act now , Mr. <PERSON>President</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> will include an extra added freecomplimentary bonus gift at no cost to you!In a singsong voice , <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> teased the president with possible charities thatmight interest him - " inner-city children in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> , American Cancer Society " - and repeated his terms : " All he has to do to get fivemillion dollars . . . " This was trumped up even by the <PERSON>Donald</PERSON> 's self-aggrandizing standards.Denunciations and derision rang out from the political left , right and center.The bookmaker that took bets on <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> 's bombshell refunded the wagers . 
The realestate mogul had managed to make his real announcement resemble the Onion ' sspoof article : " <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> announced that he is a very sad man who has nothingto live for other than drawing attention to himself . 
" One beneficiary of <ORGANIZATION>Trump</ORGANIZATION> 's bust was the publicity-seeking lawyer <PERSON>Gloria Allred</PERSON> , if only because it made her own <DATE>October</DATE> Surprise seem somewhat more newsworthyby comparison . 
She went to court <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> with the ex-wife of one of Romney ' sformer business associates as part of an effort to unseal testimony Romney gavein a 20-year-old divorce case.Allred 's client is alleging , according to the celebrity gossip Web site TMZ , that <PERSON>Romney</PERSON> lied when he testified during her divorce from <ORGANIZATION>Staples</ORGANIZATION> founder TomStemberg . 
Romney , whose <ORGANIZATION>Bain Capital</ORGANIZATION> backed Staples , allegedly testified thatthe office supply chain was worth little , so the ex-wife lost out . 
( AMassachusetts judge is expected to hold another hearing on the matter <DATE>Thursday</DATE> . ) 
Even if true , the <PERSON>Allred</PERSON> surprise seems little more likely to shake up thepresidential race than <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> 's histrionics.The only true <DATE>October</DATE> Surprises this year have been executed by candidatesthemselves - and they are n't what you 'd call happy surprises . 
The latest belongsto <PERSON>Richard Mourdock</PERSON> , a Republican candidate for <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> , who <DATE>onTuesday</DATE> said abortion should be forbidden in all cases because " I think evenwhen life begins in that horrible situation of rape , that it is something thatGod intended to happen . 
" Romney 's campaign distanced itself from <ORGANIZATION>Mourdock</ORGANIZATION> 's sentiment , and Sen. <PERSON>KellyAyotte</PERSON> ( R-N.H . ) 
canceled an appearance with him . 
Mourdock , a tea party candidatewho already was in jeopardy of losing what had been a safely Republican seat , attempted to clarify his views <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> , saying he opposes " any kind of sexualviolence . 
" Mourdock 's remarks put him in the undesirable category of <PERSON>Todd Akin</PERSON> , theRepublican <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> nominee in <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> who squandered an easy win in <DATE>August</DATE> whenhe asserted that " legitimate rape " rarely causes pregnancy . 
But Akin had alreadyunveiled an <DATE>October</DATE> Surprise of his own : comparing his opponent , Democratic Sen.Claire <PERSON>McCaskill</PERSON> , to a canine . 
" It 's a little bit like one of those dogs , you know ' fetch , ' and she goes toWashington , <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> , and gets all of these taxes and red tape and bureaucracy , " Akin said on Saturday.Akin 's campaign spokesman , <PERSON>Rick Tyler</PERSON> , later tweeted that <PERSON>McCaskill</PERSON> 's breedwould be a bull <PERSON>Shih Tzu</PERSON> - but he spelled it differently.Surprising , but wrong . 
We already have had a dog of that variety this campaignseason , and his name is <PERSON>Donald Trump.danamilbank@washpost.comFor</PERSON> more <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Sketch columns , visit washingtonpost.com/milbank .
