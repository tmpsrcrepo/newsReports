Rep. <PERSON>Todd Akin</PERSON> 's controversial comments on abortion and rape - and the MissouriRepublican 's vow <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to continue his <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> campaign - have givenDemocrats an opening on an issue on which they enjoy strong public support.In the past two days , party leaders in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and their supporters acrossthe country have highlighted Akin 's comments to try to raise money , as part ofcampaign pitches and to revive the " war on women " theme that emerged this yearafter some Republicans came out against health-care coverage for contraception . 
" If this is n't a war on women , I do n't know what is , " Sen. <PERSON>Barbara Mikulski</PERSON> ( Md. ) , the dean of Democratic women in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> , said <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in response toAkin 's comments.In a televised interview that aired <DATE>Sunday</DATE> , <PERSON>Akin</PERSON> said that women had the powerto prevent pregnancies that result from " legitimate rape . " 
In rare cases whenpregnancies occurred , he said , abortions still should not be allowed.Three-quarters of Americans support allowing abortion in cases of rape , according to Gallup polls . 
Among Republicans , there is broad opposition toabortion but disagreement over whether the practice ought to be allowed in someextreme cases.Many party leaders agree with permitting exceptions for rape and incest , including presidential candidate <PERSON>Mitt Romney</PERSON> , who on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> called on Akin todrop his <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> bid.But antiabortion activists and some conservatives - including Rep. <PERSON>Paul Ryan</PERSON> ( Wis. ) , Romney 's running mate - consider that viewpoint inconsistent with theirbelief that abortion is murder.Sensing their vulnerability on the issue , Republicans continued <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to tryto push Akin out of a <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> race that they have been counting on to help returnthem to the majority.Senate Minority Leader <PERSON>Mitch McConnell</PERSON> ( R-Ky . ) 
again called on Akin to drop outof the race , saying that he " made a deeply offensive error at a time when hiscandidacy carries great consequence for the future of our country . " 
Romney saidAkin 's comments were " offensive and wrong . 
" Democrats moved <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> to tie congressional candidates across the country toAkin . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee</ORGANIZATION> noted that Akin was " farfrom alone " in his push to " redefine rape and limit victims ' access to healthcare . 
" In a message targeting Rep. <PERSON>Mike Coffman</PERSON> ( R-Colo . ) 
, for instance , the <ORGANIZATION>DCCC</ORGANIZATION> saidhe " abused his power in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> " by supporting Akin 's calls for restrictionson abortion.In a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> race in <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> , Democrat <PERSON>Steven Horsford</PERSON> put out a statementdeclaring that during a failed 2010 Senate bid , his <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> opponent , DannyTarkanian , " tried to out-Tea Party his opponents by opposing abortion even inthe cases of rape and incest . 
" Sen. <PERSON>Kirsten Gillibrand</PERSON> ( D-N.Y. ) , who is pushing to have more women elected tothe <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> , asked her network of supporters to donate to Akin 's opponent , Sen.Claire <PERSON>McCaskill</PERSON> ( D-Mo . ) 
. 
" We 've come to see how some right-wing Republicans will invent all sorts ofunfounded , far-fetched theories to support their ultraconservative ideologicalbeliefs , " <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> said in an e-mail to donors.On the presidential campaign trail , about two dozen protesters with <ORGANIZATION>MoveOn.org</ORGANIZATION> , a liberal group , picketed <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Carnegie</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION> , near a campaign rally heldby Ryan . 
The group carried signs reading " Ryan and Akin Agree : Only Some RapesCount , " referencing bills sponsored by Akin and <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON> that would ban abortion inall cases and narrow the definition of rape.Elizabeth Schipp , political director of <ORGANIZATION>NARAL Pro-Choice America</ORGANIZATION> , an abortionrights group , said that Akin 's comments would serve as " just one more tool inour arsenal to use against these anti-choice politicians . 
" Before <DATE>Sunday</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>NARAL</ORGANIZATION> had launched an " Obama Defector Program , " designed to woowomen skeptical about <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's reelection back into the fold by highlighting GOPpositions . 
Now , <PERSON>Schipp</PERSON> said , the project plans to call attention to severalvulnerable Republican congressional candidates , including <PERSON>Coffman</PERSON> , Rep. TimWalberg ( R-Mich . ) 
and Rep. <PERSON>Frank Guinta</PERSON> ( R-N.H . ) 
. 
" Just when the Republicans are thinking and hoping that they 've got this lickedand they can move on to other issues , somebody like <PERSON>Todd Akin</PERSON> gets up and sayssomething like that , and here we go again , " Schipp said.Some conservatives rallied around Akin . 
<ORGANIZATION>Family Research Council President TonyPerkins</ORGANIZATION> faulted GOP leaders for trying to quickly shove Akin aside . 
He calledAkin 's comments " indefensible " but noted that " when others have made mistakes , you have n't seen the entire Republican establishment abandon him . 
I think it ' ssomewhat suspect . 
" <PERSON>Perkins</PERSON> compared Akin 's situation to that of former senator <PERSON>George Allen</PERSON> ( R-Va . ) 
, who came under fire during his <DATE>2006</DATE> reelection campaign for calling anaide to his opponent " macaca " but did not face immediate calls to drop <PERSON>out.Phyllis Schlafly</PERSON> , founder of the conservative Eagle Forum , also invoked <PERSON>Allen</PERSON> ' sfate . 
" They 're making a big thing about an unfortunate remark , " she said <DATE>Monday</DATE> , adding later that " the people of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> " should decide whether Akin stays inthe race.ed.okeefe@washingtonpost.comheldermanr@washpost.comHelderman reported from <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION> .
