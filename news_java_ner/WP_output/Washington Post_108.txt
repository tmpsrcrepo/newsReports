TODAY IS MONDAY , and a <DATE>Monday</DATE> presents the fewest hassles for a high schoolsecurity chief , <PERSON>Wally Baranyk</PERSON> will tell you . 
" They come in feeling pretty goodfrom the <DATE>weekend</DATE> and usually not acting like knuckleheads on <DATE>Monday</DATE> , " he says.Knucklehead is one of <ORGANIZATION>Baranyk</ORGANIZATION> 's favorite terms . 
" But it can only get worse fromhere . 
" A retired deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION>Fairfax County Police Department</ORGANIZATION> , the 54-year-oldBaranyk nowadays heads up the four-person security team at <ORGANIZATION>Oakton High School inVienna</ORGANIZATION> , which has never , in his three years there , had a security incident thathe 'd call frightening -- no sexual assaults , no fights that put anybody in ahospital , no teachers attacked , no kids who flipped out and did harm to a group , no gang brawls , no stabbings , no shootings . 
Still , <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> -- which is , by allmeasures , an elite public high school , ranking 104th on <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> 's list of the1 ,200 best public high schools in the country -- is no sanctuary from troubleor anxiety ; no high school nowadays ever is.It is only <TIME>8:45 a.m.</TIME> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> , but already a kid is being asked to visit thesecurity office , not summoned , " just asked to drop by for a little talk , " Baranyk explains . 
" We want to keep it low-key with this kid for now . " 
The kid , he notes , has been in frequent trouble at school , and is now accused by hisex-girlfriend of threatening to beat up another student . 
The situation has grownmore alarming because suspicion is building that the troubled boy may beassociated with a gang and that his threatened foil -- who says he was beatenup by another <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> student just three days earlier -- has ignored a drugdebt ; the story is that he either was given or stole marijuana that belonged toother boys , and has n't paid them back . 
Baranyk would like to bust someone forthe assault , but he does n't have a witness , besides the victim , whosecredibility has never been rock solid . 
Baranyk is hoping , among other things , that the kid coming to his office now might be able to fill in some blanks , inaddition to confessing to his own wrongdoing.The kid arrives . 
He is tall , rangy and agitated-looking . 
Baranyk , a couple ofinches shorter than the kid , gestures at a chair . 
The kid is pacing . 
A thin manmarked as middle-aged by bags under his eyes , Baranyk carries neither a policebaton nor anything else to restrain the unruly . 
But in his cream polo shirt withOakton Security stitched on it , he has the right bearing -- lithe and fit , with taut forearms -- and a manner that says he is unfazed by trouble . 
" Hi , good to see you , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says brightly . 
" How are you ? " 
" I 'm pissed off , " the kid says.Baranyk lets him vent . 
" Like why do I got ta waste my time ? " 
the kid snaps . 
" People lyin ' . 
You know whatI 'm sayin ' ? 
Pissed off . " 
" Gosh , and you 've been doing so well lately , which I 'm proud of , " Baranyk saysgently . 
" Hey , just tell me what 's going on , so I can help . " 
" Everybody knows what happened . 
People are lying and snitching on me . 
" Baranyk says what the kid already knows : Witnesses have claimed he threatened aboy . 
" Oh , man , " the kid groans . 
" You gon na believe that ? " 
" Okay , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says . 
" Let 's just go over what is -- " The kid clucks his tongue and cuts off Baranyk . 
" Listen , listen , listen , man , " he says , wagging a finger . 
" Just listen . 
" Baranyk , ignoring the insubordination , nods . 
" I did n't threaten nobody , man , " the boy says . 
" I was just there . 
" Baranyk nods . 
" Okay , well , you were just there , and what happened ? 
" The kid shrugs . 
He yanks his head back and looks up at the ceiling . 
" I did n'tthreaten . 
I just said to this other dude I 'd watch his back , that 's all . 
I saidI 'd watch his back 'cause [ he and the boy ] were arguing . " 
He lowers his head , looks at <LOCATION>Baranyk</LOCATION> . 
" I did n't do nothing they said I did . 
" Baranyk 's eyes start blinking . 
It is a tic of sorts that sometimes comes overhim during moments of intense concentration , when he is trying to piece togethera puzzle . 
" So what was the argument about ? 
" The boy shrugs . 
" Just arguing , I do n't know . 
" Baranyk says something else that the kid already knows : One of the witnesses washis ex-girlfriend . 
" She 'll say anything , " the boy fumes.Baranyk says that witnesses are accusing him of threatening her , too . 
" Oh , man , " the boy mumbles.Baranyk swings his chair a bit closer . 
" Look , you want to get out of here , right ? " 
he whispers , meaning graduate and get out of high school . 
" Most of allyou want to be gone . 
We both know that . 
Right ? 
" The kid shrugs . 
" Yeah , I 've been trying . " 
" Right now you need -- " The kid interrupts again , yelling : " Come on , man . 
Why are they snitching me out?I was n't assaulting on the kid . 
" It is the first time that either of them has referred to an assault , real orimagined , against the boy who said he was beaten up three days earlier . 
The boyadds : " He got beat up , but I did n't do it . . . I do n't know who did it . " 
" What was this argument about , the one between the two kids that you heard ? " 
" They were just arguing , man . 
" Baranyk decides that is enough for now with the boy . 
He might bring the kid backlater if he ca n't otherwise learn what triggered the assault . 
" Remember what Isaid , " he reminds the boy . 
" Think about how you want to get out of here withyour diploma . 
You -- " The boy , half-listening , talks over <LOCATION>Baranyk</LOCATION> . 
" I 've been assaulted before , but Ido n't snitch anybody out , " he says . 
" I wo n't back down , but I do n't snitchanybody out . 
I -- " Baranyk cuts him off . 
" Hey . " 
The change in <LOCATION>Baranyk</LOCATION> 's tone catches the boy bysurprise . 
" If somebody hits you , you make the good judgment and walk away , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says . 
" Are you listening ? 
" The boy shrugs . 
" Let 's keep doing well , " he says.The boy shakes <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> 's hand and heads out . 
" Hard to know the truth there , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says . 
" He might just be an occasionalknucklehead doing knuckleheaded things . 
I just want to get him out of school byJune ; that 's my goal . 
Sometimes you just want to get them through your schooland get them out . 
" It 's soon 11 o'clock , already time for the first in a series of lunches in thecafeteria . 
There 's usually a fight a week in the <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> cafeteria . 
Today , it ' spretty quiet , and as he walks around , <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> shifts his attention to a kid inan oversize black T-shirt seated alone at the corner of a long table . 
" Hey , what 's up ? " 
Baranyk says to the boy , grinning.The kid stares up at the adult , frozen for an instant . 
" Hey , " he mumbles , lifting a finger in acknowledgment . 
" Good seeing you . " 
Baranyk summons his cheeriest tone . 
" Things good ? " 
" Yeah , " the boy says , looking around.The boy has had a couple of disciplinary problems in classrooms , nothing major , but Baranyk keeps an eye on him , hoping to forge a connection and seeingsomething in the boy he ca n't help but like , some stoicism , perhaps . 
He takes ashort step closer to the kid . 
" Hungry ? " 
he asks , lowering his voice.The boy shakes his head . 
" You had something to eat ? " 
Baranyk asks him.The boy looks up , looks down , talks into his hands . 
" I 'm fine . 
" Baranyk takes a step back . 
He has heard reports from cafeteria workers thatsometimes the boy picks up food from the cafeteria line and conceals it . 
When hefeels himself spotted , the boy puts the food back on the cafeteria counter andwalks away , according to the workers . 
A couple of exasperated employees havetold Baranyk that they ca n't sell the food after the boy has handled it . 
They ' veasked him to intercede.Since he has seldom seen the kid with any money , Baranyk guesses that he ' salmost always broke . 
He occasionally offers the boy a couple of bucks to buyfood , careful not to patronize him by expressing sympathy or by asking aboutthings at home . 
He makes certain that no other students are around when heextends help . 
His discreet approach wins out sometimes . 
On those days , this kidaccepts a couple of dollars and hurries into the cafeteria line ; though othertimes , the kid quietly refuses the money . 
Baranyk will tell him : I 've got aslush fund ; it 's money dropped off at Lost and Found.And that is the truth : At that moment , there 's <MONEY>$ 180</MONEY> in the security department ' sslush fund . 
Ultra-casually , <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says : " I ca n't wait for <DATE>spring</DATE> break . 
Whatare you doin ' on the break ? 
" The kid looks up , pleased by the question . 
" Maybe driving to see some relatives.Maybe . " 
" Hey , that 's great . " 
Baranyk keeps smiling . 
" Great . " 
Baranyk takes a last lookaround , whispers : " Hey , you sure you do n't want a couple bucks from the slushfund ? 
You know me -- I got ta give it away . " 
" I 'm fine , " the kid says firmly . 
" Okay , well , keep doin ' great . 
Good to see you . 
" The boy lifts an index finger.Baranyk 's walkie-talkie reports that " three unidentified young men are runningacross the lawn trying to escape . 
" And , the report adds , a kid is wandering alone outside.The loner concerns him more . 
A couple of weeks earlier , a distraught kid whosegirlfriend had broken up with him dropped to his knees in front of the schooland began pounding his head on a sidewalk . 
He did n't hurt himself badly , butBaranyk still had concerns . 
" In security , we had to ask ourselves : Could thiskid come back to school with a weapon ? 
" Baranyk offers no guarantees about security at <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> . 
" We take every reasonableprecaution , but we 're not a prison , " he says , " and there are ways in and out ofhere , which means there are limits to what we can do . 
" Besides , preventive measures get you only so far with many teenagers . 
By the endof <DATE>Monday</DATE> , <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> is still concerned about the kid who said he was assaulted , and maybe since threatened , determined to get to the bottom of the story byweek 's end . 
He worries that the boy will get beaten up again if he does n'tdisclose what he knows to security . 
But he has no idea how he 's going to getthis kid to talk.Like all <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> public high schools and middle schools , <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> has a singlearmed uniformed officer from the county 's police department on campus -- knownas the school resource officer -- whose responsibilities include arrestingstudent lawbreakers . 
With the school resource officer and his own four-personteam , Baranyk likes security to be seen but not felt , if such a thing ispossible.Oakton High is synonymous in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> area with safety , stability andsuccess . 
Its high-achieving students include a senior girl recently named awinner in a national high school essay contest sponsored by <ORGANIZATION>Oprah Winfrey</ORGANIZATION> . 
Theschool parking lot is sprinkled with the occasional Mercedes and Lexus , andamong the student body have been the children of a congressman and othergovernmental officials . 
Most of its kids , like the surrounding community , aremiddle class , but there are some students from poor and working-class homes , with <PERCENT>9 percent</PERCENT> of students receiving federally funded school lunches . 
Oakton ' smajority is white , but the school has significant blocs of African Americans , Asian Americans and Hispanics . 
More than 400 of the school 's approximately 2,400 students are foreign-born , speaking 45 languages and coming from 83 countries , including <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> , ElSalvador , <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Uzbekistan</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> . 
" We 've been pretty fortunate in most areas , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says of his relativelyserene tenure , which he says has included no spike in the indices that he paysmost attention to -- fights , larceny , drug use and classic bullying . 
" I thinkthis is about as ideal a situation as a public school can have . 
But still . . . " The comfort of working security in the suburbs , he says , can be delusional : Baranyk believes most of the wrongdoing at suburban high schools occurs deep inthe shadows.In the wake of studies showing a national increase in school-based crime andviolence , security personnel made their entrance into many public school systemsduring the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> , including <LOCATION>Fairfax County</LOCATION> , the largest <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> schooldistrict . 
By the mid - <DATE>'90s</DATE> , uniformed and armed police officers had arrived onthe scene in Fairfax.Fairfax 's reputation for secure schools is enhanced whenever mayhem befallsother school districts in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> area . 
The fatal stabbing of a teenagegirl in the parking lot of <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery County</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Blake High School</ORGANIZATION> was just one oftwo deadly teen attacks tied to football games in that county last <DATE>September</DATE> . 
Amonth earlier , two students were stabbed outside <LOCATION>Montgomery</LOCATION> 's Springbrook HighSchool in what reports characterized as a gang-related incident . 
In <DATE>April</DATE> , therewere drive-by shootings of two students just outside the District 's RooseveltHigh School.State agencies in <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> have reported a five-year increase inthe number of weapons confiscated at schools , despite a national trend thatshows a decrease in seized weapons . 
Baranyk has n't had to seize a single gun , knife or shank . 
Oh , once he confiscated a machete from a kid , but that 's onlybecause the kid had brought it as a prop to a drama class . 
Similarly , despitenational worries about youth gangs , <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> has never been plagued by organizedcrews , although <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> believes there are gang members among the students , asevidenced by graffiti that has appeared on campus over the last year.Oakton 's challenges , and approach to security issues , differ strikingly fromthose in many urban school systems . 
The <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> system 's chief of security , <PERSON>Theodore Tuckson</PERSON> , has dealt long enough with gang problems to have createdconflict resolution programs for mediating disputes . 
That school system touts aslogan that encapsulates a multi-pronged anti-gang strategy : " Intervention , Prevention , and Suppression . " 
While much of the rule-breaking at <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> occursout of sight from faculty and staff members , insubordination at <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> schools ismore often on public display . 
" I think our biggest problem here is lack ofrespect by kids for teachers and adults and for other kids , " says <PERSON>MichaelIlwain</PERSON> , a school resource officer at <ORGANIZATION>Eastern High School in NortheastWashington</ORGANIZATION> . 
" It leads to disrespect and bad behavior in classrooms , and it leadsto fights , too . 
Almost all our problems start from there . . . But I also thinkthat , in these times , we have some of the same things to face as other schools . 
" Those things include the spectacularly dire . 
At <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> , as at any other21st-century high school , Baranyk must ponder scenarios that once would havebeen unthinkable . 
He has had to devise meticulous plans for how <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> staffmembers and students would respond in an emergency or a catastrophic event , including a terrorist 's biological or chemical strike , or the spread of apotentially lethal virus . 
" Security at a school means something different nowthan 20 years ago . . . " he says . 
" You can try preparing for problems , but it ' shard to know what they all will look like . . . I guess you 're trying to imaginethe unimaginable . 
" TuesdayThe next morning , Baranyk receives a report that the allegedly assaulted boy hasdisappeared from school.Baranyk , who has heard now that three kids have threatened that boy , suggests toRick <PERSON>Mey</PERSON> , the uniformed school resource officer , that they go looking for him.Before they leave , <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> runs into one of <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> 's assistant principals , <PERSON>MarkPenn</PERSON> , who says he has had a brief conversation with the boy . 
Penn says the boynow has a possible explanation : that he recently found some marijuana at theplayground of a subdivision bordering the school but then threw the drugs away.And perhaps they belonged to his tormentors . 
" This is n't sounding any better , " says <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> , who decides to search someplaygrounds that <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> kids frequent . 
He gets into Mey 's squad car , and the mencruise a few blocks to the first of two townhouse complexes , where they park infront of a small playground with a swing set . 
The kid is not around.After checking out another empty playground at another subdivision , Mey andBaranyk drive a couple of blocks to a bridge that overlooks Interstate 66 . 
Theyget out of the car and scramble down a slope to another known teen hideout . 
Anempty discarded backpack lies in a heap alongside a cigarette pack , a crushedbeer can and an orange juice carton.Baranyk turns to Mey . 
" Where else could we look for this knucklehead ? " 
Meyshrugs.The men climb back up the slope toward the squad car . 
At that moment , the boywhom Baranyk questioned the day before about having allegedly threatened thismissing kid appears out of nowhere , strolling in their direction . 
" Look who 's here , " Baranyk shouts , laughing . 
" Look who 's here . 
" The kid keeps walking toward them . 
" How 're you doing ? " 
Baranyk asks him . 
" Okay , " the kid says calmly . 
" My classes are over . " 
" You seen your buddy walking back here ? " 
Baranyk mentions the missing boy ' sname . 
" We 're lookin ' around for him . 
He really wanted to get out of school forsome reason . 
He was bookin ' it . " 
Baranyk mentions the name again . 
" I do n't know who he is , " this kid says . 
" Really ? " 
" Never heard that name . 
" Baranyk takes a long look at him . 
" All right then . 
Stay straight . 
" Baranyk watches the kid saunter off . 
" That is a very cool kid , " he says softly . 
" But on the other hand it could be , I do n't know , maybe he is n't involved in anyof this . " 
He considers it within the realm of possibility that the missing boy , whom he also regards as clever , has orchestrated these stories about threatsmade against him to bring heat on these other boys , to get them to leave himalone about a drug debt.Baranyk returns to the school and swiftly does a hallway patrol before steppinginto the cafeteria . 
He is pleased to see that the kid to whom he tried givinglunch money yesterday has some company . 
" Hey , " he says to the kid , who is seatedacross a table from a disabled boy Baranyk recognizes , a boy beaten up earlierin the year by a kid since expelled for the assault . 
The disabled boy is happilymunching on a sandwich and jabbering nonstop as the other kid , who has no lunchin front of him for a second straight day , contentedly nods , sometimes smiling.Their friendship was born of trouble : Friends of the bully had continued mockingthe disabled boy long after the assault . 
Baranyk worried that the boy might beattacked again by someone wanting payback for the bully 's expulsion . 
It wasabout then , according to <LOCATION>Baranyk</LOCATION> , that this other kid intervened out of nowhereduring yet another day of mocking , ready to fight in defense of the disabledboy . 
In spite of his duty to prevent such confrontations , the moment revealed astreak of character and compassion that has endeared the protector to Baranyk . 
" You guys look like you 're doing good , " he says . 
" Spring break 's almost here , almost here . 
" When the disabled boy runs off to say hi to somebody else , Baranyk bends . 
" Needanything ? " 
he asks the other kid.A shake of the head.Baranyk smiles , gives him a pat on the shoulder and heads off . 
His walkie-talkiesquawks : The missing boy whom they 'd looked for alongside I-66 is back . 
He wasat <ORGANIZATION>McDonald 's</ORGANIZATION> . 
<PERSON>Wally Baranyk</PERSON> had a rowdy period as a teenager , which he suspects makes iteasier for him to relate to kids who 've run into a little trouble and to believethat most of them will settle down in time . 
Growing up in little <LOCATION>Sayre</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION> , heplayed high school football but also had a fondness for , as he puts it , " raisingsome hell , doing things like egging cars . 
My brothers did , too . " 
The localpolice paid several visits to the Baranyk home . 
" If something happened nearby , the police usually had good reason to think one of the Baranyk boys hadsomething to do with it , " he says sheepishly . 
" Maybe those visits had someeffect on what I did after that . " 
What he did was attend York College inPennsylvania , where he got a degree in criminal justice . 
" I guess I must haveliked the police officers I met , " he says.He 's standing in an <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> hallway , alongside a restroom , watching students walkbetween classes . 
If you want to know something about the difference betweenschool security now and a generation ago , start by watching the restrooms . 
Evenduring breaks , restrooms are relatively quiet at <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> . 
Back when Baranyk wasin high school in the late <DATE>1960s</DATE> , you would enter a crowded boys ' restroom atlunchtime to find music blaring and a nicotine cloud thick enough to rival thatof a good blues club . 
It was the closest thing on school grounds to a bowery.That was in the days before school security specialists like <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> , who cameto <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> after a grueling 27-year career with the <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> police . 
Throughoutthe childhood of his two sons , he worked 60 - to 70-hour weeks , ascending tooversee divisions that included organized crime and narcotics . 
" I was neverreally off duty , " he says . 
The hours took a toll on him . 
" I knew I did n't havethe energy or interest to jump into a chief job somewhere , even if one wereavailable . . . It was time to reassess things . 
" His personal life had reached a crossroads , too : He was going through a divorceand feeling guilty over not spending more time with his sons who , by then , wereteenagers . 
In <DATE>2002</DATE> , he retired from the police department . 
" I needed to find thekind of employment that would enable me to have a life where I could be aroundmy boys as much as possible , " he says . 
" A school seemed like the perfect job . 
" Baranyk got a teaching credential and was hired as a government and historyteacher at <ORGANIZATION>Osbourn High School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Manassas</LOCATION> . 
He lasted a year before deciding thejob was n't for him . 
" I found out I was more comfortable dealing withanti-terrorism than a classroom , " he says.When <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> 's security position came open , in <DATE>2003</DATE> , <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> accepted . 
" It wasjust what I wanted to hear : 194 [ working ] days a year , with summers and schoolvacations off . 
And I get to wear this . 
" He laughs , fingering his <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> Security polo shirt , a uniform underscoring theimpression of a loose and contented man . 
He remarried in <DATE>2004</DATE> and now has twoteenage stepdaughters . 
Not so long ago he imagined that working in a high schoolsecurity office would help him grasp the thinking of the teens living under hisroof , to read their moods and motivations . 
" But , if anything , my working at ahigh school has maybe made it harder to understand them , " he says . 
" Or maybeit 's that I 've begun to think it 's harder to ever understand teenagerscompletely -- because I see so many different kinds of [ incidents ] and kids . 
" What works at <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> does not always work at home , and vice versa . 
He remembersa family dinner during which he told his youngest son , a senior at anotherFairfax high school , about an <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> boy who had received a three-day suspensionfor fighting . 
Missing so much school might jeopardize the suspended kid ' sperformance on tests and , in turn , harm his grades and college admissionchances , <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> said . 
He reminded his son that , if for no other reason , heneeded to avoid fights to protect his own chances.Dad , if somebody is being a jerk and getting in my face , I 'm going to pop him , <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> remembers his son telling him.No , when you 're angry in those situations , you got ta stop and show restraint , Baranyk responded.I 'm going to stand up for myself , Dad . 
" I 'm fortunate , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says . 
" He 's stayed out of trouble , and he 's beenadmitted to a good [ college ] . 
But I 'm also aware that only so much I say isgoing to make it through to him or any other kid that age . 
" When Baranyk talks about teenage life , it sounds like an underworld . 
He hasdeeply personal reasons for wanting to penetrate it , especially when he suspectsthat drugs have entered a kid 's life . 
His youngest brother died under suspiciouscircumstances last month after a 10-year battle with drugs , <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says . 
Hestill struggles to understand where his kin went off the path . 
" I 've had a good life , and my [ other siblings ] have had good lives , but it 's arisk even for a good person once he starts using drugs , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> observes . 
" Itcan be difficult to stop . 
We all warned him to get the hell away from it , but itwas too hard for him . 
He had other problems ; he went the other way . 
It 's one ofthe reasons why I 'm tougher on our students and tougher on my own [ children ] . 
IfI can do anything to keep anybody away from that stuff , I 'm going to do it . 
" He wants to connect however he can . 
Most of the time , this means catchingwrongdoers . 
His resolve can be maniacal when tested , as it was one morningearlier this school year . 
He had been at his home in <LOCATION>Centreville</LOCATION> , gettingdressed for work , when he looked out the window and saw a young man running downhis street and knocking over curbside mailboxes , including <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> 's . 
" I wentoutside , and the guy screamed something crazy at me , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> remembers . 
" Helooked wild ; he looked like he 'd been living in the woods . 
I knew he was ondrugs . " 
Without shoes on , Baranyk started chasing him.The young man was fleet , but <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> stayed close , as he tells the story . 
Hefelt a tad silly conducting a chase along pavement in his socks ; self-consciousness eventually gave way to pain . 
The pursuit consumed the nexthour and 20 minutes , he says , off the streets and into woods . 
Along the way , heoccasionally flagged down motorists . 
" Please call 911 , " he asked . 
" Tell themWally Baranyk is chasing a suspect . 
" A police helicopter was soon circling overhead . 
Now and then , the young manstopped and turned around to see his older pursuer still there . 
He resumedrunning while bellowing painfully at <LOCATION>Baranyk</LOCATION> , who was in his own acute distressby then , his right foot throbbing from stepping on rocks.The young man turned again and screamed at him : " Why are you chasing me ? 
Goaway . " 
" I 'm sorry , I ca n't , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> yelled back.Finally , with the helicopter circling , the young man gave up . 
Baranyk and hisneighbors declined to press charges for the toppled mailboxes , on the conditionthat the young man get himself treated for substance abuse . 
" But making peopleface up to what they 've done and get themselves help is what you have to insistupon , " he says . 
" And to do that you usually have to catch them first . 
" WednesdayBaranyk has gone two days without setting eyes on the kid who said he wasassaulted . 
But today , while walking through the halls between classes , he runsinto him . 
" Hey , there . 
You all right ? 
" The kid , clucking his tongue , exudes surprise . 
" Yeah . 
Fine . 
Why ? " 
" Really ? 
Everything good ? 
" Arching his eyebrows , the boy stares quizzically at Baranyk and sighs every fewseconds . 
He has mastered the passive-aggressive thing . 
" Yeah . 
Why ? " 
" Why were you bookin ' it out of here yesterday ? " 
" I did n't like [ a class ] is all . 
It bores me . " 
" So you do n't like a class , and you just leave ? 
" The kid shrugs . 
" Everything okay with you and these other guys now ? " 
" I do n't care , like , what 's their problem ? " 
the kid says coolly . 
" It 's stupid . 
Ijust wish they 'd leave me alone . " 
" Why wo n't they leave you alone ? 
" The boy takes his time before responding . 
" I do n't know , " he mutters.Baranyk steps closer to the boy and bends to eye level . 
" You know , you do n't owethese kids anything . 
So if you have a disagreement with them -- if you need tocome to us and let us know something they 're doing to you , then you should doit . 
They have n't been friends to you . 
You do n't owe them anything . 
So if there ' sanything to tell us -- " " There is n't . " 
The kid drops his head . 
" It 's fine . 
I can take care of it . " 
" You know we 're always here to help you . " 
Baranyk says this so earnestly thatthe kid lifts his head and looks him over for a moment . 
" Always here . 
You shouldknow that . 
" Maybe the security team can still reach him , Baranyk thinks , which in this casewould mean getting the boy to ask for help and spill the entire story . 
Orperhaps some eyewitness -- say , a disgusted buddy who overheard somethingbetween the other boys involved -- will come forward . 
As in his police days , Baranyk will promise to give anonymity to any informer . 
Without that pledge , hesays , many of his best sources of information at <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> would have dried up longago , just as on the streets.Except here , different rules apply . 
Having a circle of students confidentiallyfeeding him information also means that Baranyk sometimes hears painedadmissions from kids about their own lives . 
" If kids let me know they 've donesomething knuckleheaded , and they 've come to me in confidence , then what do Ido ? " 
he asks . 
" My feeling is that if it 's an immediate health issue or problem , I will call [ the students ' parents ] . 
Otherwise it 's a judgment call . 
If I calleda parent each and every time somebody confided , then those students would nevertalk to me again . 
And if I did it , and word got out about it to the rest of theschool , no other student would talk to me , either . 
" Later , a girl approaches and taps him on the arm . 
" What 's up ? " 
he asks.She shows off her scanty tank top , whining when <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says that her baremidriff violates the dress code . 
" Hey , I need to tell you something , " she says . 
" What ? 
" She whispers something to him . 
" Okay , thanks , " he says as she walks off . 
She has given him news about somethinghappening on campus.Even with his resolve and his sources , Baranyk ca n't hear about everything . 
In ahallway , near the school trophy case , a 16-year-old junior , with his handsplunged into the pockets of his jeans , walks by and says hi . 
" He 's pretty cool , " the boy later says of Baranyk . 
" People like to be helpful to him . 
But this is abig place . 
Kids know he and the other security guys ca n't be everywhere . 
" The main building at <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> has two floors , and the boy says students know thatthe security personnel , whose office is on the first floor , spend far less oftheir time patrolling the hallways on the upper level . 
" Security worries aboutstudents trying to get off campus , but a lot of kids do n't even try to get offcampus when they skip [ classes ] , " he says . 
" Sometimes they just skip and hangout upstairs because they know security does n't come up there as much . 
" Upstairs is a tougher world , he says . 
" Sometimes kids get shoved around up thereby bigger kids , but that 's just high school , right ? 
" Even when an altercation is happening on the floor where Baranyk and hiscolleagues are patrolling , the boy says that security often does n't see it . 
" Iftwo kids want to fight inside the school , " he explains , " they go to the end of ahallway , as far away as they can get from security , and then their friends getin a circle around them . 
That way it 's harder for security and teachers to seethem fighting . 
See , security wants to catch kids , but kids are looking around atwhat security does , too . 
They can be tricky , like security . 
" The caginess also applies to the way students deal with one another , he says.The boy does n't hear students talking about their own drug use at <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> . 
Stiffpenalties for possession of drugs have had an impact . 
" You hear gossip aboutother people , but it 's from guys talking about rumors of people in other groupsthey do n't really know , " he says . 
" You really only know what 's happening in yourown group . . . Security knows a lot more about drugs than kids do . 
It 's weird : Security finds out somehow . 
People probably talk to them . 
Mr. <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> knows howto get information . 
" Baranyk is dogged about intelligence gathering . 
Using the Internet , he and RickMey have scanned <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> students ' MySpace.com sites , which , in some cases , offera window into their thoughts and activities.He will be able to point , within the next couple of weeks , to an incident inKansas , where sheriff 's deputies , alerted by a MySpace.com posting , arrestedfive teenage boys allegedly plotting to shoot high school classmates on <DATE>April20</DATE> , the seventh anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION>Columbine</ORGANIZATION> murders . 
But <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> 's principalinterest in MySpace.com and the rest of his investigative tools is far lesssensational : He is looking for any <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> High lawbreaker or dangerousrisk-taker who needs to be rescued . 
" You want to help them , and you need to holdthem accountable , " he says . 
" But you do n't want to see their lives harmed bybeing caught , either . 
" When his walkie-talkie squawks , he is off to look into a new bit of chicanery : Ateacher has reported that he saw a boy with a " teacher 's textbook , " which hasanswers to homework questions and possible examination topics . 
The book inquestion is not from this teacher 's class . 
It is used by a government teacherwho , since told of the allegation , has met Baranyk in the hallway outside hisclassroom . 
" Would you like me to talk to the student ? " 
Baranyk asks him . 
" I 'd appreciate that , " the teacher replies . 
" I 'll wait for him out here , " Baranyk says.The teacher steps back into the room and walks over to the boy , who looksstunned when asked to get up from his desk and speak to Baranyk . 
" Am I in trouble for something ? " 
the boy asks , in the hallway . 
" I certainly hope not , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says casually , leading him toward the securityoffice.Once there , <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> conducts his interrogation at warp speed . 
" The witnesses inthis are teachers , and I have some leeway , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says , " but if you lie thatshuts the door on you . 
All right ? 
" The boy nods.Baranyk moves his chair closer . 
" You have a teacher 's government textbook , according to a witness . 
I got ta have that book back , and I got ta know how yougot it , or there 's a possibility you do n't graduate . 
If it 's a theft and there ' sany lying by you , you might be looking at a felony , too . 
Okay ? 
How did you getthe book ? " 
" I got it from a friend , " the kid answers . 
" I gave it back to him . 
He got itonline . " 
" Who 's your friend ? 
" The boy supplies a name . 
" I 'm proud of you for being honest , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says to the kid . 
" It is n't fatalwhat you 've done . 
I 'm sure there 'll be some repercussions with your teacher , butyou 'll be all right with us . 
" Within a few minutes , <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> is headed back toward the same class , ready topluck a second boy from his desk . 
He likes to spare administrators and teachersthe task of questioning students , in no small part because he has seen enough oftheir soft interrogations to know it is not one of their greatest strengths . 
Thesecond boy is not in the classroom now , having just moments before secured apass for himself from the unsuspecting teacher . 
" What a knucklehead this kid is , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says , hurrying down a hallway . 
" I betwhen he saw me take [ the first boy ] , he decided he needed to get out of there . 
" Baranyk peers down hallways , pops into a boys ' restroom . 
There , stepping awayfrom a toilet stall , is the boy , alone . 
" I 'm here because of this government book , this teacher 's book , that you got , " Baranyk says . 
" What ? " 
the kid asks innocently.They are standing in the middle of the restroom . 
The boy is beginning to saysomething , but <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> cuts him off . 
" This is n't a time to BS me , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says.In a flash , his typically soft voice , the one so useful in extractinginformation from students during gentle interrogations , can give way to thetough cop voice from his past . 
" You understand me ? " 
Baranyk goes on . 
" Look , ifwe leave this bathroom without the truth , you 'll have to sit down with [ anassistant principal ] . 
You do n't want to have to go through that . 
It will get badthen . 
You 're here now , and maybe I can help , but this is your only chance . 
Ifyou BS me , that door is shut . 
Shut . 
You have to think about graduating , right?Right ? 
So where did you get the book ? 
" The boy 's upper lip trembles . 
" I got it three days ago . 
Online . " 
" Why did you do that ? 
" The boy shrugs . 
" Where is it now ? " 
" At home . 
I threw it in a trash can . 
I did n't want anybody else to find it . " 
" If you 're BS-ing , and I search your book bag and locker and it 's in there , <ORGANIZATION>Ica</ORGANIZATION> n't help you . 
" The boy 's chest heaves . 
" It 's really in the trash . 
" Baranyk looks the boy over . 
" Lots of other kids have them , " the boy adds . 
" They 're getting them online , too . 
" Baranyk sends the boy on his way . 
There will be no suspensions . 
Baranyk willpass the information about the compromised lesson plan on to the teacher , whowill flunk the two kids on some homework assignments and consider deductingpoints from their next exam.Late in the day , <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> walks by his office to hear an update : The assaultedboy 's mother has called a vice principal to express her growing concern for him.To Baranyk , this update seems a portent of more trouble . 
He sighs . 
" Knucklehead , " he mumbles . 
At the other end of the hallway , smirking staffmembers are motioning for him . 
" What 's going on ? " 
he asks . 
" They 've wrapped condoms around the water faucets again , <PERSON>Wally</PERSON> . " 
" It only happens every few weeks or so , so we can live with it , " <PERSON>Baranykwhispers</PERSON> . 
" Rumor is it 's some kids ' way of promoting safe sex . 
That 's anexpensive hobby , if you ask me . 
" One of the nice things about <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> , he points out , is that weird humor is in noshort supply . 
" You know , when it comes to workplaces , I do n't think anything canbeat a school , " he observes . 
He looks at his watch : It is nearly 3 o'clock , theend of his workday . 
" Another thing about this job , " he says , " the hours aregreat . 
" ThursdayLate <TIME>this morning</TIME> , assistant principal Mark <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> asks Baranyk to join him in ahastily called meeting with the boy who said he was assaulted . 
When the teenagerarrives , he is twitchy , flicking at his earring . 
" Have you had any more problems with anybody ? " 
Penn asks . 
" Not really , but I do n't know why they [ the two boys suspected of assaultinghim ] do n't just leave me alone , " the boy says , staring at his feet.Penn glances at Baranyk and then back at the boy . 
" We received an e-mail fromyour mother . 
Something happened at your house . 
" The boy looks up.Penn tells him that , according to his mother , somebody has vandalized the boy ' scar . 
Penn scans the mother 's e-mail : " What she 's saying here is that there 's asmashed car window . 
" The boy howls an expletive.Penn goes on : " She 's also saying that you rushed out of your house early thismorning . . . " The boy does n't seem to have heard what <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> said . 
" That 's my car , that 's mycar . " 
He screams the expletive again . 
" Did you know about any of this with the car ? " 
Penn asks . 
" No , " the boy moans . 
" She 's concerned that you might have left <TIME>this morning</TIME> without taking yourmedicine , " <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> says.The boy cups his head in his hands . 
" My car , my car , " he mumbles . 
" She 's concerned you did n't take your medicine . 
" The boy is bipolar and regularly takes prescribed lithium . 
" No , I took it , " hewhispers , calming , lifting his head . 
" Why did they do that to my car ? " 
" Your mom says that she hopes a counselor will talk to you so that you candecompress , " <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> goes on . 
" Would it help you to be able to see your counselor ? " 
" No . 
Why did they do that to my car ? 
" No one answers him . 
<LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> are hoping he 'll answer his own question.The boy takes a breath . 
" Do n't worry , I 'll handle it , " he says.That makes <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> 's head whip around . 
" Do n't confront anybody , " <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> warns . 
" Do n't make things worse . 
" Baranyk slices in . 
" Why would someone smash your car window ? 
" The boy answers slowly . 
One of the two boys suspected of assaulting him " waspissed at me for snitching that there was an assault . 
He was pissed because ifhe gets in any more trouble , maybe he 'll have to go to a [ juvenile detentionfacility ] . 
It 's like a warning : Do n't snitch again . 
Do n't snitch about anythingelse . 
" Baranyk 's eyes are rapidly blinking . 
" Snitch about what else ? " 
" Assaulting . 
" This is n't what Baranyk is looking for . 
The conversation is over , at least fornow.Alone , <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> try to figure out the next move , if there is a nextmove . 
" It 's getting more serious , " <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> says . 
" They 're not going to stop coming afterhim , I do n't think . 
" In the afternoon , wearing a dark suit , <ORGANIZATION>Baranyk</ORGANIZATION> makes a short drive to a FairfaxCounty school district office , where separate disciplinary hearings will be heldfor two <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> girls . 
The first , a senior , is charged with bringing a drug toschool -- a painkiller prescribed to her -- and giving it to anotherstudent . 
The other girl , an underclassman , is accused of possessing not only thepainkiller but a small quantity of marijuana found in a search of herbelongings . 
Weeks earlier , another student heard rumors that the senior with thepainkiller was offering the drug to another girl . 
The student shared the storywith an adult , who passed it along to the school . 
From the beginning of thecase , <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> and his team have worried about its impact on the senior , who , having turned 18 , can no longer be treated as a juvenile by the justice system.On the day of the bust , having admitted to distributing a drug , the girl facedthe possibility of a felony charge . 
But <PERSON>Mey</PERSON> says he pointed out to a countyprosecutor that no money had exchanged hands , and the prosecutor decided not topursue a criminal case.Today , each of the hearings will last a little over an hour . 
The younger girl ' ssession is first , and she emerges teary-eyed afterward . 
On the family 's way out , the mother murmurs , " Thank you " to Baranyk . 
He recounts how the parentsexpressed gratitude that their daughter 's marijuana use had been exposed . 
Thehearing officer 's decision will not come for a week , at which time the youngergirl will be assigned to a new high school in the county . 
The senior who gaveher the painkiller will be barred from attending classes at <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> but permittedto finish her course work at home and graduate on time . 
The incident will berecorded on each girl 's permanent school record . 
But <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> and county schoolofficials believe that the incident will not harm either girl 's collegeadmission chances . 
They say colleges seldom request more than a student ' sgrades . 
" They get to move ahead , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says . 
" Their lives will be better because thetruth is out . 
" FridayIn the <TIME>morning</TIME> , several members of the staff surprise Baranyk by wishing him ahappy 54th birthday . 
One woman drapes a lei around his neck . 
Others take turnsgiving him chaste hugs and kisses on the cheek . 
" Ladies , I never got anythinglike this in the police department , " he says , grinning.Once away from them , he wonders aloud , " Well , what 's gon na happen today ? " 
Healways has a conflicted feeling about <DATE>Friday</DATE> at <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> . 
On the one hand , aweekend break awaits ; on the other , he can sense tension in the air , the nervesof some edgy students fraying after a week under the school grind.During his lunchtime patrol of the cafeteria , he looks for the kid who seldomeats , happy today to find that he is munching on a sandwich and sitting acrossfrom the disabled boy . 
" Hey , Mr. <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> , " the first kid calls out . 
He says hehas some <DATE>spring</DATE> break news . 
" I 'm taking that trip , " the boy says , grinning crookedly . 
" Driving to see myrelatives and some old friends . " 
" Good for you , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says . 
" Nothing better than <DATE>spring</DATE> break , huh ? " 
" One more week , " the boy says.In the cafeteria and elsewhere on campus , there are no altercations today , andtherefore , remarkably , no fights all week . 
For the first time in months atOakton , it will be a week without a student suspension . 
By all appearances , everything is tranquil.But even on a day as quiet as this <DATE>Friday</DATE> , the worried keep trickling in . 
Astricken-looking administrator stops Baranyk in the hallway to share a reportabout a girl who has been having " meltdowns " in her classes and , according towhispers , talking about suicide . 
Baranyk says he 'll be sure to brief thecounselor.Next a German teacher rushes into the office and says that somebody in her classhas stolen one of her teacher textbooks with exam answers . 
Baranyk agrees totalk to her students . 
His voice , imperious and loud , will carry right throughthe door of the classroom . 
" Look , " he says to all of them . 
" The person who took that book can turn it in <DATE>byMonday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> , with no questions asked . 
But , if that does n't happen , I will seeto it that all 26 students in this class are interrogated , and I will get thatbook , and the student responsible will be dealt with . 
Understand me : One way oranother , I will get the book . 
" By <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> , the book will be there.But for now , another week is over for Baranyk . 
As he gets ready to leave for theweekend , he runs into <PERSON>Mark Penn</PERSON> , each wondering whether the other has heard moreabout the stealth life of the supposedly assaulted boy . 
Baranyk shakes his head . 
" Nothing 's changed , " <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> says . 
" It 's all so unclear . 
He went missing fromanother class . " 
" I do n't know if he 's any safer on a weekend , " <PERSON>Baranyk</PERSON> says . 
" Maybe not . 
" In the hallway , the men see the smiling principal , <PERSON>John Banbury</PERSON> , who says : " Well , this was a calm week , was n't it ? 
Did I hear right ? 
No suspensions ? 
" <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> nods . 
" We were just talking about it : no fights , no suspensions . 
" Baranyk concurs . 
" A very calm week .
