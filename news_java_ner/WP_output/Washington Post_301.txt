But this year the <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> nominees were , well , lame.So , desperate <ORGANIZATION>Cosmo</ORGANIZATION> staffers called up a <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown</ORGANIZATION> modeling agency , T.H.E. , andasked to see head shots of its best beefcake . 
That 's how 23-year-old KevinArcher was chosen . 
So should <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> women despair of getting guys ? 
" There 's a ton of eligible bachelors in <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> I do n't think it says anythingabout <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> and the lack of bachelors , " <PERSON>Archer</PERSON> told us yesterday . 
A graduate ofSt . 
John 's <ORGANIZATION>College High School</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Syracuse University</ORGANIZATION> ( where he got a degree inhealth and exercise science ) , he said he 's honored to be named a best bachelor , no matter how the magazine found him.Cosmo editor <PERSON>Kate White</PERSON> told us : " Some of the guys are so good-looking theyshould be models , and some actually are . 
" A buff 6-footer , <PERSON>Archer</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Cosmo</ORGANIZATION> that he 's looking for a woman " who isdown-to-earth and goal-oriented and who also knows how to have a good time . " 
Headded that he likes a woman who has " natural beauty , not someone who wears a tonof makeup . " 
In the three weeks since the issue hit newsstands , <PERSON>Archer</PERSON> has beencontacted by several women -- including one from <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> . 
Interested females havealso sent letters to an address listed in the magazine .

" The Perils of PaulaAn angry Paula Jones phoned from <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> yesterday to rebut our report that shetried and failed to get into two <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON> campaign events in Little Rockthis week . 
" I do n't know who your ' reliable sources ' are , but this is not true , " said history 's most famous sexual harassment plaintiff.Jones insisted that she was nowhere near a <DATE>Monday</DATE> morning <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> speech at <ORGANIZATION>LittleRock 's Centers for Youth</ORGANIZATION> and Families ( contrary to what Little Rock journalistSuzi <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> told us ) and though she was at the <ORGANIZATION>Embassy</ORGANIZATION> Suites she did n't attemptto crash a lunchtime fundraiser there ( contrary to what <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> campaign presssecretary <PERSON>Ari Fleischer</PERSON> told us ) . 
What 's more , Jones strenuously objected toParker 's assertion that she " was dressed like <ORGANIZATION>Daisy Mae</ORGANIZATION> , in a very revealinglow-cut thing , and said she wanted to meet the governor . " 
" I was not wearing anything low-cut , " <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> said . 
" I was wearing bluejeans and aGap baseball cap and a <PERSON>Tommy Hilfiger</PERSON> T-shirt that came up to my neck bone . 
Idid n't want to be noticed at all , and honestly I thought I could get away withit . 
If I wanted to be noticed , I 'd show up looking beautiful and I 'd wear a nicebeautiful suit . 
" After talking it over with Jones yesterday , <PERSON>Parker</PERSON> conceded that the woman shesaw on <DATE>Monday</DATE> " looked like her and acted like her -- but it must not have beenher . 
" <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> said she went to the <ORGANIZATION>Embassy</ORGANIZATION> Suites with two friends , <PERSON>Teresa McLemore andDebbie Ballentine</PERSON> . 
" Debbie wanted me to go . 
She 's a big fan of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> . 
We did notbother to try and get in and we were not turned away . 
We just stayed outsidemeeting people , and afterwards the three of us went out to lunch . 
It looks likepeople are turning this around to say I 'm trying to meet the governor . 
Well , yeah , so what ? 
I have a right to meet the governor just like anybody else . 
" Jones added : " My lawsuit was settled over a year ago , and I still ca n't go outto a concert or anything without something being in the papers the next day . 
I ' ma normal person like anybody and I have a right to go out and have a good time.What am I gon na do , stay a recluse ?
