There are so many jaw-dropping accusations in the new indictmentof <PERSON>Anne ArundelCounty</PERSON> Executive <PERSON>John R. Leopold</PERSON> that it 's hard to pick the most outrageous.Is it the <MONEY>$ 10,000</MONEY> in police overtime ? 
That was the county taxpayers ' bill soLeopold 's personal security detail could stand watch at a hospital to preventhis live-in girlfriend from meeting his other girlfriend , a county governmentsubordinate.Or how about the allegation that <PERSON>Leopold</PERSON> ( R ) required the police officers toempty his urine bag when he was using a catheter because of back surgery ? 
( Yuck . ) 
The charges , brought by a state grand jury <DATE>Friday</DATE> , certainly represent the mostserious threat yet to <PERSON>Leopold</PERSON> 's long political career . 
But he has surviveddisagreeable controversies before , and voters have repeatedly passed judgment inhis favor.This is the guy , remember , who easily won reelection in <DATE>2010</DATE> - a year afterpolice found him in the back seat of his <ORGANIZATION>Chevrolet Impala</ORGANIZATION> following a 911 callreporting two naked people having sex in a car . 
It was parked near the Nordstromstore in busy <ORGANIZATION>Westfield Annapolis Shopping</ORGANIZATION> Mall.The voters also were n't moved by a complaint against Leopold from female countyemployees alleging gender discrimination and sexual harassment . 
One former aidesaid that <PERSON>Leopold</PERSON> asked her to track down attractive women he had met atcommunity and political gatherings and ask them to meet with him . 
" The voters were well aware of those allegations but reelected me handily , " <PERSON>Leopold</PERSON> said in a telephone interview <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> . 
" Some said it 's not true . 
Otherssaid it may be true , but he 's done a great job and we 're going to reelect himanyway . 
" Leopold , 69 , has remained popular partly by holding down property and incometaxes . 
He also has shown painstaking devotion to constituent services - fixingroads , reducing neighborhood noise and adding streetlights.Leopold also was lucky to face weak and divided opposition when he ran forreelection in <DATE>2010</DATE> . 
The Democrats nominated a relatively inexperiencedcandidate , whose support was diluted by defectors to a <ORGANIZATION>Green Party</ORGANIZATION> candidate . 
" The electorate of <LOCATION>Anne Arundel County</LOCATION> is tossed with indecision . 
They do n'tmind the way he 's governed . 
They wish he were more solid personally , and did n'thave the patina of impropriety , " said <PERSON>Dan Nataf</PERSON> , director of the Center of theStudy of Local Issues at <ORGANIZATION>Anne Arundel Community College.Others</ORGANIZATION> say that if President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> did n't have to resign after the MonicaLewinsky scandal , then <PERSON>Leopold</PERSON> can survive this . 
" There 's a whole new set of rules since <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> . 
You can get away with stuffthat would have buried you before , " said former county executive <PERSON>O. JamesLighthizer.Nevertheless</PERSON> , there are three major reasons why this scandal could mean muchmore trouble for Leopold than anything he 's faced in the past.First , he has n't been charged with crimes before . 
He faces one count offraudulent misappropriation , a misdemeanor that carries a jail term of one tofive years , and four counts of official misconduct.The <ORGANIZATION>Nordstrom</ORGANIZATION> parking lot incident did n't lead to charges . 
The female employeesfiled a civil complaint , not a criminal one . 
( It 's still tied up in court . ) 
Second , it seems clear from the indictment that the accusations come from one ormore of the police officers assigned to his security detail . 
The grand juryheard testimony from at least three officers a year ago . 
Police officers can bepretty sympathetic witnesses , especially when they 've been asked by politiciansto do tawdry personal tasks.The <ORGANIZATION>Fraternal Order of Police</ORGANIZATION> has weighed in on the side of the officers . 
<DATE>OnMonday</DATE> , it publicly called on Leopold and Police Chief <PERSON>James Teare</PERSON> to resign . 
Itaccused Teare of not supporting his officers when they complained to him aboutLeopold 's behavior.Finally , and perhaps most important , the charges focus less on sexualmisbehavior and more on inappropriate use of police officers . 
The public is morelikely to be unhappy about misspending public resources than personalimmorality.That concern , on top of past ones , could be enough to finally spoil Leopold ' sstanding with the voters . 
" There 's a narrative that he 's got personal judgment issues , " <PERSON>Nataf</PERSON> said . 
" There 's smoke there , and you 've got to wonder if there 's fire .
