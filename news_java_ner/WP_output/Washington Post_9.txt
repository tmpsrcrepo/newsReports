You know how you can get all wrapped up in a good <DATE>summer</DATE> novel and have toremind yourself where you are when you put it down?Well , <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> has made it pretty hard this past week to remind myself that we donot , in fact , live in the brutal 18th-century society I 'm reading about , whererape is unacknowledged and young women are treated as disposable.Let 's take a look at <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> <DATE>last week</DATE> , where a former teacher was sentenced tojust 30 days in jail after admitting to raping a 14-year-old student , who laterkilled herself.The <ORGANIZATION>Yellowstone County</ORGANIZATION> judge said the girl was " older than her chronologicalage " and " as much in control of the situation " as the teacher , who was 49 at thetime of the ongoing rapes.Later in the week , after he was slammed across the country , <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> DistrictJudge <PERSON>G. Todd Baugh</PERSON> issued a statement apologizing for his comments . 
That did n'tchange the ridiculous sentence.But that 's <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> , you think . 
The judge wears a bolo tie , what can you expect?Okay , so let 's go to <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> , our enlightened nation 's capital.Here in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , defense attorneys in a military hearing have made theirpoint loud and clear that if you report a sexual assault , they will make yourlife hell.A <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Naval Academy</ORGANIZATION> midshipman who says she was raped by three fellow studentslast year finally had her case acknowledged by the academy . 
And she was ravagedby the attorneys of the defendants.They asked her whether she was wearing a bra or panties that night . 
They askedher to describe how wide she opens her mouth during oral sex . 
They asked her ifshe " felt like a ho " the next morning.What ? 
An attorney said " ho " in a hearing?It sounded like a witch trial . 
But her interrogation , which ended <DATE>Sunday</DATE> , cameat an Article 32 hearing , which is the military equivalent of a grand juryhearing to determine whether the case would go to trial , or in this case , amilitary court-martial . 
The woman said she went to an off-campus " toga and yoga " party at the footballhouse last <DATE>spring</DATE> . 
She drank way too much and blacked out . 
The next morning , herback was sore and she did n't remember much . 
She did n't report anything . 
" She learned from friends and social media that three football players wereclaiming to have had sexual intercourse with her while she was incapacitated , " her attorney , <PERSON>Susan Burke</PERSON> , said in a statement when I wrote about the case inJune.It was her fellow classmates , who were horrified by the online bragging of thethree football players , who reported the case.Reluctantly , the woman told academy officials what she could remember . 
What didthe academy do ? 
They punished the 21-year-old for drinking.She and her attorney began to wonder if the academy would ever investigate theplayers.Now , the defense attorneys are trying to make her regret that the case ever gotthis far.The questions have been invasive , irrelevant and demeaning.Legal experts say they would never be able to go that far - the sexual-positionquestions , the cross-examination about her underpants - in a civilian trial.Perhaps this cultural difference explains a recent <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> report , which statedthat while as many as 26,000 service members said they were the targets ofunwanted sexual contact last year , only 3,374 incidents of sexual assault werereported.Those who believe women should be kept out of the military will point to thereport and the <ORGANIZATION>Naval Academy</ORGANIZATION> case as proof . 
But hold your horses there , InternetRousseaus.The <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> report also said that the majority - <PERCENT>53 percent</PERCENT> - of the people whosaid they were assaulted were men . 
And they were assaulted by other men.Take the case of <PERSON>Greg Jeloudov</PERSON> , who told <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> that two weeks after he joinedthe military in <DATE>2009</DATE> , he was gang-raped in the barracks by men who said theywere showing him who was in charge . 
" It must have been your fault . 
You must have provoked them , " is what he saidcommanders told him.Imagine the grilling he would have faced if they took his report seriously . 
" Did you ever walk out of the showers with your shirt off ? " 
" Did you ever talkabout sex with your bunkmates ? " 
" Did you ever watch porn with other men ? 
" Nope , at least 10,000 men would n't go there , would n't report a sexual assault.The <ORGANIZATION>Naval Academy</ORGANIZATION> case underscores the reasons behind the rising concern overthe way the military handles sexual assault cases.But this is n't about women in the military . 
It is n't about the hidden sexualassault of men in the military . 
Nor is it about a backward judge in YellowstoneCounty.It 's about <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> still not understanding the difference between consensual sexand rape.The woman at the <ORGANIZATION>Naval Academy</ORGANIZATION> is not pretending to be a prude . 
She describedfor attorneys times in the past when she did want to have sex and consented toit . 
But the stuff those football players bragged about online - she did n't evenremember it . 
At that point , it 's rape.Consensual sex happens between two adults who both want it.Rape is about violence , domination and power.It should n't be that hard.And yet , it still is .
