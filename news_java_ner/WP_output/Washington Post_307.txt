Dickeyexits the <ORGANIZATION>http://stats.washingtonpost.com/mlb/teamreports.asp?tm=21&report=teamhome-URL-New York Mets</ORGANIZATION> ' <PERSON>Pentagon Cityhotel</PERSON> , jaywalks across <LOCATION>South Hayes Street</LOCATION> and makes his way underground to theMetro platform . 
" This thing , " he grumbles , stepping gingerly down the brokenescalator , " is never working . " 
He 's not in a bad mood , per se - just a seriousone.It is <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> , and <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> , 37 , is headed to a therapy session - relationship therapy . 
<PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> and his knuckleball , they are making great progressthese days , their understanding of each other growing deeper and richer . 
But thework must never stop , lest they drift apart again . 
Later that afternoon , in thebullpen at <LOCATION>Nationals Park</LOCATION> , they will take their places and pick up where theyleft off last time . 
" It 's definitely a relationship , " <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> , who carries the best record in theNational League ( 8-1 ) into <DATE>Thursday</DATE> 's start against the http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nationals-URL-Nationals , says before throwing hisstandard , between-starts bullpen session . 
" Sometimes we fight . 
There will betimes where I 'm yelling at the baseball - like , ' Do I really know you ? ' 
" That 's what keeps me invested . 
[ The knuckleball ] can grow . 
It 's not just aninanimate thing . 
It 's very much a living thing . 
It 's very organic . 
" The relationship between <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> and his knuckleball was n't always at this loftyplace , with <ORGANIZATION>Dickey</ORGANIZATION> holding a 2.69 Ã¢ [ #x 2c6 ] [ #x 161 ] earned run average roughly athird of the way through the season . 
Theirs was an arranged marriage - forcedupon them seven years ago by the management of the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Rangers</ORGANIZATION> , who notedDickey 's expanding ERA and declining velocity , and suggested , in no uncertainterms , that for the sake of his own career he reinvent himself as aknuckleballer . 
" It 's important to be honest about what you 're not good at , " <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> says . 
" Whenthe Rangers came to me and said , ' We do n't think you can do it anymore as aconventional pitcher , ' there were 29 other teams out there that I could havetaken my chances with . 
But I identified in myself that I was n't good enough , Iwas very mediocre . . . . I like truth . 
I 'm drawn to it in an effort to grow as aperson . 
A big part of that is self-awareness . 
" The flight of the pitch is the perfect metaphor for my life anyway - the upsand downs , the grappling with it , the chaos of it . 
" A belief in redemptionDickey is , without question , the Most Interesting Man in Baseball . 
It is n't justthat he speaks of his primary pitch as if it were a living , breathing thing , orof his development of that pitch as a relationship - but it is partly that . 
Heis the only knuckleball pitcher left in the majors , and only a knuckleballerwould speak in such a way.But he is also a voracious reader of Big , Important Books ( for example , " My Nameis Asher Lev , " by <PERSON>Chaim Potok</PERSON> ; " Life of Pi , " by <PERSON>Yann Martel</PERSON> ) , a former Englishmajor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Tennessee</ORGANIZATION> , a born-again Christian and an avidbicyclist . 
This past winter , he climbed <LOCATION>Mount Kilimanjaro</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> - despitethe Mets threatening to void his contract if anything happened to him - tellingNew York magazine , " The scope of the mountain resonated with me . 
" He is also a medical marvel , possessing no ulnar collateral ligament in histhrowing elbow , which first came to light after the <ORGANIZATION>Rangers</ORGANIZATION> drafted him in <DATE>1996</DATE> - doctors concluded either he was born without it , or it disintegrated duringhis youth - and which cost him a small fortune , since the <ORGANIZATION>Rangers</ORGANIZATION> lowered theirsigning-bonus offer from <MONEY>$ 810,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$ 75,000</MONEY> upon discovering the missingligament.And this <DATE>spring</DATE> , he became an author , releasing an autobiography , " Wherever IWind Up : My Quest For Truth , Authenticity and the Perfect Knuckleball , " that onereviewer called the " best non-fiction baseball book since <PERSON>Jim Bouton</PERSON> 's ' BallFour . ' 
" Most media accounts of <ORGANIZATION>Dickey</ORGANIZATION> 's book focused on its salacious revelations - themultiple episodes of sexual abuse that <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> suffered as an 8-year-old ; themarital infidelity <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> inflicted upon his wife , <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> ( with whom he remainsmarried , with four kids ) ; and his discovery of a syringe on the <ORGANIZATION>Rangers</ORGANIZATION> ' clubhouse floor in <DATE>2001</DATE> . 
" I certainly believe in redemption , " <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> says of his decision to be soforthcoming in the book . 
" Hope and redemption go hand in hand , but in order toget to redemption you have to walk through quite a bit of darkness , and for me , being honest about a past that was difficult and dark is part of the process ofbecoming fully me . 
" But at its core , the book is a tale of twin journeys , those of his professionallife and his personal life , that both reached tipping points when he was in hisearly 30s - and that , as <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> discovered , were not actually separate journeys , but facets of the same one . 
" Do you think that it 's a coincidence that when I was finally able to stophiding as a human being , I also stopped hiding as a pitcher ? " 
Dickey wrote . 
" Ido n't . 
" A chance to exploreThe Most Interesting Man in Baseball steps off his Yellow Line train at theL ' Enfant Plaza Metro stop , walks across the overpass and climbs down to theplatform to catch the Green Line to the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Yard/Nationals Park stop . 
Not oneperson appears to recognize him during the approximately 20-minute ride from theteam hotel to the stadium.Dickey is a connoisseur of urban subway systems , riding them in any road citywhere there 's a stop at the ballpark , and at even at home in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> . 
" NewYork 's subway system , " he marvels , " is the eighth wonder of the world . 
" He mentions the <LOCATION>San Francisco Bay Area</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> amonghis favorite subway systems on the road , although nothing , he said , compares tothe old Canadian cities of the <ORGANIZATION>Pacific Coast League</ORGANIZATION> - <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Edmonton</LOCATION> andVancouver , none of which remain in the <ORGANIZATION>PCL</ORGANIZATION> . 
" <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION> , now that was an awesome subway system , " he says . 
" You 'd ride to thestadium , get a table at an outdoor cafe downtown , and ride back to your hotel . 
" Dickey values both the opportunity to explore a city the way the locals getaround , and the element of adventure it brings . 
He has gotten lost more thanonce . 
One time , in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , he switched to the wrong train , ascended to thestreet level to get his bearings and found himself outside of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. HolocaustMemorial Museum</ORGANIZATION> . 
Realizing he had a little time to kill before he needed to beat the ballpark , he went inside . 
" I have , " he says , " a very devout interest in growth . 
" Though he has been in professional baseball for 16 years , and first broke intothe majors 11 years ago , it was only in <DATE>2010</DATE> , his first season with the Mets , that <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> established himself as a solid , dependable , effective big leaguestarting pitcher . 
First , he had to straighten out his life , and crooked-out hispitches.Around the same time he made the switch from conventional pitcher toknuckleballer , he began seeing a psychotherapist , <PERSON>Stephen James</PERSON> , in his nativeNashville - and eventually revealed to him the scars from his past . 
" I hated myself . 
I really did , " <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> says . 
" It was hard to look in he mirror.I was tired of projecting out one person while inside I was somebody totallydifferent . 
And I got to a point of real brokenness with that . 
That 's when I wasintroduced to <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> , and he talked to me about a different way tolive , and I embraced that . 
" When I was presented with a different way to live , it 's almost like I 'd beenwaiting on it my whole life . 
I was 31 , 32 years old when I really got started , when my growth really began for me . 
I 've grown more in the <DATE>last six years than Idid</DATE> my previous 30 . 
" A limited fraternityMeantime , <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> plowed forward with the switch to the knuckleball , first withthe <ORGANIZATION>Rangers</ORGANIZATION> organization - his first and only big league start for them as aknuckleballer , in <DATE>2006</DATE> , was a disaster , as he gave up a record-tying six homeruns - then with the http://stats.washingtonpost.com/mlb/teamreports.asp?tm=12&report=teamhome-URL-Seattle <ORGANIZATION>Mariners</ORGANIZATION> andhttp : / / stats.washingtonpost.com/mlb/teamreports.asp?tm=09&report=teamhome-URL-Minnesota Twins.Former <ORGANIZATION>Rangers</ORGANIZATION> knuckleball ace <PERSON>Charlie Hough</PERSON> worked with him extensively , showing him a new grip and a repeatable delivery , and he later got lessons fromnoted knuckleballers <PERSON>Phil Niekro</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tim Wakefield</PERSON> . 
The small cadre ofknuckleball specialists acted very much as a fraternity . 
" There 's an instant bond because we 're the only ones who have walked a mile ineach other 's shoes , " <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> says . 
" I used what they gave me and infused thepitch with my own personality . 
" <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> 's knuckler is different from others in that it is harder - typically inthe mid - to high-70s , as opposed to the mid - to upper-60s . 
As a result , he isable to keep it in the strike zone with consistency unmatched for aknuckleballer , while still fooling hitters with its flutters . 
" He 's got the rising one , the sinking one , the sideways one - it 's tough tohit , " says <ORGANIZATION>Nationals</ORGANIZATION> slugger http://stats.washingtonpost.com/mlb/playerstats.asp?id=7562-URL-Michael <PERSON>Morse</PERSON> . 
" You see it , and by the time youswing it 's in another spot . 
Squaring up his knuckleball is tough . 
You basicallyhave to go up there and take all your mechanics and everything you 've learned , and throw it out the window , and just kind of go Little League - just swing ashard as you can and hope you make contact . 
" Most of <ORGANIZATION>Dickey</ORGANIZATION> 's rate statistics through his first 11 starts of <DATE>2012</DATE> are runningat career highs - including his walk rate ( 2.1 per nine innings ) and hisstrikeout rate ( 8.6 per nine innings ) - and he is positioned , with anothermonth 's worth of solid performance , to make his first all-star team . 
" That would be nice , " he says . 
" It would be recognition that what you do islegitimate , and just because you throw a knuckleball does n't mean you ca n't bejust as valuable as the 100-mile-per-hour-fastball guy . 
" Everyone thinks the 100-mph-fastball guy has it all over the knuckleball guy , but <PERSON>Dickey</PERSON> knows better.The fastball is n't a living thing ; it 's a rock in a slingshot , a bullet . 
Theydo n't have a relationship ; it 's a one-way street . 
The fastball guy may love hisfastball , but without that shared history , without the trust built up throughunderstanding each other 's needs , it will never love him back.sheinind@washpost.com
