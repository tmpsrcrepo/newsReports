On the final <DATE>weekend</DATE> of a fiercely fought presidential campaign , President Obamaholds a narrow advantage over <PERSON>Mitt Romney</PERSON> in the crucial contest for theelectoral votes needed to win the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> , even as national polls continueto show the candidates in a virtual tie for the popular vote.In <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> , despite record levels of disapproval with the institution , votersseem likely to opt for the status quo - Democrats in charge of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> andRepublicans in the House.Democrats are expected to gain seats in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> but not the 25 needed torecapture the majority lost in the Republican sweep of <DATE>2010</DATE> . 
In the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> , Democrats hold a 53-47 majority , including two independents who caucus withthem . 
Although 10 or more races were considered too close to call through muchof the <DATE>fall</DATE> , Democrats are now in a position to maintain their majority , although perhaps barely.This election assessment , along with reports on all the states , is based oninterviews by a team of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post reporters with strategists in the twoparties and both presidential campaigns , as well as state and local officialsand independent analysts . 
The assessment includes an analysis of polls onindividual states and races that have poured forth over the final weeks beforethe election.In the presidential campaign , the biggest and most consequential unknowns atthis point are the size and shape of the voting population . 
An electorate thatresembles or even slightly exceeds <DATE>2008</DATE> in terms of the share of minority votersvs . 
white voters would clearly benefit <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> . 
A slight decline in the minorityshare of the electorate and a more even split between Democrats and Republicans - closer to the <DATE>2004</DATE> electorate than <DATE>2008</DATE> - would greatly help Romney . 
Obama , however , may do better among white voters in some of the battleground statesthan he will do nationally.The latest <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post-ABC News national poll shows a dead heat thisweekend , with <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> and <PERSON>Romney</PERSON> both at <PERCENT>48 percent</PERCENT> among likely voters . 
Thesurvey has barely fluctuated.Obama spent part of this past week in his official capacity as commander inchief as Hurricane Sandy devastated the <LOCATION>Atlantic Coast</LOCATION> , pummeling <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> andNew York the hardest . 
His attention to the cleanup earned praise from <LOCATION>New JerseyGov</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Chris Christie</PERSON> , a Romney supporter who delivered the keynote address at theRepublican National Convention.Almost half of all Americans said <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's hurricane response would be a factorin their vote , according to the latest Post-ABC tracking poll . 
An earlier surveyfound that <PERCENT>79 percent</PERCENT> rated his handling of the situation excellent or good.Another wild card is whether the latest jobs report will have a demonstrableeffect on an electorate deeply polarized and with few undecided voters left . 
Thereport , released <DATE>Friday</DATE> , showed that 171,000 jobs were added while theunemployment rate ticked up to 7.9 percent.PresidentialThrough much of the fall campaign , nine states have defined the presidentialbattleground : <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and Wisconsin.Obama began the general-election race with a base of 18 states plus theDistrict , totaling 237 electoral votes . 
Romney began with a base of 23 states , totaling 191 electoral votes . 
<LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> is tipping toward <PERSON>Romney</PERSON> and <PERSON>Nevadatoward Obama</PERSON> , putting the president at 243 and <ORGANIZATION>Romney</ORGANIZATION> at 206 . 
Romney is making a late play in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> and will campaign inthe <ORGANIZATION>Keystone State</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> . 
Both states continue to lean toward the president , but <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's campaign has decided to send former president <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> toPennsylvania on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> for extra measure.Assuming those states continue to stay in <LOCATION>Obama</LOCATION> 's column , the president wouldneed only 27 of the remaining 89 electoral votes to win . 
Romney would need 64 ofthe 89 , which explains why <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> still has an easier - but by no means certain - path to an <ORGANIZATION>Electoral College</ORGANIZATION> majority . 
For example , he could win a second termsimply by winning <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> , which remains competitive.If the <ORGANIZATION>Sunshine State</ORGANIZATION> goes for Romney , then much will depend on <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> , which iswhy it is the focus of so much campaign activity in the final days . 
Its 18electoral votes represent the bulwark of <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's Midwestern line of defenseagainst Romney.If the president were to carry <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> - and he continues to hold a narrow lead inpublic polls there - he could win an electoral majority by adding <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> ( 13electoral votes ) or <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> ( 10 ) or <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> ( nine ) , or by winning <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> ( six ) and <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> ( four ) . 
If Romney does not win <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> , his path to victory would have to include <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> and either <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> . 
But if he doescapture the <ORGANIZATION>Buckeye State</ORGANIZATION> , he could become president by taking <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> andVirginia and then just one other contested state.PollThe Post-ABC tracking survey underscored the closeness of the race nationally.During two weeks of polling , the largest lead by either candidate was 50 percentto <PERCENT>47 percent</PERCENT> , favoring Romney . 
<PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's biggest was one point . 
Neither wasstatistically significant.Obama 's job approval rating continues to hold at <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> , with 34 percentsaying they strongly approve and <PERCENT>39 percent</PERCENT> saying they strongly disapprove.Romney holds a statistically insignificant three-point edge on who is trustedmore to handle the economy . 
<PERSON>Obama</PERSON> has a six-point advantage on who betterunderstands Americans ' economic problems.Through most of the campaign and as recently as <DATE>October</DATE> , more voters offeredunfavorable than favorable impressions of Romney . 
Today a majority of likelyvoters has a favorable view . 
In fact , he and <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> are virtually tied on thismeasure : <PERCENT>54 percent</PERCENT> say they have a favorable impression of the president , <PERCENT>while53 percent</PERCENT> say the same of Romney.For the first time in the Post-ABC poll , independent voters are evenly splitbetween the two candidates , at <PERCENT>46 percent</PERCENT> each . 
Until now , <ORGANIZATION>Romney</ORGANIZATION> has held anadvantage ranging from three to 20 points . 
Obama leads among women by sixpoints , Romney among men by seven points.Obama is winning <PERCENT>38 percent</PERCENT> of white voters and <PERCENT>78 percent</PERCENT> of non-whites . 
Hegets <PERCENT>33 percent</PERCENT> of whites without college degrees and <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT> of whites withcollege degrees.CampaignObama 's hopes for a second term rest on his ability to reassemble and motivate acoalition of African Americans , Hispanics , young voters and women , despitedisappointment and diminished enthusiasm since his historic <DATE>2008</DATE> victory.In <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> , he is aided by the success of the auto-industry bailout and thecampaign 's attacks on <ORGANIZATION>Romney</ORGANIZATION> 's business background , which have bolstered thepresident 's support among white working-class voters . 
Beyond that , <PERSON>Romney</PERSON> hasbeen hammered in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> for an ad suggesting that <ORGANIZATION>Chrysler</ORGANIZATION> 's new owners plan toshift production of Jeeps to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , which the chief executive denied.Romney has a motivated base , with Republicans eager to defeat a president theythink is taking the country in the wrong direction . 
But he needs both a turnoutthat is large enough to make the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> share of the electorate almost equal tothat of the Democrats . 
He also needs an edge among independent voters.For the past week , <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's advisers have expressed confidence that the race istheirs to lose and that they will not lose it . 
" The economic debate hascrystallized , " campaign manager <PERSON>Jim Messina</PERSON> said <DATE>Saturday</DATE> . 
" We have picked upsteam and now what we have to do is turn out our vote . 
We continue to lead orare tied in every battleground state and have the ability to get to 270electoral votes in a variety of ways . 
" Romney advisers have said their polls show that the battlegrounds , particularlyOhio , are closer than public surveys suggest . 
They also say that an incumbentwho is not above <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> in the polls in the final days is in a precariousposition . 
" When you take a look at the big three - <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> - we feelvery good , " said <PERSON>Romney</PERSON> senior adviser <PERSON>Russ Schriefer</PERSON> . 
" <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> is tight but it ' stied and I think we 've got some advantages there . 
I think then you look at therest of the map that , in a million years , the <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> campaign never thought theywould be campaigning in these states the weekend before the election . 
" He added : " We 're going to win this thing . 
" SenateDemocrats appear poised to hold on to their narrow <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> majority on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , aprospect that as recently as a year ago seemed far more difficult , given thedisparity in the number of seats Democrats ( 23 ) and Republicans ( 10 ) had todefend.The turning point for Democrats may have been the surprise decision byRepublican Sen. <PERSON>Olympia J. Snowe</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> ) not to seek another term . 
Snowe wasconsidered a shoo-in for reelection but in her absence , former governor AngusKing , an independent who would caucus with Democrats , has emerged as a favorite.Then Republicans made a series of self-inflicted mistakes , two centering on thesubject of rape . 
Indiana Treasurer <PERSON>Richard Mourdock</PERSON> , who ousted longtime Sen.Richard <PERSON>G. Lugar</PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> primary , gave Democratic Rep. <PERSON>Joe Donnelly</PERSON> anopening . 
Then <ORGANIZATION>Mourdock</ORGANIZATION> 's comments at a late <DATE>October</DATE> debate - where he said awoman who becomes pregnant by rape is carrying a " gift from God " and thereforemust have the child - turned the race from a tossup to one that favors Donnelly.In <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> , Rep. <PERSON>Todd Akin</PERSON> won the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nomination and days later made a commentabout " legitimate rape " rarely causing pregnancy that created a nationalfirestorm . 
Much of the party establishment abandoned Akin , but he refused todrop out of the race . 
Sen. <PERSON>Claire McCaskill</PERSON> ( D ) is favored to win reelection.Democrats have growing confidence that former <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> administration officialElizabeth Warren , a <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> law professor , will beat Sen. <PERSON>Scott Brown</PERSON> ( R ) inMassachusetts . 
The contest is the premier <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> race in the country for theseat long held by the late <PERSON>Edward M. Kennedy</PERSON> ( D ) . 
Republicans have a number of opportunities to pick up seats held by retiringDemocrats . 
Races in <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> , where Democrats are retiring , seem likely to fall for Republicans . 
<LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> has a very tight race between twoformer governors : Democrat <PERSON>Timothy M. Kaine</PERSON> and Republican <PERSON>George Allen</PERSON> . 
InMontana , Sen. <PERSON>Jon Tester</PERSON> ( D ) and Rep. <PERSON>Denny Rehberg</PERSON> ( R ) have been tied formonths.Even if several of those races tip to Republicans in the final hours , it stillseems unlikely that the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> will add the four seats it would need to control theSenate if <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> is reelected or the three it would would need if Romney wins.The most likely outcome is no net change , or Republican gains of one or twoseats.HouseIn the battle for control of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> , it has become clear over the past fewmonths that the wave of elections that roiled the chamber in <DATE>2006</DATE> , <DATE>2008</DATE> and 2010will not be repeated <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> . 
Democrats need 25 seats to regain the majority.Not even their most optimistic strategists think that is anything more than aremote possibility.Because of the decennial redistricting process , both parties will score heavygains in certain states . 
Republicans look poised to pick up at least three andmaybe four seats in <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> . 
Democrats could take five seats fromRepublicans in Illinois.After taking control of more governorships and state legislatures in <DATE>2010</DATE> , Republicans had the political muscle to carve up new congressional districts totheir advantage . 
They shored up some of their most vulnerable incumbents anddrew difficult districts for Democrats.The result : Republicans are now likely to gain at least 10 Democratic seatssimply because of the partisanship of redrawn districts , and Democrats arefighting from behind in their effort to win back the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> . 
That is why overallDemocratic gains may be held to the mid-single <PERSON>digits.balzd@washpost.comchris.cillizza@washingtonpost.comAaron Blake</PERSON> , <PERSON>Sean Sullivan</PERSON> , <PERSON>Jon Cohen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Scott Clement</PERSON> contributed to thisreport .
