The Post 's coverage of President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> , <PERSON>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON> , <PERSON>Paula Jones</PERSON> et al. , has prompted questions and complaints from some readers who understandably wishthey could know more about our sources . 
" I 'm sick of this sourceless news , " onereader told our ombudsman.He 's not alone . 
These stories have aggravated an old problem : How can we bestconvey information to readers when our sources absolutely refuse to beidentified?The job of Post journalists is to inform readers on matters of public interestand importance . 
Our goal is to tell people what we find out when we areconfident that the information is accurate . 
We strive to share with readers thesources of our information , but that is not always possible.Why not ? 
Usually , the explanations are quite obvious . 
Consider the story wepublished <DATE>March 5</DATE> about President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> 's deposition in the Paula Jones sexualharassment lawsuit . 
Post reporter <PERSON>Peter Baker</PERSON> got the first detailed , authoritative account of what <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> said in his deposition . 
But the depositionwas sealed and subject to a " gag order " from Judge <PERSON>Susan Webber Wright</PERSON> , thefederal judge in Little Rock who is presiding over <LOCATION>Jones</LOCATION> 's civil lawsuit againstthe president . 
She had ordered all participants in the case not to disclose anyof the evidence introduced in pretrial proceedings . 
To get this story , <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> hadto agree that we would do nothing to disclose how he learned what he learned.We decided to print a long story after establishing to our own absolutesatisfaction that it was a complete and reliable report of the president ' stestimony -- and of how the president reacted at certain moments during thedeposition as well . 
Our story was attributed to " a detailed account " ofClinton 's deposition , an admittedly frustrating and uninformative formulation.This angered some readers , who complained that its sources must have beentendentious , unreliable , unethical or had violated the law by evading JudgeWright 's order . 
Some readers said they doubted The Post even had a source.We remain bound by the " ground rules , " as journalists call them , under whichBaker learned details of <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> 's deposition . 
But it is noteworthy to us thatno one involved in the case raised even a minor question about the story ' saccuracy . 
Other news organizations came up with accounts that confirmed ours.Friday 's release of nearly the entire deposition by <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> 's lawyers now allowsany curious citizen to confirm our story.Yes , this may sound arrogant . 
And yes , we realize that we strain relations withreaders when we ask them , as we did in this case and many others during the pastseven weeks , to trust us and our unidentified sources . 
But we are left in thisposition once we decide that our first obligation to readers is to give them asgood and as timely information as we can . 
And that is our decision , almostalways . 
Informing the reader comes first.This means , as some readers have pointed out to us , that we published <PERSON>Baker</PERSON> ' sstory knowing that the information it contained was subject to Judge <PERSON>Wright</PERSON> ' sorder . 
As a legal matter , such orders do not cover the media , and we and ourlawyers believe that judges in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> can not gag the press , whose freedom isprotected by the First Amendment to the Constitution . 
We expend much of ourenergy on finding information of public interest that others do n't wantpublished in a newspaper : That 's what the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon Papers</ORGANIZATION> case was about . 
Andthere are countless , more mundane examples . 
The District of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> 's policedepartment chronically withholds information we think belongs in the publicdomain ; we are always battling the department to learn things it wants to hidefrom us . 
When we succeed , we publish it . 
We believe readers have a right toknow . 
That is our bias.Some critics , including our own ombudsman , think The Post has changed itstraditional policies , which call for maximum possible identification of sources , at least two sources for confidential information and strong efforts by ourreporters to get sources on the record . 
Those policies have not changed . 
Weadhere to those standards.Each situation that arises has to be dealt with individually . 
For example , whena reporter comes back with an important story based on an authentic , classifiedor confidential document that the reporter has personally read , that 's goodenough for us . 
If we have seen the document , we do n't require a second source.Occasionally , The Post will run a story that seems to be based on a single humansource . 
In its text , you will read only that the information came , for example , from " a source knowledgeable about the situation . " 
This is a frustratingattribution , to be sure . 
But in this media-saturated age , many knowledgeablesources learn how to protect themselves and box us into a corner where we mustchoose between using their information with vague attribution , or not sharing itwith readers at all.In such cases we may have a second and even a third source who has confirmed theinformation " off the record . " 
This means we can not refer to the second or thirdsource in any way . 
But we know what they told us , and if it confirms what weknow from another source , that strengthens our confidence in the accuracy of ourstory . 
On other occasions , we may have seen a confirming document -- but undercircumstances we have agreed not to recount . 
Sometimes we put added trust in asingle source who was a participant in or eyewitness to the events described.Some readers complain that we must be allowing interested parties to color ourcoverage by leaking selective information to us . 
Of course , we can not be certainthis never happens , but we work hard to prevent it . 
No reporter at <ORGANIZATION>The Post</ORGANIZATION> hasbeen handed a juicy story during the Clinton-Jones-Lewinsky episode . 
Our peopleare out daily , piecing together stories that often take many days to report.Yes , some of our sources want to grind axes . 
We recognize that , and treat theirinformation accordingly . 
But we will never print a story that comes from asingle , tendentious source without credible confirmation . 
We do not printunconfirmed stories just because they are juicy , or just to beat ourcompetition.We know we will be held accountable for our accuracy . 
We hope that readers willjudge The Post by its reliability . 
Nothing is more important to us than ourcredibility . 
We realize many readers are infuriated by anonymous sourcing . 
Manyjournalists are , too . 
But we also think our readers should know that sometimesgranting anonymity to sources is the only way to acquire publishable informationon matters of interest and importance to them . 
So , if we have confidence in ourinformation , we will print it.Are the stories of <PERSON>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON> , <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> , <PERSON>Paula Jones</PERSON> et al. , a matterof public interest and importance ? 
We have thought so from the day we publishedthe first Lewinsky story . 
It was based on our discovery that independent counselKenneth <PERSON>Starr</PERSON> had broadened his investigation of the president after hearingtape-recorded conversations in which the former <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> intern had suggestedthat the president and his friend <PERSON>Vernon Jordan</PERSON> might have suborned perjury orobstructed justice.Recent reader reaction has reminded us that we can and should do more todescribe how we work in difficult situations ; hence this article . 
Traditionalnewspaper journalism leaves insufficient room for dialogue between journalistsand their readers . 
We have resolved to do better.Robert <PERSON>Kaiser</PERSON> is managing editor of The <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post.READER REACTION TO THE POST 'S COVERAGEThe following e-mails were edited for publication , with the authors ' permission , from the many sent to The Post 's ombudsman : I 'm disturbed by the lead story today [ <DATE>March 5</DATE> ] about the sealed deposition ofPresident <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> . 
Somebody must have seen the deposition . 
What worries me aboutthe story is that there is [ a ] very passing reference to the sources . 
Everythinghas been leaked and compromised [ so ] that it 's difficult for those of us who tryto be open-minded and try to figure out what 's going on , to know where thingshave come from . 
I thought the deposition was sealed . 
I know it 's news , but whenThe Post does this , they owe the reader an explanation of how they got thisinformation.Margaret <PERSON>Sullivan</PERSON> , AlexandriaOne thing in The Post coverage of President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> 's deposition for the PaulaJones case seriously troubles me . 
The very long and otherwise comprehensiveMarch 5 article fails to mention that The Post 's source , who provided all thedata on which the article was based , is in evident contravention of the judge ' sgag order , and thus behaving illegally . 
The follow-up coverage on <DATE>March</DATE> 6soft-pedaled this matter . 
That is intellectually dishonest.It entices the reader to overlook questions that may reflect on the accuracy ofthe information . 
How complete was the information furnished by the source ( s ) ? 
Was there any slant to the information provided ? 
Was there any significance tothe timing of the information release ? 
What might be the motivations of thesource ( s ) ? 
<PERSON>William Kingsberry</PERSON> , RestonI am curious to see how <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> investigates the flagrant violationof <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON>Susan Webber Wright</PERSON> 's gag order . 
The leaks of the allegedcontents of the president 's deposition in the <LOCATION>Paula Jones</LOCATION> case surely deserveinvestigation . 
Yet how will The Post mount any sort of credible investigationsince The Post is one of the greatest beneficiaries of the leaks ? 
Perhaps ThePost should create a Special Investigative Reporter position to investigatewrongdoing by The Post itself.Douglas <PERSON>Surber</PERSON> , <LOCATION>Orinda</LOCATION> , Calif.How to Reach Our Authors and <DATE>UsBeginning today</DATE> , Outlook will provide more ways for readers to comment on thearticles we publish.Readers can send their comments directly to some of this week 's Outlook authorsat their e-mail addresses : <PERSON>PETER KORNBLUH</PERSON> ( pkorngwu.edu ) JOHN PASSACANTANDO ( cantandoozone.org ) JACK RAVOKE ( rakoveleland.stanford.edu ) <PERSON>DEBORAH TANNEN</PERSON> ( robinsdagunet.georgetown.edu ) PAT WELSH ( carwelerols.com ) Because some of our authors do not have e-mail accounts , Outlook would be gladto forward any comments addressed to the other authors c/o Outlook .
