Norwegian director <PERSON>Hans Petter Moland</PERSON> 's " Aberdeen " takes a well-worn road -- the route to reconciliation between parent and child -- and makes it fresh , thanks to corrosively watchable performances by <ORGANIZATION>Stellan Skarsgard</ORGANIZATION> and LenaHeadey as an alcoholic father and his estranged , cokehead daughter . 
Oh , thereare sentimental potholes that line this path ( some of them laid there by thefilmmaker himself ) , but <PERSON>Moland</PERSON> 's cold and clear-eyed film ultimately swerves toavoid them all , always choosing delicious ambiguity over the easy out . 
GiftedScottish actress <PERSON>Headey</PERSON> plays <PERSON>Kaisa</PERSON> , a successful but unhappy lawyer in a Londonfirm conscripted into service by her dying mother ( <ORGANIZATION>Charlotte Rampling</ORGANIZATION> in toosmall a part ) to dragoon <PERSON>Kaisa</PERSON> 's stinking-drunk father , <PERSON>Tomas</PERSON> ( <ORGANIZATION>Skarsgard</ORGANIZATION> , in ablistering tour de force ) , from <LOCATION>Norway</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> for a family reunion of sortsbefore mom expires . 
Along the way , <PERSON>Tomas</PERSON> embarrasses and insults Kaisa innumerous ways.Vomiting on her and stealing from her are only the most flagrant . 
Hers is aliteral burden , no less cumbersome than a 200-pound sack of urine - andbooze-soaked potatoes . 
Into the mix comes a kindhearted trucker named <PERSON>Clive</PERSON> ( IanHart , ever charming in his homuncular way ) , who gives a lift in more ways thanone to <PERSON>Kaisa</PERSON> and her perpetually inebriated human baggage , while avoidingbecoming the knight in shining armor we 're used to . 
" Aberdeen " has the feel ofthe morning after . 
It minces neither words nor emotions , and its conclusion , which no one could call happy , smacks more of detente brought on by fatigue thanclosure . 
Contains obscenity , alcohol and drug abuse , an auto accident , a streetmugging , sex and nudity .

-- <PERSON>Michael O'SullivanWhat</PERSON> is most shocking about this difficult and flawed feature debut fromfilmmaker <PERSON>Michael Cuesta</PERSON> is not its controversial NC-17 rating or the subjectmatter of pedophilia . 
It is the fact that <PERSON>Cuesta</PERSON> , who co-wrote the film withStephen M. Ryder and brother <PERSON>Gerald Cuesta</PERSON> , manages to make its most difficultcharacter , a creepy guy in his fifties who seduces underage boys in amiddle-class <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> community , sympathetic -- even heroic . 
But that ' smainly because of a nuanced performance by <PERSON>Brian Cox</PERSON> as Big <PERSON>John Harrigan</PERSON> . 
In arole that challenges our very notion of morality , Cox comes across as bothpredatory and fatherly , sometimes at once , in an acting turn as astonishing asit is stomach-turning . 
" L.I.E. " is really his story , despite the fact that thefilm unfolds from the point of view of 15-year-old Howie ( <PERSON>Paul Franklin Dano</PERSON> ) , an affluent and sexually ambiguous punk with a gift for poetry . 
After <PERSON>Howie</PERSON> andhis friend <PERSON>Gary</PERSON> ( <PERSON>Billy Kay</PERSON> ) break into Big <PERSON>John</PERSON> 's home and steal a pair ofantique guns , <ORGANIZATION>Big John</ORGANIZATION> , an ex-Marine who has been buying sex from <PERSON>Gary</PERSON> , tracksHowie down . 
Their relationship , which veers from hunter and hunted to adisturbing fusion of the erotic and the avuncular , is the film 's most compellingelement . 
As <PERSON>Howie</PERSON> , whose mother has recently died in a car accident on the <ORGANIZATION>LongIsland Expressway</ORGANIZATION> ( hence the punning title ) and whose crooked contractor fatheris about to be busted by the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> , falls under Big <PERSON>John</PERSON> 's spell , <ORGANIZATION>Big John</ORGANIZATION> becomesmore surrogate caregiver than sugar daddy . 
Dramatically , though , Cuesta paintshimself into a corner . 
He ca n't bring himself to fully redeem Big <PERSON>John</PERSON> , so heresorts to a cop-out ending whose cheesily punitive dose of poetic justice canbe seen barreling down on us like an 18-wheeler . 
Contains obscenity , a shooting , hooliganism and the overarching theme of pedophilia .
