As <PERSON>Suzanne Satter</PERSON> huddled with her co-workers at an engineering firm on <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> and watched the catastrophe unfold on TV , she was overwhelmed to see peoplejumping from the flaming World Trade Center -- and she noticed that some wereholding hands . 
" It made me think : Whom would I jump with ? " 
said Satter.She looked around at her colleagues , about 15 people in her section , allsquished into separate cubicles . 
" You do n't think the people you work with arethe ones you will die with , " she said . 
" It made me think about whom I wasworking with . 
It made me think about the work I was doing . 
" Whom would you jump with ? 
This is the new metaphor of how people look at theirjobs . 
The image acknowledges the fragility of life and the fact that it couldend in the workplace . 
That leads to some basic questions : How meaningful is yourwork ? 
Is it where you want to spend most of your waking hours?The terrorist attacks struck at the heart of the American workplace . 
The carnagetook mostly workers who were building careers and raising families -- unifyingan age group in a single day the way that a war defines a generation.In office buildings and factories across the country , workers could easilyidentify with those in the World Trade Center and the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> , with those onthe hijacked planes and in the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> Fire Department . 
So many were just doingtheir jobs , paying the mortgage , playing with the kids on weekends . 
Some weremaking it big . 
Others were just glad to get a paycheck.What comes out of the wreckage is the realization of just how intense , importantand intimate the workplace is -- for better and worse.Suzanne <PERSON>Satter</PERSON> is lucky . 
She loves her work as an environmental scientist . 
Shesays her colleagues are " a terrific group of people . " 
In the next cubicle is ayoung guy , married , with a toddler . 
They are good buddies . 
As the buzz goesaround the office about whom to jump with , she is pleased when he says : " <PERSON>Suzanne</PERSON> , I would jump out with you ! 
" This , of course , is something of a joke since they work in a " ground-scraper " inDenver and their offices are less than two stories from street level . 
But suchtalk relieves the tension while acknowledging the new presence of fear in theworkplace . 
It also underscores the importance of " colleagueship . " 
The jumpingpledge is an affirmation of mutual warmth and support and it reflects thepotential richness and security of on-the-job friendships.The attacks have also led many people to reexamine their working environment : Ismy workplace safe ? 
How is my boss responding to the continued threats ofviolence?Certainly the threat of violence and exploitation has always been present in theworkplace . 
But <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> has readjusted upward the personal calculation ofoverall risk . 
It 's one thing to think you 'd like to take this job and shove it -- quite another to think that you are putting your family and yourself indanger . 
" People are assessing their vulnerability . 
They are assessing their priorities , " said psychologist <PERSON>Kathleen V. Shea</PERSON> , a management consultant in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> . 
" There ' sthe general feeling of being unsafe . 
That is the real terror of any overpoweringact -- a rape or assault . 
Now we have it on a massive scale , " she said . 
" People were going down a road and the white line disappeared . 
There 's a lot ofchaos , " said social worker <PERSON>Peter Crockett</PERSON> , who counsels workers in <LOCATION>Washingtonarea</LOCATION> employee-assistance programs . 
" Most people are taking stock : ' Is this whatI want to do with the rest of my life ? ' " 
he continued . 
" Then the layoffsstarted and the choice was taken out of their hands . 
" <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> has made job safety and job security top priorities for Americanworkers and their employers . 
In <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , some offices have becomemini-battlegrounds with bomb scares and fire alarms and contaminated mail.People are preoccupied with physical safety . 
If the " big one " were to hit theoffice , is there an evacuation plan ? 
" How do you leave a 16-story buildingquickly ? " 
explained <PERSON>Crockett</PERSON> . 
" Where do you go ? 
How do you find your husband oryour wife , and your children ? " 
With each alarm , the background level of anxietyintensifies . 
For many people , that triggers a great deal of personal stress . 
" We had a fire alarm at work , " wrote a reader who works at the <ORGANIZATION>NationalEndowment</ORGANIZATION> for the Arts . 
" I , the together , organized , multi-tasking , tough bigsister , thought I was going to lose it in the stairwell and almost began cryingwhen I got outside . 
" As the weeks of alert stretch out , other people use denial as a protectivestrategy . 
They cope with the chronic state of alert in the workplace by makinglight of new security measures such as stricter requirements to enter abuilding . 
That way the risks seem smaller and more manageable.But this approach does n't work for those who find that tightened security makesthem feel more secure . 
When colleagues joke about having to show their identitycards or open their mail with gloves , they feel isolated , angry and moreanxious . 
" I find it very difficult to come to an office where everyone finds itincredibly funny that so many precautions are being taken to secure ourwell-being , " said a woman who works in a consulting firm in the <LOCATION>District</LOCATION> . 
Shewas frightened every time she heard a siren and upset that her colleagues did n'tseem to take the threats seriously . 
" From the office manager to the secretary , they feel it is a terrible impositionthat we now have to use our access card to get in the building , " she wrote me inan e-mail . 
" I hear them cackling outside my office . " 
She now finds her workenvironment is " pure harassment . 
" The workplace atmosphere has become increasingly important . 
Whom would you jumpwith ? 
If you look around the office and do n't see any candidates , it may be asignal that you are in the wrong job . 
Some workers say they are less ready toput up with on-the-job hassle and pettiness after <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> . 
Others come to a decision to change jobs . 
Usually they have been mulling overthis idea for some time . 
The terror attacks crystallized their thinking . 
" I am very unfulfilled , " said <PERSON>Deen Howard</PERSON> , an administrative assistant at amedical association in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> . 
" It 's time to move on . 
There 's no opportunityfor advancement . 
I 'm lucky I have a job , but I would like something better . " 
Shesays she wants to go to medical school . 
" I said to myself : Now is the time notto waste any more time . 
Do it now . 
Just do it . 
" Psychologist <PERSON>Shea</PERSON> put it this way : " People are using the good dishes every day.They are not saving them for the holidays . . . . They are not postponing thosedreams anymore . 
They 're living them . 
There 's a sense of now , more than ever . 
" There is also a sense of siege . 
While some people are contemplating a jobchange , many others are simply losing their jobs . 
Since <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> , the hardesthit have been the lowest-paid workers in the service industries . 
In <DATE>October</DATE> , nearly 440,000 jobs in the private sector were lost.For many people , the initial trauma of the terror attacks has been exacerbatedby job loss , raising the stress bar even higher . 
In one theory of stress afterdisasters , researchers focus on the cycle of losses and gains as a gauge to howwell people will survive . 
After the initial trauma of <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> , for example , Americans turned to their personal inventory of emotional , social and financialresources . 
" Love is a resource , " explained <PERSON>Steven Hobfall</PERSON> , director of theapplied psychology center at <ORGANIZATION>Kent State University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Your job is a resource.The <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> assault was an acute trauma . 
The wave of job loss is a chronictrauma .
