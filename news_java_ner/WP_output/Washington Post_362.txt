IT 'S <DATE>FEBRUARY 15 , 2000</DATE> , a pivotal moment in the race for the Republicannomination for president , and at the televised candidates ' debate in <LOCATION>Columbia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION> , temperatures are rising.John <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> , fresh off an upset victory in the <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> primary , has runinto a buzz saw of negative advertising about his record and rumor-mongeringabout his personal life , and he blames his main opponent , <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON> . 
" You should be ashamed , " a tight-lipped <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> scolds Bush.Bush has his own beef : <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's ads have likened <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's character to that ofBill <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> . 
" You can disagree with me on issues , <PERSON>John</PERSON> , but do not question -- do not question my trustworthiness . " " 
. . . You 're putting out stuff that is unbelievable , <PERSON>George</PERSON> , and it 's got tostop , " <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> retorts . " 
. . . This is probably the nastiest campaign that peoplehave seen in a long time . " " 
. . . Listen , you 're playing the victim here , " <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> shoots back . 
" Wait aminute , remember who called who untrustworthy . 
" Six years later , <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> is president and <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> is preparing for another run forthe <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> . 
He 's in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> on a <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> at the start of a longweekend of raising money for local Republican candidates and laying thegroundwork for <DATE>2008</DATE> . 
And everywhere he goes , he 's got only good things to sayabout <PERSON>George W. Bush.He</PERSON> praises <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's steadfastness on the war in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> and says he 's especiallyproud of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's support for the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> 's immigration bill . 
" I think thepresident has shown a lot of courage on this issue , " he tells a crowd ofactivists at <ORGANIZATION>Kent County GOP</ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION>Grand Rapids</LOCATION> , many of whom seem alot less certain on the matter.So , what 's changed since <DATE>2000</DATE> ? 
someone in the audience asks <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> . 
" My personality has improved significantly , " quips the senator from <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> . 
" Itook a <ORGANIZATION>Dale Carnegie</ORGANIZATION> course . 
" Then , more seriously : " I think it 's very clear that then-Gov . 
<PERSON>Bush</PERSON> had thesupport of the Republican establishment . 
He worked hard for it , and he gainedit , and he deserved it . " 
Leaving little doubt that <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> would like toaccomplish the same thing himself this time around.He 's no longer offering himself as the alternative to <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> . 
Now he 's positionedhimself as <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's heir , a turnaround that makes some people , including McCainsometimes , more than a little uncomfortable.Such is the case when <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> pays a visit to " The Daily Show With <PERSON>Jon Stewart</PERSON> " afew weeks later . 
McCain 's almost a regular here , and <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> usually treats himlike he 's <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> without the whiskers and the stovepipe hat . 
<PERSON>Buttonight Stewart</PERSON> badgers <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> about <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's claim that he has made the world asafer place . 
" My question to you is simply this : How much safer can the worldafford to have him make us ? 
" <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> rolls his eyes . 
He makes a joke about calling in his lawyers . 
He hems andhaws to the point where <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> pleads , " Do n't dodge the question ! " 
But McCaincontinues to do exactly that . 
Finally , <PERSON>Stewart</PERSON> relents . 
" We 're gon na come backand talk about other things , " he says at the break . 
" Thank God , " says McCain.DON ' T LOOK NOW , but 26 months before <DATE>November 2008</DATE> the race for president hasalready started . 
<PERSON>McCain</PERSON> and his potential rivals are out on the campaign trailvirtually every week . 
They are raising money and support for federal and statecandidates in the <DATE>2006</DATE> election . 
But they are also collecting chits , buildingname recognition and garnering backers for the presidential campaign to come . 
" Teddy White must be turning over in his grave , " says <PERSON>John Weaver</PERSON> , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> ' schief campaign strategist , referring to the late author of The Making of thePresident books . 
" I ca n't believe we 're doing this so early . 
" But doing it they are . 
And no one more assiduously , nor with more apparentsuccess , than <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> , who has vaulted to the front of the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> field . 
Early pollsindicate he gets twice as much support as any other likely Republican candidateexcept <PERSON>Rudy Giuliani</PERSON> , the former mayor of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> , who runs close behind.Even in liberal , blue-state strongholds such as <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> runs evenwith or better than the two most recognizable Democratic names , <PERSON>Hillary Clintonand Al Gore</PERSON> . 
As a former <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> pilot who was shot down over <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> and spent morethan five years as a prisoner of war , he 's got impeccable military credentialsand stature , and a reputation for bipartisanship and fierce independence thatappeals to a broad spectrum of voters . 
He 's also got star power : Turn on yourtelevision most days , and you 'll find <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> on one of the morning talkfests oron " Larry King Live , " " Imus " or " Hannity and <ORGANIZATION>Colmes</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Many of the Republican professionals who once wrote off <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> as the loosest ofpolitical cannons say they are surprised and impressed at the careful , disciplined way he and his staff have gone about establishing his as yetundeclared candidacy . 
He is laboring hard to become the presumptive candidatefor a party that almost always nominates the presumptive candidate . 
" He 's very much where <PERSON>George W. Bush</PERSON> was in <DATE>1998</DATE> and '99 -- getting his teamestablished , trying to create that same air of inevitability that <PERSON>Karl Rovetried</PERSON> to create around <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> , " says <PERSON>Saul Anuzis</PERSON> , chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Michigan ' sRepublican Party</ORGANIZATION> , referring to <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's political Rasputin.Still , there are many rivers to cross before <DATE>November 2008</DATE> . 
McCain has tovanquish a formidable cast of possible Republican opponents , which could includeSens . 
<PERSON>George Allen</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> ) , <PERSON>Sam Brownback</PERSON> ( Kan. ) , <PERSON>Bill Frist</PERSON> ( Tenn. ) and ChuckHagel ( <LOCATION>Neb.</LOCATION> ) , along with <PERSON>Newt Gingrich</PERSON> , <PERSON>Giuliani</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>Massachusetts Gov. MittRomney</ORGANIZATION> . 
He also faces a host of enemies among Republican interest groups andsocial conservatives who have not forgiven or forgotten his run as aniconoclastic insurgent in <DATE>2000</DATE> and who dislike some of the positions hecurrently holds on litmus-test issues such as the gay marriage amendment ( he ' sagainst it ) and stem cell research ( he 's for it ) . 
To succeed , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> must perform the old political two-step : Capture conservativeRepublican loyalists who dominate the party 's nominating process ; then , oncenominated , swing back to the center to attract independents and moderateDemocrats . 
It 's an especially tricky task for a politician who has always casthimself as a man of unvarnished principles and straight talk.McCain concedes he 's being more careful with his rhetoric and off-the-cuffcomments . 
Which is why he looked so uncomfortable with <PERSON>Jon Stewart</PERSON> : " I do n'twant to say anything that I 'm going to be hearing about for the next couple ofyears . 
" Otherwise , he insists , nothing 's changed -- except perhaps the perceptions ofsome analysts . 
" Some on the liberal side say , ' Ah , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's not the maverickthat we thought he was . 
Oh my God , he supports the war in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> ! 
How could he ! 
' And some of my friends on the right say , ' Well , he voted against the marriageamendment , ' " which would ban gay marriage.In many ways , he 's still the same sly , sardonic and self-deprecatory candidatewho charmed the press and a surprisingly large segment of the public in <DATE>2000</DATE> , the quixotic reformer whom political columnist <PERSON>Joe Klein</PERSON> described as " a man ona white horse attempting to traverse a muddy field . 
" But he 's more guarded , more deferential to <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and all the president 's men , more inclined to emphasize his old-fashioned conservative credentials and todownplay those progressive ones . 
There are fewer confessional moments and evenfewer incendiary ones . 
The man who says his favorite president is theroughriding <PERSON>Theodore Roosevelt</PERSON> sounds more like another military man who becamepresident , the cautious elder statesman <PERSON>Dwight Eisenhower.Even</PERSON> so , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> still revels in the spotlight and the sheer giddiness of publiclife . 
" The next day after ' The Daily Show , ' I walked into the building and , I ' mnot exaggerating , 100 interns told me , ' I saw you on <PERSON>Jon Stewart</PERSON> ! ' 
" You got ta walk the tightrope , " he says . 
" Life 's too short to do it anydifferent . 
" HE BOUNDS UP THE STEPS of the small Beechjet 400A and pours himself into aleather seat . 
" This is gon na be a fun trip , " he declares as the plane preparesto take off for the <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> trip . 
He launches into an analysis of Michiganpolitics , sprinkled with conversational detours to <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> , anew book he 's reading on the <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> war and the trials and tribulations of theArizona Diamondbacks.McCain turns 70 on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , and his thinning hair is snowy white . 
The angularbaby face of his Vietnam-era photos is now a full moon with a smooth , doughychin the color of <ORGANIZATION>Pillsbury</ORGANIZATION> flour . 
Two angry red scars plunge down the left sideof his cheek in front of his ear , mementos of melanoma surgery in <DATE>2000</DATE> . 
Whilethey are striking , they seem to fit the biography and the aura . 
It 's easy toimagine that they were inflicted by his North Vietnamese captors , not by acancer surgeon.His shoulders are stiff , and he takes aspirin for the pain . 
He boasts that he ' sbeen written up in orthopedic medical journals because his arms , broken when heejected from his crippled fighter jet over <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> in <DATE>1967</DATE> , were left to heal ontheir own without proper treatment , making him something of a medicalphenomenon.He leaves on his crisp blue blazer even in the privacy of the small plane , andhe does n't loosen his tie . 
Later , when it 's finally time for the coat to comeoff , he turns to <PERSON>Weaver</PERSON> , who gently pulls the jacket from his shoulders . 
" Easy , <PERSON>Johnny</PERSON> , " <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> hums softly . 
" Easy does it . 
" The schedule can be grueling , but <PERSON>Weaver</PERSON> tries to ensure that , except whenMcCain does the morning talk shows , the senator does n't have to rise too earlyor stay up too late . 
Still , like any canny road warrior , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> knows to catch aquick bite to eat or a few minutes ' sleep whenever the opportunity arises . 
Onthis flight , he goes from full-bore conversation to a wispy snore withinminutes , his eyes concealed behind a pair of opaque , wraparound Ray-Bans . 
Buteven when napping he does n't seem to miss much.So how long have you two been traveling together ? 
I ask <PERSON>Weaver</PERSON> after McCainappears to have dozed off . 
" Too long , " a suddenly wide awake <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> interjects with a crooked grin . 
" Muchtoo long . 
" <PERSON>WEAVER</PERSON> , 45 , is a lanky , laconic campaign veteran who first joined <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> in 1998after working for candidates in his native <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> . 
He says he loved the loose , improvised nature of the <DATE>2000</DATE> presidential run , yet always feared it was doomed . 
" Crusades are easier than structured campaigns , " he says . 
" You have lessresponsibility and more freedom . 
But you always lose in the end . 
" When <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> began organizing his <DATE>2000</DATE> race , he had <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> name recognitionand virtually no treasury . 
People vaguely knew his biography -- that hisfather and grandfather were <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> admirals and that he himself was a <LOCATION>Vietnam Warhero</LOCATION> . 
He had come home from a <LOCATION>Hanoi</LOCATION> prison to a hero 's welcome in <DATE>1973</DATE> andlanded a job as the <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> 's liaison officer to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> , where he studiednational security policy at the foot of masters such as Sens. Scoop <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> andJohn Tower . 
He also divorced his first wife , <PERSON>Carol</PERSON> -- in one of his many actsof self-confession , he has admitted he was unfaithful -- and married CindyHensley , whose politically well-connected father owned <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> 's largest beerdistributorship . 
McCain moved there to seek political office . 
He won acongressional seat in <DATE>1982</DATE> , then was elected to <PERSON>Barry Goldwater</PERSON> 's <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seat in1986 when the conservative icon retired.His political career was nearly derailed by scandal a few years later . 
McCainwas the sole Republican among the " Keating Five " -- senators accused ofintervening with federal regulators on behalf of <PERSON>Charles Keating</PERSON> , an Arizonasavings-and-loan magnate whose financial failure in the late <DATE>1980s</DATE> costtax-payers <MONEY>$ 2 billion</MONEY> . 
McCain was cleared of wrongdoing by a Senateinvestigation , but he was deemed to have used " poor judgment . " 
He calls hisinvolvement with <PERSON>Keating</PERSON> " the worst mistake of my life . " 
Afterward , he emergedas the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> 's most ardent champion of campaign finance reform.McCain says he did n't really think about running for president until he ' dfinished campaigning for his friend and <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON>Bob Dole</PERSON> in <DATE>1996</DATE> . 
He says hesimply believed his military and political experience made him the best-equippedcandidate to restore <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's confidence in its public institutions.By <DATE>1998</DATE> , he was ready . 
Besides <PERSON>Weaver</PERSON> , he hired another veteran Republicanoperator , <PERSON>Rick Davis</PERSON> , to be his campaign manager . 
Both men had had run-ins withKarl Rove and the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> political machine , and each was intrigued by thechallenge of going up against it . 
McCain 's campaign had only one asset : aspirited , experienced candidate with a large store of foreign policy expertiseand the ability to think fast on his feet . 
" Every presidential campaign has to be designed around the candidate , " saysDavis . 
" You can run for dogcatcher , and nobody will ever know who you reallyare . 
You run for president , and you are stripped bare . 
Those klieg lights are sobright . 
So we just built it around <PERSON>John</PERSON> , who he was , what he was . 
" To underline who he was , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> and his longtime chief aide , <PERSON>Mark Salter</PERSON> , wroteFaith of My Fathers , a stirring yet self-deprecatory account of his life andtimes that emphasized the <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> family tradition of military service andpatriotic sacrifice . 
Most campaign biography books die a quick death . 
Faith ofMy Fathers , which appeared in <DATE>1999</DATE> , was a bestseller.With little money to buy ads , <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> , <PERSON>Weaver</PERSON> and company concentrated instead onearning their ebullient candidate lots of free coverage in newspapers , magazinesand on television . 
" We knew that <PERSON>John</PERSON> could carry on a conversation with anyreporter for 24 hours a day , " says <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> . 
" So we based our whole campaign modelon ' earned media . ' 
If a reporter wanted to fly with him or get an interview , we 'd say : ' He 's going to the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> . 
You can sit next to him on the plane ; you can have the hotel room next to his ; you can be in the car with him theentire time . ' 
" The same strategy produced the campaign bus , dubbed " Straight Talk Express , " inwhich <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> , positioned in a red leather swivel chair like a prime minister , held a running all-day news conference for the media pack . 
All of it was on therecord , much of it lively and self-lacerating . 
" This was not the model of choice , " says <PERSON>Weaver</PERSON> . 
" It was the necessity model . 
" There were times when the unexpurgated <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> drove the staff crazy . 
Weaverrecalls early on in <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> when a textile worker at a town hall meetingexpressed concern that his children would n't be able to work at the local millbecause foreign companies were taking away jobs . 
" John told the man frankly thathe hoped he had a higher ambition for his children than to be textile workers.Salter and I just got up and left the room shaking our heads " at the bluntness.When <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> beat <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in <LOCATION>New Hampshire</LOCATION> by 19 percentage points , the <ORGANIZATION>StraightTalk Express</ORGANIZATION> became the hottest ticket in mediadom . 
Television news anchors andmedia executives vied with working journalists for seats . 
McCain 's staff had toorganize lists of reservations like the maitre d' at L'Escargot . 
The wheels came off in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> . 
The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> machine and its legions pouredmillions into the campaign there . 
Anonymous fliers claimed <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> had fatheredan illegitimate black child with a prostitute , that he was mentally unstablebecause of his POW experience and that his wife , <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> , was a drug addict ( sheacknowledged she had become addicted to painkillers for a time after backsurgery ) . 
Republican interest groups , angered by <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's championing ofcampaign finance reform , targeted him as well . 
" What happened in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> was as bad as people say , and then some , " recalls Sen. <PERSON>Lindsey Graham</PERSON> , a Republican from the state and one of <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> ' sbest friends in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Every group in the country who makes money offpolitics declared war on <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON> . 
" After his defeat , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> journeyed to <LOCATION>Virginia Beach</LOCATION> , home of televangelist PatRobertson , one of his right-wing critics , and denounced <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> and fellowChristian conservative <PERSON>Jerry Falwell</PERSON> as " agents of intolerance . " 
Riffing toreporters on the bus the next morning , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> joked about battling " the forcesof evil . " 
It was the supreme moment of <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's insurgency : the maverick whiteknight tilting at the legions of religious bigotry . 
Many left-leaningcommentators applauded his audacity . 
But Republican voters were less enthralled.McCain defeated <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> . 
But social conservatives andmainstream Republicans handed him defeats in the Super <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> primaries in nineof 13 states , including <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and Ohio.The insurgency was over . 
" YOU LEARN , " SAYS <PERSON>MCCAIN</PERSON> , recalling the bitter lesson of his <DATE>2000</DATE> defeat . 
" Youreally do learn . " 
He 's sitting in his senatorial office on a quiet afternoon , his black loafers leveraged against the coffee table , contemplating hisevolution from caped crusader to putative front-runner . 
" One of the things thathappened in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> is that I became angry , and I let my anger show . 
Itgot me off message , got me kind of off stride . 
And people do n't like that . 
Whatthey care about is what you 're gon na do for them as president of the UnitedStates . 
" At first , he seemed crushed . 
He told friends he would never run again . 
Cindydragged him off to <LOCATION>Tahiti</LOCATION> for an enforced break . 
" It felt wonderful to wallow inself-pity for 10 days , " he recalls . 
" But that was enough . 
" Upon his return , he was surprised to discover that rather than condemning him tooblivion , the defeat had enhanced his national stature and name recognition . 
Heincreasingly became the go-to senator for television commentators on foreignaffairs and military policy . 
After the 9/11 attacks , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> seemed to pop upeven more often on news shows , offering words of comfort and determination . 
Hebecame so popular with independents and many Democrats that Democratic nomineeJohn <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> tried to persuade him in <DATE>2004</DATE> to become his vice presidential runningmate.His relationship with <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has been a work in progress . 
Both sides say themutual hostility of the <DATE>2000</DATE> campaign began to dissipate after <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> and Bushmet in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> later that <DATE>spring</DATE> and agreed to work together . 
McCaindutifully campaigned for <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> and other Republican candidates . 
" The relationshiphas grown warmer over time , " says <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> . 
" We get along very well . 
" The strategists have followed the lead of their bosses : <PERSON>Weaver</PERSON> says he and Rovesat down for coffee in <DATE>2004</DATE> and put aside their differences . 
McCain 's camp hasalready signed at least two of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's former operatives for the battle to come . 
" You 're dealing with people who are professionals , " says a senior Republicanofficial with close ties to the president . 
" Everybody in <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> world understandsthe most important legacy this president will leave is in dealing with the waron terror with moral clarity . 
And there 's been no more steadfast and articulateproponent of that central policy goal than <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON> . 
" <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> himself notes that there are several areas in which he continues todisagree with <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> , but even there he tends to make allowances . 
Last year hepushed through an amendment explicitly banning torture of terrorist suspectsthat <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> opposed . 
Bush signed the bill but issued a " signing statement " leavinghim the option of waiving the ban when national security is at stake . 
McCainsays he 's not troubled by the statement because <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> has personally assured himhe will enforce the law.Recently <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> was among seven Republican senators who voted against aconstitutional amendment banning gay marriage and was among 19 who voted forfederal funding for embryonic stem cell research , both of which put him at oddswith the president . 
He frequently chides the administration for poor planningand execution of the war in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> . 
But on the campaign trail <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> takes painsto pay homage to the president 's " courage and commitment " in staying the courseboth on the war and on supporting immigration reform.His staff insists these statements are not the result of political calculation.In fact , just the opposite : At a time many Republicans are distancing themselvesfrom the politically wounded president , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> is embracing him . 
" I feel more comfortable disagreeing with the president when his numbers are upthan when they 're down , " he says . 
" It 's just my nature to not want to pile on . 
" Still , the detente has paid early dividends for McCain in important battlegroundstates . 
<PERSON>Ana Navarro</PERSON> , a Republican activist in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> , says big-time donors loyalto the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> family are signing up to contribute to <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> . 
<PERSON>Ronald Weiser</PERSON> , aMichigan real estate developer who was <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's state finance chairman in <DATE>2000</DATE> , told me he 's now backing <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> . 
Even <PERSON>Sam</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charles Wyly</PERSON> , two Texasbusinessmen and longtime <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> supporters who funded <MONEY>$ 2 million</MONEY> in attack adsagainst <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> in <DATE>2000</DATE> , have given <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's political action committee <MONEY>$ 20,000</MONEY> ( the <ORGANIZATION>PAC</ORGANIZATION> announced recently it was returning the donation because the brothersreportedly are under investigation for possible tax infractions ) . 
" We did n't go to the Wyly brothers ; they came to us , " says campaign managerDavis . 
So did many others in the fundraising community . 
" They see <PERSON>John</PERSON> as awinner , and that 's where they want to place their bets . 
" <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> says he started thinking about running for president again on the dayafter the <DATE>November 2004</DATE> election . 
Then <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> heated up while the domesticcenterpiece of <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's second term , Social Security reform , died in congressionalcommittee . 
As <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> 's poll ratings plunged , the political class and itschroniclers in the media started focusing on the race to come -- and on McCainas the one man who could preserve the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> for Republicans . 
" All of asudden we were drinking from a fire hose , and it has n't stopped , " says <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> . 
" Nobody sat around and wrote out a strategy . 
It just happened . 
" <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> has already raised <MONEY>$ 6 million</MONEY> and donated <MONEY>$ 1.2 million</MONEY> to Republicancandidates , says <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> , twice as much as any other Republican . 
Staff membersknow they wo n't be working on a shoestring in <DATE>2008</DATE> . 
" We 'll be in good shape , " says <PERSON>Weaver</PERSON> . 
" We 'll have a 50-state structure by earlynext year , as opposed to a three-state structure last time . 
The house will beready . 
Hopefully , we 'll have an occupant . 
" THIS PAST MAY , the potential occupant was in <LOCATION>Lynchburg</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> , attempting somemajor repairs . 
McCain came here to give the commencement address at LibertyUniversity at the invitation of its founder and president , <PERSON>Falwell</PERSON> , his formerantagonist . 
Dozens of reporters and camera crews made the journey fromWashington to record the cessation of hostilities between a leader of theChristian right and one of its most visible critics . 
Both men smiled for thecameras , and <PERSON>Falwell</PERSON> told everyone who asked that he believed <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> was one ofseveral intriguing prospective presidential candidates whom he could support in2008 . 
Neither made any reference to the <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> primary or <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's " agents of intolerance " speech.McCain did four university commencement speeches this past season . 
At each hegave the same talk , emphasizing civility and pleading for Americans to recognizeone another 's essential goodwill even as they carry on a spirited debate ondivisive gut-wrenching issues such as the war in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> . 
At Liberty , the speechwent down easy , garnering polite applause from graduating seniors and theirparents . 
But on a grassy ridge just beyond the campus , a small band of studentsgathered to protest <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's appearance.Being members of the right-wing Young Americans for Freedom , the protesters wereneatly dressed and painfully polite . 
They were also extremely fed up withMcCain . 
On every issue they ticked off -- immigration , campaign financereform , the gay marriage amendment -- <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> was on the wrong side . 
" Onimmigration , he 's the symbol of the amnesty movement ; he 's spoken outconsistently against Christians , comparing us to <PERSON>Louis Farrakahn</PERSON> ; and he votedagainst the marriage amendment , " said <PERSON>Nathan Rager</PERSON> , 20 , a political sciencemajor . 
McCain could talk all day long about civilized discourse andreconciliation ; <PERSON>Rager</PERSON> and his friends were n't buying.Neither are many other movement conservatives . 
<PERSON>Grover Norquist</PERSON> , head ofAmericans for Tax Reform and a longtime <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> antagonist , has accused him offlip-flopping on gun control and taxes . 
<PERSON>Lou Sheldon</PERSON> , founder of the <ORGANIZATION>TraditionalValues Coalition</ORGANIZATION> , has said <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> is not a loyal Republican . 
Rush Limbaugh hasdenounced him as a " RINO -- Republican in Name Only . 
" <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> concedes that some Christian conservatives will never accept him . 
Butthere are others who appreciate his antiabortion voting record , his support forIsrael , his loyalty to the president and even his support for legislationcombating climate change , which has become an important issue for someevangelicals . 
When I ask him about <PERSON>Falwell</PERSON> , he pulls out a photo the rotundreverend inscribed for him at the Liberty commencement . 
It reads : " You are agreat American , a national treasure and I am glad to say my good friend . " 
" He may well endorse someone else for president , " says <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> . 
" But he 's not myenemy . 
He 's my friend . 
" <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> emphasizes his solid conservative voting record -- he 's antiabortion,anti-gun control , pro-death penalty , and he favors cutting back the size andreach of the federal government , with the vehement exception of the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> . 
Hehas switched his stand on ethanol , which he once derided as a boondoggle but nowsays makes sense , given the fact that gasoline exceeds <MONEY>$ 3</MONEY> a gallon . 
He has votedto extend tax cuts that he once opposed . 
All of this is either called panderingor bridge-building , depending on your point of view . 
" John 's challenge , if he chooses to run , is to prove that he wants to be theleader of a party , not just a movement , " says <PERSON>Lindsey Graham</PERSON> . 
" And that meansyou have to reach out to people who have been adversaries on particular issues . 
" Or as <PERSON>Jon Stewart</PERSON> put it in when <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> appeared on " The Daily Show " in <DATE>April</DATE> : " You 're not freaking out on us ? 
. . . Are you going into crazy base world ? 
" <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's reply : " I 'm afraid so . 
" However much he courts the base , it will never be enough to allay the suspicionsof diehard opponents on the right , who loathe what the <ORGANIZATION>National Review</ORGANIZATION> 's RichLowry calls <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's " richly layered history of apostasy . 
" On the other side of the ideological divide , Democrats are accusing <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> ofmoving too far to the right . 
In a series of recent press releases , <ORGANIZATION>theDemocratic National Committee</ORGANIZATION> has branded <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's campaign the " Double TalkExpress , " saying he has flip-flopped on taxes , abortion rights , ethanol and hissupport for <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> . 
" The best-kept secret on the campaign trail is that <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> is n't talkingstraight to the American public -- he 's pandering to the right to get theRepublican nomination , " says <ORGANIZATION>DNC</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Stacie Paxton</PERSON> . 
" Once people learnmore about <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON> , he is going to lose those crossover votes . 
" Ask <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> who is the most likely Democratic nominee , and he unhesitantly pointsto <PERSON>Hillary Clinton</PERSON> . 
It appears to be his genuine belief but also a highlyconvenient one . 
No one scares Republicans as much as <LOCATION>Hillary</LOCATION> , and no one canmake a better case that he can slay the <ORGANIZATION>Hillary Dragon</ORGANIZATION> than <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> because ofhis appeal to independents and blue-collar Democrats.Chuck <PERSON>Yob</PERSON> is one of <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> 's two Republican national committeemen and acard-carrying conservative . 
He supported <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in <DATE>2000</DATE> but has since become closeto <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> . 
His son <PERSON>John</PERSON> , a political consultant , is working for <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> ' spolitical action committee . 
On <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's recent weekend in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> , both theYobs accompanied him to each stop , offering a running commentary on the state ' spolitical makeup . 
" <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> has not gone Republican in a presidential election since <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> ' sfather beat <PERSON>Michael Dukakis</PERSON> in <DATE>1988</DATE> , " says <PERSON>Chuck Yob</PERSON> . 
" John gives us a realchance to finally reverse that trend . 
If we want to keep the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> in 2008against <PERSON>Hillary Clinton</PERSON> , with all her money and name recognition , it 's a prettyshort list that can beat her . 
" Sen. <PERSON>Trent Lott</PERSON> , the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> Republican , is a longtime <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> antagonist whohas become a close supporter . 
He predicts that <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's problems withconservatives will fade as he makes the rounds , presses flesh and shows he ' slistening to them . 
" I do n't think <PERSON>John</PERSON> necessarily has to make the transitionfrom maverick , " says <PERSON>Lott</PERSON> . 
" That 's part of his persona and of his attraction , even to Republicans . 
He 's willing to take on big issues , and he 's dogged . 
Youmay not agree with him , but you have to admire him . 
" Here 's the other side : What choice do they have ? 
Where are they going ? 
Do theywant to win , or do they want purity ? 
" IT 'S SUNDAY NIGHT , and <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> is presiding over a small corner table at <ORGANIZATION>Joe ' sStone Crab</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Miami Beach</LOCATION> . 
He 's sipping a vodka on the rocks with an onion , andhe 's ordered some of his favorite food , stone crabs , with one of his favoritecolleagues , <PERSON>Lindsey Graham</PERSON> ( " my illegitimate son , " he quips ) , and gossipingabout his favorite subject : politics . 
They 're speculating about the prospects ofthe Republicans losing the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> or both , and conjuring upscenarios that might help turn things around.What about if <ORGANIZATION>Rumsfeld</ORGANIZATION> resigns in <DATE>October</DATE> ? 
Graham asks.McCain just smiles . 
Secretary of Defense <PERSON>Donald Rumsfeld</PERSON> is the administrationofficial whom <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> holds most responsible for mistakes in the execution of theIraq war plan and aftermath , but <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> has stopped criticizing him in public . 
" If I attack him , it hurts the president , " he says.When you break it down to individual races , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> says , he believes mostRepublicans will survive . 
But he bemoans the predicament of his close friend JoeLieberman , the <LOCATION>Connecticut</LOCATION> Democrat , who is under attack within his own partybecause of his support for the <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> war and will eventually lose a hotlycontested primary to wealthy antiwar challenger <PERSON>Ned Lamont</PERSON> . 
He sees <PERSON>Lieberman</PERSON> ' sdistress as another example of hardliners imposing ideological litmus tests onmoderate politicians.After dinner the waiter says the man at the next table has insisted on pickingup the tab . 
McCain politely declines . 
He goes over and explains to the man thatcampaign finance rules do n't allow it.More than any other Republican senator , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> has presented himself as leaderof a crusade to clean up <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> by imposing tougher rules on donations andlobbying . 
In <DATE>2002</DATE> , after a seven-year struggle , he and <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> Democrat RussFeingold rammed through a campaign finance reform law banning " soft money , " unlimited campaign contributions to political parties from corporations , tradeunions and law firms . 
The measure has probably done McCain the most damage withRepublican-dominated interest groups such as the <ORGANIZATION>National Rifle Association</ORGANIZATION> andthe antiabortion movement , which contend it has hurt their fundraisingoperations and infringed on their right of free speech . 
And it brings outMcCain 's combative <PERSON>streak.Bradley Smith</PERSON> was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Election Commission</ORGANIZATION> when theMcCain-Feingold bill became law . 
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> was put on the <ORGANIZATION>FEC</ORGANIZATION> at the behest of Sen.Mitch <PERSON>McConnell</PERSON> ( R-Ky . ) 
, an opponent of the bill , and he infuriated <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> , whobelieved <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> and his fellow commissioners were undermining the new law bydragging their feet on implementation.Smith recalls attending a committee hearing where <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> was present . 
" Ithought , Well , here he is . 
I 'll go shake his hand , break the ice , show him Ido n't have horns . 
I 'd just had abdominal surgery a few days before , and I was ina wheelchair . " 
<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> says he rolled up to <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> and held out his hand . 
McCaintook it instinctively before he realized whose it was . 
" He said , ' I 'm not goingto talk to you , you 're a bully and a coward , ' and , frankly , he did not let mesay anything . 
" Here 's a guy who goes around giving commencement speeches saying we shouldtreat each other with civility and respect , but that 's not how he treated me , " <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> says . 
" In my view , he does n't always walk the walk . 
" <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> says he was reacting to <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> 's harsh treatment of two reform proponentsat a previous <ORGANIZATION>FEC</ORGANIZATION> hearing . 
" He had bullied both of them in a very , veryinappropriate fashion . 
I did n't yell at him , I did n't curse at him . 
I just said , ' I do n't want to shake hands with you ' . 
It 's my privilege . 
" <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's temper surfaced again a few weeks ago when he scolded Sen. <PERSON>Barack Obamaof Illinois</PERSON> , one of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> 's bright new stars , for purportedlyreneging on his commitment to a compromise on lobbying reform . 
" I would like toapologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me . . . weresincere , " <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> wrote <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> in a stinging letter released by <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's office . 
" Sorry for the confusion , but please be assured I wo n't make the same mistakeagain . 
" Immigration reform is <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's latest crusade and trickiest balancing act . 
Heand Sen. <PERSON>Edward Kennedy</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> have pushed through the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> acompromise that allows for stricter enforcement of the law against illegalimmigration but also offers a mechanism under which illegals can turn themselvesin and qualify eventually for citizenship.Without <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's tenacity , <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> says , the deal would n't have happened . 
" Whereyou really saw <PERSON>John</PERSON> 's leadership was in the meetings we had early each morningwith four or five Democrats and five Republicans , " <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> recalls . 
" He stayedfocused , and he was well-informed . 
Even the Democrats listened carefully tohim . 
" For the first half of his <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> career , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> was considered a showboat bymany of his colleagues . 
But <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> and admirers in both parties say thatMcCain 's stature has grown and that he has emerged in recent years as one of thechief architects of bipartisan compromise . 
" John really is a throwback to a timewhen senators believed in the institution and made it work , " <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> says . 
" Hewants to get things done . 
" But some Republicans remain enraged by the immigration bill . 
House Republicanspassed their own version of immigration reform , one that focused strictly onenforcement , creating tougher penalties against illegals , with no prospect forcitizenship . 
On the hustings <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> has faced small but vocal protests inArizona , <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> and skepticism elsewhere . 
He says peopleoften put aside their anger after they listen for a while , and aides cite pollsindicating that more than <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of Americans favor the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> bill ( ignoring other polls that suggest the opposite ) . 
But he concedes that animportant segment of the Republican base is furiously opposed.McCain and some of his fellow Republican senators are locked in negotiationswith <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members to see if they can forge a compromise . 
While the talks areon , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> is trying to stay on his best behavior and resist the urge to condemnopponents . 
He warns that voters will punish the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> for inaction on perhaps themost important domestic issue facing Americans.Still , there are times when his passion boils over . 
" I get a little emotionalwhen I see this nativist -- and that 's the kindest word that I can use -- backlash " against illegal immigrants , he told a group of Republican activistsand potential campaign donors in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> one night in <DATE>July</DATE> . 
" Yes , they came hereillegally ; yes , they broke our laws ; yes , they have to pay a penalty for doingthat . 
But the thought of rounding up 11 million people and sending them back tothe country they came from . . . is an insult to your intelligence and , frankly , a direct contradiction of what <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's all about . 
" He was just warming up . 
" I have bitten my tongue until it 's bleeding and said : Look , we want to reach out ; we want to talk to our friends on the right ; we needto have a dialogue ; we all agree that the problem has got to be solved . " 
But , headded , " I 'm not interested in calling some soldier in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> and telling him thatI 'm deporting his parents . 
Under this <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> bill , if a young woman is illegallyin the <LOCATION>United States of America</LOCATION> , and she is raped , and she goes to a rapecounseling center , the people running the center are guilty of a felony . 
Is thatwhat <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is supposed to be about ? 
" I do n't think so . 
" AT A HEARING THIS MONTH , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> and other members of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Armed ServicesCommittee</ORGANIZATION> listen as two top military commanders describe the deterioratingsecurity situation in <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> . 
" The sectarian violence is probably as bad asI 've seen it , " says Gen. <PERSON>John P. Abizaid</PERSON> , commander of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military operationsin the Middle East.McCain questions the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> strategy of shifting troops from one Iraqi hot spot toanother without ever defeating the insurgency . 
" What I worry about is we ' replaying a game of whack-a-mole here , " he says . 
" It 's very disturbing . 
" From the beginning , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> has been an ardent supporter of the war but a vocalcritic of the way the <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> administration has conducted it . 
In hearing afterhearing , he has singled out <PERSON>Rumsfeld</PERSON> and some members of the joint chiefs ofstaff for not sending in enough troops , disbanding the Iraqi army and failing toanticipate the insurgency that arose in the aftermath of the <DATE>2003</DATE> invasion . 
" I saw we were making serious mistakes in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> and tried with everything in meto get a policy change , " he tells me . 
" We paid a heavy price for those mistakes.But saying that , I still believe the consequences of failure now would bedisastrous . 
" In some ways , he has positioned himself to the right of the administration onthe war . 
In a landmark speech <DATE>last November</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>American EnterpriseInstitute</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> called for a counterinsurgency strategy of creating " safehavens " that would require more American troops , more spending , more years ofoccupation and more casualties . 
" We must get <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> right , " he insisted at thetime.McCain says now he recognizes that with domestic public opinion so opposed tothe war , it is n't possible politically to send in more troops . 
" I do n't think hecould sell that , " he says of Bush.While the war threatens to do huge political damage to Republicans , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> ' sbackers are counting on his credibility as a military veteran and defense expertto see him through . 
Even some of the war 's most vocal critics have confidence inhis savvy and feel . 
" John never would have taken us into <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> the way <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> did , without listening to the commanders on the ground , " says <PERSON>Bob Kerrey</PERSON> , formerDemocratic senator from <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> , who like <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> is a <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> veteran.Having survived a plane crash and a North Vietnamese prison camp , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> thinksof himself as a man of a certain destiny . 
" There 's no doubt about it . 
Not thatI 'm a chosen person or anything like that . 
I just think that I 'm the luckiestguy I know . 
I mean when I 'm on a plane with <PERSON>Cindy</PERSON> and the weather gets bad , <PERSON>Isay</PERSON> , do n't worry , I 'm dying in bed . 
If I was gon na die in an airplane , it wouldhave happened long ago . 
" Officially , <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> has n't decided whether to run . 
He says he 'll sit down withCindy and the children at <ORGANIZATION>Christmastime</ORGANIZATION> and discuss it . 
Unofficially , he ' sready . 
Still he says , he 's told his staff : " Look , if we run it 's got to beenjoyable . 
I 'm not gon na spend time being unhappy and tense and ' Oh , God ' allthe time . 
" Besides , he adds , speaking of his purported friends in the media , " If I tried todo anything differently , they 'd kill me . 
" There 's one more stop on the <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> run : the town of Iron Mountain , population8 ,154 , in the <LOCATION>Upper Peninsula</LOCATION> . 
As <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's plane pulls up on the small airstrip , <PERSON>Chuck Yob</PERSON> is briefing him . 
Upper Peninsula folks call themselves " Yoopers , " asin <LOCATION>U.P.</LOCATION> , and they 're proud , rugged and individualistic . 
The area ispredominately Catholic , antiabortion and anti-gun control , but voters havetended to go Democratic in recent years because of pocketbook issues . 
McCain , <PERSON>Yob</PERSON> believes , can turn that around . 
They do n't get many celebrities up here , <PERSON>Yobsays</PERSON> , and <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> should pull in a good crowd.Sure enough . 
More than 200 people are waiting as we pull up at the <ORGANIZATION>ChippewaClub</ORGANIZATION> , a Victorian-era house that used to be the home of a mining executive backin the days when the industry thrived here . 
They start whooping and hollering asMcCain emerges , and they do n't let up for a good five minutes . 
Some are carryinghand-lettered signs with " McCain <DATE>2008</DATE> ! " 
and some are chanting his name . 
He ' smoved and excited.He tells them he 's grateful for their attendance , that he knows they could behome having dinner with their families . 
" This is really what <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is allabout , and it 's a great honor to be with you tonight . 
This is really the funpart of politics for me . 
" It shows . 
As a purple dusk descends behind his head , he launches a stump speechwith a bit more edge when he gets to <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> . 
" Look , we should acknowledge the factthat we made some serious mistakes in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Rumsfeld</PERSON> was responsible for them -- I 'll give you a little straight talk -- because we did n't have enoughtroops there . 
And the military guys knew it , and I knew it . 
But we still have towin , and we still have to prevail . 
" After the speech , the crowd mobs him for handshakes and photographs . 
A Vietnamvet in biker 's gear and a braid in his hair is sobbing . 
A World War II veteranrises out of a wheelchair to shake <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> 's hand . 
They give him presents : anUpper <LOCATION>Peninsula</LOCATION> flag , a hunting knife and a pair of antlers from a white-taileddeer . 
" <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> " is playing on the loudspeaker . 
McCain 's handlers try to clear a pathto the car , but neither the candidate nor the crowd is ready to let go . 
It takes20 minutes for <PERSON>Weaver</PERSON> and <PERSON>Yob</PERSON> to drag him from the scene.Yob likes what he sees . 
" This guy can do what <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> did for us . 
I 'm justwaiting for the starting gate to open . 
" <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> also relishes the moment . 
" That was really an amazing thing , " he sayslater , as the plane takes off for another campaign stop , another hotel room , another fundraiser . 
" Did you see that old guy in his wheelchair ? 
Oh , God , it waswonderful .
