MY BROTHER BEAT MY MOM AND DAD AND SISTER TO DEATH WITH A BASEBALL BAT.At approximately <TIME>3 a.m.</TIME> on <DATE>April 27 , 1984</DATE> , 16-year-old <PERSON>Jody Gilley</PERSON> spoke thesewords to a 911 operator in <LOCATION>Jackson County</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ore</LOCATION> . 
Two hours before , the overheadlight had flickered on in the attic bedroom she occupied in her family 's whiteclapboard house . 
Then the door to her bedroom opened , and her 18-year-oldbrother , <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> , walked in with their 11-year-old sister , <PERSON>Becky</PERSON> . 
He told <PERSON>Jody tokeep Becky</PERSON> in the room ; then he left again . 
But <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> was half-asleep anddisoriented , and <PERSON>Becky</PERSON> soon followed <PERSON>Billy downstairs.Within</PERSON> a few minutes , <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> was fully awake because <PERSON>Becky</PERSON> had started screaming.When the screams were replaced by a pounding sound , somehow <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> knew <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> washitting <PERSON>Becky</PERSON> with his baseball bat . 
And somehow she knew he 'd already killedtheir parents.Soon <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> came back into <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> 's room , his bare chest and arms spattered withblood . 
" We 're free now , " he said.Then he told her they needed to leave the house . 
Terrified both by what Billyhad done and what she feared he 'd do to her , <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> pulled on clothes and walkeddownstairs , past the body of her sister and near the bodies of her mother andfather , and followed her brother out into the <TIME>night</TIME> . 
They got into theirparents ' car and drove to a friend 's home . 
When , at nearly <TIME>3 a.m.</TIME> , <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> left toget cigarettes , <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> finally told her friend and the friend 's parents what hadhappened and then made her call to 911 . 
Within hours , her brother was arrested . 
Within days , her parents and <PERSON>Becky</PERSON> wereburied in a cemetery near their <LOCATION>Medford</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION> , home . 
And within months , <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> hadchanged her last name and begun , as she would later call it , the story of herrebirth.ON A BLUSTERY DAY IN <DATE>FEBRUARY , 24 years later</DATE> , 40-year-old <PERSON>Jody Arlington</PERSON> sitsin a small glass conference room at the <ORGANIZATION>American Film Institute Silver Theatrein Silver Spring</ORGANIZATION> with the team behind the Silverdocs : AFI/Discovery <ORGANIZATION>ChannelDocumentary Film Festival</ORGANIZATION> , which opens this week . 
They are four women dressedstylishly in shades of black , white and gray , armed with BlackBerries and <ORGANIZATION>Maclaptops</ORGANIZATION> . 
They talk frenetically , interrupting one another , planning strategy . 
Atone point , someone mentions there 's a problem . 
" What 's going on ? " 
Arlington says . 
" What do I need to fix ? 
" Someone needs to be called to get entree to someone else . 
Arlington is acommunications strategist specializing in festival and entertainment publicrelations . 
She managed publicity for the <ORGANIZATION>Sundance Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>2006</DATE> and <DATE>2007</DATE> andhas been <PERSON>Silverdocs</PERSON> ' public relations manager since <DATE>2004</DATE> . 
Her contacts in thedocumentary film world run deep . 
She types an e-mail on her BlackBerry and hitssend . 
Problem solved.Leaving the theater after the meeting , <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> sets a pace so rapid that itborders on a run . 
" I feel like if I slow down , I 'll lose my balance , " she says.It 's an observation that also applies to the way she 's lived since she ended oneself and determinedly set out to create another.Her re-creation has been successful . 
She has been a manager at public affairsfirm <ORGANIZATION>Burson-Marsteller</ORGANIZATION> and a vice president at communications firmFleishman-Hillard , as well as chief of staff of President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> ' sNational Campaign Against Youth Violence . 
She is now building a thrivingentertainment division at communications firm <PERSON>Weber Merritt</PERSON> and is one of thefounders , and the director , of the <ORGANIZATION>Impact Film Festival</ORGANIZATION> , which will , for thefirst time , present films dealing with key social issues to lawmakers , candidates and delegates at the Democratic and Republican national conventionsthis summer.Arlington has also created a satisfying personal life in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . 
She ismarried to <PERSON>Franck Cordes</PERSON> , director of marketing and administration for theFoundation for the <ORGANIZATION>National Archives</ORGANIZATION> , and has a circle of loyal and lovingfriends who make up what she calls her " found family . " 
On weekends , she wearsher auburn hair in pigtails and knocks around <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> . 
She drinks Starbuckslattes , reads trashy novels as well as serious literature , watches movies in bedon a jumbo-size , flat-screen TV . 
She is both ambitious and goofy . 
She laughsoften . 
She is , as she says , " shockingly normal . 
" But normalcy is a significant accomplishment for someone whose past contains oneof the most abnormal acts imaginable , as the world will learn this week with thepublication of While They Slept : An Inquiry Into the Murder of a Family , anonfiction account of the <PERSON>Gilley</PERSON> family killings written by <PERSON>Kathryn Harrison</PERSON> . 
Itis the story of a brother who claims he committed murder to protect his oldestsister ; and it is also the story of that surviving sister , who views her brotheras a tormentor -- not a protector -- and so must live as the recipient of anunwanted " gift . " 
In delving into murder , psychology and family dynamics , thebook explores terrain similar to that of <ORGANIZATION>Truman Capote</ORGANIZATION> 's In Cold Blood . 
But , inWhile They Slept , the murderer and victims share the same blood , creating a taleat once gothic and Greek , Freudian and Shakespearean , taboo and tragic.As much as <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> wants the story to be told , and as much as she hopes somegreater good will come of it , this is an unsettling moment for her . 
Within thepages of the book , she is reunited with <PERSON>Jody Gilley</PERSON> -- her former self -- andwith <PERSON>Billy Gilley Jr.</PERSON> , the brother she has n't seen since she testified for theprosecution at his murder trial 24 years ago . 
She has also learned that <PERSON>Billyrecently</PERSON> won the right to a resentencing hearing on the basis of ineffectivecounsel during the sentencing phase of his trial . 
In <DATE>1984</DATE> , he was sentenced to90 years in prison without parole : three consecutive life sentences for histhree murdered family members . 
The resentencing hearing , which is expected totake place within a year or so , presents the possibility that he could be freedafter serving 60 years , or 30 years , or even sooner , a possibility Arlingtonwills herself not to dwell upon . 
" With <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> out of prison , " she says simply , " Iwould n't feel safe . 
" For nearly a quarter-century , <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> has survived -- has thrived -- by racingtoward a future of her own making . 
Now her past is racing toward the present.IN THE WAKE OF THE MURDERS , people advised <PERSON>Jody Gilley</PERSON> to return to normal asquickly as possible , " but there was n't a normal to go back to , " she says . 
Nearlyevery trace of what had been her life was obliterated on that <DATE>April</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> in1984 . 
And , too , life in her family had never been normal or happy or nurturing -- it was nothing she wanted to return to.Linda and <PERSON>Bill Gilley Sr.</PERSON> were high school dropouts and itinerant farm workerswho married young and immediately began the pattern of frequent and frequentlyviolent fights over <PERSON>Bill</PERSON> 's drinking and infidelity that would characterize theirentire marriage . 
After years of living hand-to-mouth , migrating between <LOCATION>Oregonand California</LOCATION> for seasonal work , the Gilleys settled in a rented house inMedford , then a small , rural town in southwestern <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> , in <DATE>1970</DATE> , and Bill Sr.found work as a tree trimmer . 
That led to more financial stability -- in <DATE>1976</DATE> , the family bought the clapboard house at 1452 <PERSON>Ross Lane</PERSON> , where the murders wouldoccur <DATE>eight years later</DATE> -- but not to more emotional stability . 
The fightsbetween Bill and <PERSON>Linda</PERSON> continued , now with an exacerbating factor : <PERSON>Billy Jr</PERSON> . 
Bythe time <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> was in second grade , as <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> writes , he was having trouble inschool and difficulty getting along with other kids . 
By age 10 , he was theleader of a shoplifting ring . 
At 15 , he was arrested for burglary and arson anddescribed as a " very troubled young man " by a caseworker . 
At 16 , he 'd droppedout of high school.In addition to the offenses <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> committed that were recognized publicly , therewere others known only by <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> . 
Soon after the Gilleys moved into the <PERSON>Ross Lanehouse</PERSON> , 12-year-old <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> discovered a stash of prescription drugs left by thehome 's previous owners . 
Stocking his Hot Wheels miniature car case with thebottles of pills , <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> says , <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> planned to take the case to school and stylehimself as a drug dealer . 
When <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> discovered the case and hid it as a prefaceto telling their mother , <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> " chased me around the house and the yard , wrestling me down and sexually attacking me , " she says . 
By attack , she meansthat he put his hand up her skirt and tried to shove his entire hand into hervagina . 
" I did n't tell my parents because I was too afraid of him . 
" She was 9 then . 
Soon afterward , she began waking up at night with the unsettlingsense that she 'd been touched while she was sleeping . 
" Eventually , I found Billyin my room in the middle of the <TIME>night</TIME> , and he 'd have lame excuses , and I put twoand two together , " she says . 
" When I saw it was real , it was a relief . " 
Thistime she did tell her mother . 
" But then my parents did n't believe me . 
" <PERSON>Linda</PERSON> and Bill Sr. bullied their children , as well as each other , <PERSON>Jody says.While Billy</PERSON> faced the brunt of his father 's physical abuse -- whipping , hitting , punches in the face , often accompanied by demeaning taunts -- <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> fell prey toher mother 's outbursts and bizarre punishments . 
<PERSON>Linda Gilley</PERSON> would sit on Jodyand blow cigarette smoke in her face and limit her daughter 's access to books , sometimes tearing them up in public if <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> brought them on family outings . 
Shewould ground <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> for months on end for small infractions . 
Her mother 's behaviortoward her was psychologically abusive , <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> says . 
" There is n't really away to convey the atmosphere , the unrelenting chaos and unpredictability andmeanness . 
" But what devastated <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> most was that her mother did n't believe her when shetold her parents that <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> was molesting her . 
And later , when <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> told hermother that her father had propositioned her -- that , six months before themurders , she says , her father had offered her " all the money in his pocket if hecould fool around with me " -- her mother also did not believe her , at least notat first.In <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> 's mind , <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> writes , their shared suffering at the hands of theirparents made him and <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> allies . 
But because she felt victimized by <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> aswell as by her parents , <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> says , she viewed him as a predator -- not adefender or even a fellow prisoner . 
He was another threat she had to guardagainst , another reason to escape into a world of her own , when her motherallowed it . 
" My allies , " she says , " were the alternative realities in books . 
" So , in the wake of the murders , there was no " normal " to return to . 
Insteadthere was shock , grief , worry and guilt -- and also opportunity . 
Suddenly , orphanhood had freed <PERSON>Jody Gilley</PERSON> to re-create herself and her life . 
She chose aguru to help in that re-creation : <PERSON>Thad Guyer</PERSON> , her legal aid attorney , who wouldbecome her legal guardian.ON THE DAY AFTER THE MURDERS , <PERSON>Guyer</PERSON> was in criminal court in <LOCATION>Medford</LOCATION> on otherbusiness when <PERSON>Billy Gilley</PERSON> 's arraignment came up . 
He remembers hearing the judgeread the murder counts -- ending each with the statement " by killing said personwith a baseball bat " -- but he did n't think much of it . 
" For me , it was justanother murder , " says <PERSON>Guyer</PERSON> . 
" I was back out at the office the <DATE>next day</DATE> , and Iremember my receptionist coming in and saying : ' Hey , you know those murders?Well , the sister who escaped is out in our waiting room , just walking around.She wants to see a lawyer right away . ' 
" <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> had come to the county legal aid office for help applying to be adopted bya neighboring family with whom she was staying . 
" She was obviously a veryintelligent girl , " says <PERSON>Guyer</PERSON> , who was a 34-year-old <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> vet who had handledcivil rights cases in the South before coming to <LOCATION>Medford</LOCATION> in <DATE>1982</DATE> . 
" But you do n'tgo from ' My parents were killed <TIME>last night</TIME> ' to ' These people want to adopt metoday . ' 
I counseled her that what she should let me do was a guardianship . 
" A few days later , <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Guyer</PERSON> to accompany her to the funeral for herparents and <PERSON>Becky</PERSON> . 
" If you 're a criminal lawyer and see all kinds of horriblethings , you 're not affected by this situation , " he says . 
" I think I wasinstantly the most credible person in her life because I was detached . 
I ' mcertain everyone else was asking , ' What happened ? ' 
. . . I did n't try to comforther . 
I just did lawyerly stuff . 
" Within a few months , <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> 's living arrangement at the neighbors ' soured , andGuyer worked to find other options . 
One was with the local victim 's assistanceadvocate , and two were with local families with children . 
" I said she had topick , " says <PERSON>Guyer</PERSON> . 
" She said : ' I do n't want to live with any of them . 
I want tolive with you . ' 
" <PERSON>Guyer</PERSON> told her his marriage was on the rocks , and he was n't sure where he wasgoing to be living . 
But <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> had identified him , she says , as " a rational , knowledgeable person who wanted to help me , treated me like an adult andprovided counsel , while also being fun and cool , or trying to be cool . 
I wasattracted to his level of insight and analysis , " she says . 
" It felt right , forwhatever reason . 
" <PERSON>Guyer</PERSON> relented , and soon <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> was living with him -- first in the house heshared with his wife and then in a house he shared with a roommate -- flying toCalifornia in his private plane and attending rock concerts with him . 
It was onthe way to a <ORGANIZATION>Billy Idol</ORGANIZATION> concert in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> in <DATE>August 1984</DATE> that she chose hernew name . 
In a few weeks , she would start 11th grade , and she knew that studentswhose last names started with the letters at the beginning of the alphabet gotto enroll in classes first . 
So , she made a decision : The next street name shesaw that began with A through F would be her new last name . 
Arlington Boulevardcame into sight , and <PERSON>Jody Arlington</PERSON> was born.Arlington 's life with <PERSON>Guyer</PERSON> was far removed from anything she had everexperienced as a member of the <PERSON>Gilley</PERSON> family . 
Not only was she getting to fly ina private plane -- she was soon learning how to fly one herself . 
But the mostradical change <PERSON>Guyer</PERSON> offered was his belief in her . 
He told her she was smartand talented , a " quality person . " 
He had attended <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown University</ORGANIZATION> , and hesaid that , with strategy and determination , she could attend <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> , too.Guyer recognized that his arrangement with <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> was unorthodox -- a34-year-old , soon-to-be-divorced man acting as the guardian for a teenage girl.But for him it made sense as both an extension of his work as a legal aidlawyer , and as a kind of karmic payback to two adults who 'd helped him in hisyounger years . 
When <PERSON>Guyer</PERSON> was 17 and homeless in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> , a family took him in , fed him and gave him mentoring . 
And when he was a student at <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> , hisdebate coach , <PERSON>James Unger</PERSON> , offered him a place in his home for a modest rent , along with several other debaters . 
" He made me believe in myself and what Icould achieve , and I did the same thing , exactly , for <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> , " says <PERSON>Guyer</PERSON> , whocontinues to work part time for the legal aid office in <LOCATION>Medford</LOCATION> and also doesemployment and whistle-blower cases for his own law firm based out of <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> andSeattle.For a while , <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> floundered , skipping class and hanging out with " dead-end " kids . 
But by mid-semester of her junior year -- less than a yearafter the murders -- she had gotten serious about her future . 
" The jewel hadbeen placed in front of me , " she says . 
" Once I had a goal , I stuffed the painaway and said I 'd deal with it later . 
" Of course , she could n't stuff it away completely . 
There were times in her lasttwo years of high school when she 'd listen to Pink Floyd -- <ORGANIZATION>Roger Waters</ORGANIZATION> alwaysmade her feel better , she says , because he was so depressed -- and drive by thecemetery where her parents and <PERSON>Becky</PERSON> were buried . 
Once she thought she glimpsedher mother in a store , and sometimes she 'd catch herself wondering when herfather would return home from work . 
Several times , she saw a beat-up car pullinto a parking lot and feared it might be <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> . 
And whenever she 'd see girlsBecky 's age , she 'd cringe because her sister was n't among them . 
During thenearly two years <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> lived with <PERSON>Guyer</PERSON> , he heard her talk about the murdersand saw her cry only a few times -- and , when she did , it was almost alwaysabout <PERSON>Becky</PERSON> . 
Sometimes she would replay the time when the family was shopping atKmart and <PERSON>Becky</PERSON> wanted to borrow <MONEY>$ 10</MONEY> to buy a pair of parachute pants . 
" I hadbeen babysitting , and I had the money , but I would n't lend it to her , and Ireally regret that , " says <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> . 
" Without a doubt , I shed the most tears forBecky . 
I had grief for what had happened to my parents . 
But I also had grief forwhat I had n't gotten from them . " 
But mostly she did not grieve , and mostly shedid not look back , because her grief -- and her past -- was too complicated forher , as a teenager , to understand.It was difficult for many in <LOCATION>Medford</LOCATION> to understand , as well -- a young mankilling his entire family except for one sister ? 
Since she 'd been spared , shemust be complicit , some assumed . 
" I had friends whose parents forbade them to bearound me , " says <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> . 
" I was the bogeyman for some people . " 
Rumors swirledthat she was a nymphomaniac , that she ate babies , that she was a Satanist , aswell as that school officials were taking bets on when she would crack up . 
" These things were bemusing -- I was confident in myself and the truth , and theopinions of strangers were mostly irrelevant to me -- but also very painful andinfuriating . 
I was a teen who wanted acceptance and to fit in . 
" In the end , however , <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> says she owes a debt of gratitude to those whodoubted her . 
" Their having written me off and being so callous was soinfuriating , it was a magnificent inspiration to ' show them , ' " she says.AFTER GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL IN <DATE>1986</DATE> , <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> flew to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to beginan internship on Capitol Hill that <PERSON>Guyer</PERSON> had arranged , and , for the next fewyears , a succession of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 's elite took her under their wings . 
First , itwas renowned Democratic political consultant <PERSON>Robert Shrum</PERSON> , a former mentor ofGuyer 's , who gave her a job at his firm . 
Then , it was <PERSON>Shrum</PERSON> 's now-wife , <PERSON>writerMarylouise Oates</PERSON> , who arranged an interview for <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> for an internship atthe <ORGANIZATION>American Film Institute</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> . 
Then , it was TV and film producerand writer/director <PERSON>George Stevens Jr.</PERSON> , and his wife , <PERSON>Liz</PERSON> , who offered Arlingtona room in their Georgetown mansion and introduced her to social maven and eventplanner <PERSON>Carolyn Peachey</PERSON> , for whom she worked off and on for almost 20 years.The access to power and wealth was exciting -- how far <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> was fromMedford , how far from <PERSON>Jody Gilley</PERSON> 's attic bedroom -- but alienating . 
Arlingtonrecalls <PERSON>Shrum</PERSON> once pointed at the TV and asked her if she recognized the manwhose face was on the screen . 
When she said she did n't , he told her it was HenryKissinger . 
Another time , she answered the phone at the Stevenses ' house to hearVernon <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> ask , " What 's George 's handicap ? " 
Later , she said to <PERSON>GeorgeStevens</PERSON> , " I did n't know you had a disability . " 
" It was very surreal . 
It was the exact opposite of what I 'd grown up with , " saysArlington . 
" I came to <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> with a suitcase of polyester clothes I thought wereprofessional , but were too old for me . 
It took me forever to learn how to dress.I had to memorize <ORGANIZATION>Tiffany 's Table Manners for Teenagers</ORGANIZATION> because sometimes theStevenses would take me to the <LOCATION>Palm</LOCATION> . 
I had social anxiety and shame , but also asense of pride for surviving . 
" Five years after the murders , <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> entered <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown University</ORGANIZATION> , and , fromher first moment there , she decided she had to make up for the first 16 years ofher life by reading and learning all she could . 
Rather than gravitate towardsubjects she loved -- theater , art or opera -- she sought to understand morefully what had happened to her and what the effects would be . 
To give herselfthe latitude to do that , she designed her own major in interdisciplinary studiesand history . 
" I took courses in memory and amnesia . 
I did an independent study in orphans , " she says . 
" I really wanted to know , to the degree that it 's knowable , what thesigns of health and un-health are . 
I did n't want to get stuck . 
I did n't want tobe depressed and limited by my issues . " 
When she read All Quiet on the WesternFront , she recognized herself in <PERSON>Erich Maria Remarque</PERSON> 's descriptions ofsuffering in battle . 
" We see men living with their skulls blown open , " he wrote . 
" We see soldiers run with their two feet cut off , they stagger on theirsplintered stumps into the next shell-hole . " 
" I felt like I was running on emotional stumps , like the foundation had been cutout from under me , " says <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> . 
" I obsessively collected quotes and passagesfrom literature . 
When I got down , I would focus on the memorized quotes and liftmyself out of it . " 
Though she saw a therapist intermittently for several yearsat <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> , she says the therapy was far less instrumental in her healingthan the comfort , understanding and inspiration she found in literature , particularly Holocaust literature.She immersed herself in the works of Primo <PERSON>Levi</PERSON> , <PERSON>Bruno Bettelheim</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>ElieWiesel</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I was trying to understand the human psyche in extreme situations , " shesays . 
" I saw that , given the right environment , we are all capable of terribleacts , but also great acts of courage and humanity . " 
While the Holocaustrepresented an especially bleak moment in history , " how the survivors dealt withthat darkness and turned away from the void and found hope and meaning wasinspirational that I could , too . " 
Through her Holocaust studies , <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> alsoencountered a kind of cold comfort that what she 'd suffered had in no wayequaled history 's worst suffering . 
" I had not been raped , mutilated , tortured , starved , " she says.She also looked to the writers of Holo-caust literature for insight intosurvivor guilt . 
She felt guilty because her anger at her parents on the day ofthe murders -- a day when she 'd skipped school and they 'd found out andthreatened to punish her -- may have given <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> the impetus to carry out thekillings . 
She felt guilty for not knowing to keep <PERSON>Becky</PERSON> in her bedroom thatnight . 
And she felt guilty because her life was better -- not worse -- after themurders than before . 
" There were all these wonderful experiences , and I thought , ' How can I enjoy this bounty ? ' " 
she says.Like many survivors , <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> felt a powerful need to testify about what she ' dexperienced . 
At first , she published personal essays under various pseudonyms inGeorgetown 's literary magazine . 
Then , as a senior , she decided to write herthesis about the murder of her family . 
Her initial plan was to write a straightmemoir , but when she tried to begin , she felt paralyzed . 
So , instead , she wrotean odd and chilling document called " Death Faces " that narrates the murders inher brother 's voice . 
In its amoral view of violence , " Death Faces " echoes <PERSON>BretEaston Ellis</PERSON> 's American Psycho ; in the way <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> comments about herselfthrough the character of <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> , it echoes <PERSON>Gertrude Stein</PERSON> 's The Autobiography ofAlice <PERSON>B. Toklas</PERSON> -- except that <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> uses the technique of indirection notto enhance her greatness , as <PERSON>Stein</PERSON> does , but to excoriate herself . 
At one pointin " Death Faces , " the <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> character says , " <PERSON>Jody Arlington</PERSON> , the sister of asociopathic killer who made it all possible , metamorphosed on the graves of herparents into an academically polished , richly cultured , well-traveled socialclimber . " 
At another , he says , " I suspect <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> will never allow herself to giveme my share of the credit for having blasted her free of the imprisoning gravityof that family which was already dead when I untethered its members from therotting corpse . " 
In " Death Faces , " <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> has <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> express her own worstfears about herself : that she is morally culpable for her family 's deaths andmorally reprehensible for benefiting from them.When <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> circulated her thesis to literary agents after she graduated in1993 , all reacted similarly : She had to write the story in her own voice if itwere to have a chance of being published . 
Some also suggested that she needed tovisit <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> in prison for the story to succeed . 
But she was n't sure she couldwrite a memoir and had no desire to visit <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> , and so she put " Death Faces " away . 
She moved to <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> , where she helped a friend launch a cycling tour , thenlived in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> , where she joined Equality Now , an international humanrights organization working to end violence and discrimination against girls andwomen , before returning to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> . 
In <DATE>2000</DATE> , she says , she begana three-year attempt to recast " Death Faces " as a memoir , trying " every trick inthe writer 's handbook , " and even working with several ghostwriters . 
" It was mySisyphean task , and I could n't do it , " she says . 
" It was too painful . 
Whenever Iwould sit down to write it , I would fracture . 
" <PERSON>KATHRYN HARRISON</PERSON> FIRST HEARD <LOCATION>ARLINGTON</LOCATION> 'S NAME 13 YEARS AGO during a phoneconversation with her literary agent , <PERSON>Amanda</PERSON> " Binky " Urban . 
Urban told her she ' djust met with a woman whose brother had killed their parents and younger sisterand who wanted to write a memoir about it . 
" There was something about the storyI found completely compelling . 
It did n't let go of me , and I kept thinking aboutit , and I really wanted to know why and explore it , " says <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> . 
" Every yearor so afterward , I 'd ask my agent whatever happened with that book , because Iwanted to read it . 
" It came up again in early <DATE>2005</DATE> , while <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> was in a meeting with Urban andan editor at <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> . 
" I said again , ' So , whatever happened tothat book ? ' 
Binky said , ' <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> is never going to write that book . ' " 
" I 'll write it , " <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> said.On <DATE>March 20 , 2005</DATE> , she sent <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> an e-mail , explaining her interest . 
" WereI to consider your life and what came to pass during that life , it would not bemy appropriating your story . 
No one can do that , " <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> wrote . 
" I 'm justtrying , as you may be yourself , to understand , to get some kind of hold on whathappened to you , and how it is that you continue in your life , when that lifewas violently interrupted and had to be begun again . " 
<PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> ended with , " Ica n't tell you how your story has preyed on me -- but I 'll try . 
" When <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> received the e-mail , she was immediately , if cautiously , interested . 
<PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> is the author of six novels and five nonfiction books , mostnotably the controversial <DATE>1997</DATE> memoir The Kiss , which chronicles the four-yearsexual affair she had with her father starting at age 20 . 
Arlington had read TheKiss and admired <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> 's " fearlessness and her willingness to go places Iwould n't go , " she says . 
" I was intrigued with the idea of the story gettingwritten by someone with such writerly gifts , who could crack the puzzle I couldnot . 
" A few weeks later , <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> met <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Sake Club on Connecticut Avenue NW.Sitting</ORGANIZATION> in the restaurant that evening , the two must have appeared to be sisters -- slight women with long hair who talked about the most intimate things.Indeed , <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> says , she felt a strong kinship with <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> from thebeginning . 
As <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> sees it , both have pasts marked by a taboo so powerfulthat it sets them apart ; both , as she writes in While They Slept , " had aprevious self who no longer exists . 
" When <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> decided to cede her story to <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> , she felt a huge sense ofrelief , a lightening of her psychic load . 
" I do n't think there is anyone whowould be as interested and engaged in the material as she would be , " saysArlington . 
" She was willing to become obsessed with it . 
" On an evening this <DATE>spring</DATE> , <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> and her husband , <PERSON>Cordes</PERSON> , are holed up intheir cozy <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> apartment , eating takeout Asian food and laughing as theyspeculate about a movie version of <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> 's book . 
" In my fantasy , " saysArlington , " <LOCATION>Sofia</LOCATION> Coppola directs , and <ORGANIZATION>Dakota Fanning</ORGANIZATION> plays me . 
" <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> rented this apartment when she returned to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and furnished itin one fell swoop out of the <ORGANIZATION>Ballard Designs</ORGANIZATION> catalogue . 
" I literally looked at apicture of an entryway in their catalogue and ordered everything and set it upjust like the picture , " she says . 
When <PERSON>Cordes</PERSON> moved in in <DATE>2004</DATE> , he immediatelysaid <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> 's " dentist office art " had to go . 
It 's been replaced with severalpieces the couple has collected , the most striking of which is " Easy Bake Bear " by <LOCATION>Ana Bagayan</LOCATION> . 
In the painting , everything is awry : A mouse ignores a hunk ofcheese ; a rabbit is blind to a carrot within easy grabbing distance ; and alittle girl has just baked the dismembered head of a teddy bear in her Easy-BakeOven . 
" I love this painting because everyone in it is at war with themselves , " says Arlington.The apartment is devoid of <PERSON>Gilley</PERSON> family mementos save one -- a tiny , framedphotograph that sits on an end table in the living room . 
In it , <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> is 5or 6 years old , wearing a princess costume and holding a stuffed horse . 
Hermother is behind her . 
The few other artifacts she 'd once had from her life asJody <PERSON>Gilley</PERSON> -- including the journals she 'd written in almost daily since highschool -- are gone . 
" After 9/11 , I was just struck by all of the paper floatingfrom the sky , and all of a sudden those boxes in my closet seemed burdensome , " she says . 
" I needed to get rid of them . " 
One day she carried the boxes out tothe curb for the garbage collectors to haul away.The second bedroom in the apartment houses artifacts from the couple 's collegedays -- <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> collected Batman figures , <PERSON>Cordes</PERSON> collected pirate toys -- andtheir ongoing collection of graphic novels . 
It also serves as a studio forCordes , an artist and musician . 
There he is working on drawings to accompany astory <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> wants to create as a graphic novel , one her mother often toldher when she was younger . 
" It 's about a time when I was little and pre-verbal , and <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> and I were playing out front of our house , and our parents wereinside , " she says . 
" All of a sudden , my parents heard me screaming . 
They runoutside and find me completely covered in [ excrement ] . 
I had fallen into an openseptic tank hole . 
Billy had no trace . . . on him -- he had n't pulled me out ofthe hole . 
He said an angel pulled me out . " 
Amid the chaos and horror ofArlington 's family history , the story represents a miraculous moment , and a rareflight into fantasy for someone who describes herself as practical and " utilitarian to a fault . " 
It 's also a moment that predates <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> 's fear ofher brother.Cordes and <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> met at a <DATE>2004</DATE> gala for the <ORGANIZATION>National Archives</ORGANIZATION> that shehelped plan , and within a year , they 'd eloped . 
" It sounds cheesy , but when Jodytold me her story , immediately there was this common link that we got throughour difficult childhoods , " says <PERSON>Cordes</PERSON> , 38 . 
He says his own past includes beingseparated from his mother at age 5 and suffering three months of sexual abusewhile on a sailing trip at age 13 . 
At first , <PERSON>Cordes</PERSON> reacted more hesitantly than <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> to <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> 's interestin writing a book about the murders . 
As an artist himself , he understood thatHarrison would write from her own point of view . 
But he ultimately supported theidea because he knew his wife wanted the story to be told and because he saw herrelief at shedding the responsibility to tell it herself.The relief <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> felt , however , was soon tempered by the actual process ofcollaborating on the book . 
Not only did she have to spend more time than she ' danticipated talking about her past to communicate her version of the events thatled to the murders , she also had to directly confront <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> 's version -- whichis not only different from hers , but based on what she calls several " pathological lies . 
" Billy crafted some of these stories in the direct aftermath of the murders tospread the guilt , <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> says . 
And some , she says , he crafted years later tosupport his appeal for a new trial , in which he argued that the murder was aclassic parricide case -- that he 'd killed their parents ( and , inadvertently , <PERSON>Becky</PERSON> ) as a direct result of their abuse of him and <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> . 
Billy denies that hemolested <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> , claiming instead that their father raped her -- and that he triedin vain to protect her . 
This <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> adamantly refutes , saying , " Why would Ideny my father raping me when I admit that he propositioned me and that mybrother molested me ? 
" In <DATE>1999</DATE> , at the request of a federal public defender working on <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> 's appealfor a new trial , <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> completed an affidavit in which she corroboratedBilly 's account of physical and emotional abuse inflicted by their parents . 
Sherefused , however , to validate his characterization of himself as her protector . 
" Some of the most threatening letters he sent from prison said , ' You have totell them how I protected you and <PERSON>Becky</PERSON> , ' ? " 
says <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> . 
" He never once did . 
" In one letter <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> quotes in While They Slept , <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> writes , " If you refuseto help me I will still get out , but it may take longer and cost you yourfreedom . 
" But the points at which <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> 's and <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> 's stories clash most powerfully are inhis claims that on the evening of the murders he told her he was going to killtheir parents and that she signaled her approval . 
She counters that , while sheand <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> had occasionally fantasized about the deaths of their parents , she wasneither aware of his plan that night nor in support of it . 
In <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> 's version , <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> is complicit , if not in acting with him , then in not acting against him . 
InJody 's version , she is unknowing -- as shocked by the murders as the <PERSON>victimsthemselves.To Harrison</PERSON> , the clash is just one of many in the " Rashomon " - like saga . 
" I wasworking with a brother and a sister who had conflicting versions , and I wantedto remain faithful to both of their versions and yet also try to reveal whatevertruth I could , " she says . 
" There were only two people in the <TIME>house that night</TIME> , <PERSON>Jody and Billy</PERSON> , who can tell what happened . 
Those are the people who saw whathappened and know what happened , and that 's all we have left . 
And maybe theydo n't even know . 
Memory is so slippery . 
" Just as <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> had predicted , <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> became obsessed with the murders , immersing herself in what she came to call " Gilley-alia . " 
She traced both sidesof the family several generations back , tracked down records of <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> 's numerousinteractions with police and caseworkers , interviewed friends and neighbors ofthe family , drew one timeline after another to chronicle the progression ofevents leading to the murders . 
And in <DATE>November 2005</DATE> , <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> traveled to <ORGANIZATION>SnakeRiver Correctional Institution</ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION>Oregon</LOCATION> to interview <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> , who was 40years old and had served 21 years of his 90-year sentence . 
" I had no idea who I was going to meet , " says <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> . 
" When you think of amurderer , you think of a hardened character . 
This is a man who is self-effacing , soft-spoken , thoughtful . 
I never had a sense that I could ask him a questionthat would rattle his equanimity . 
But I think that 's because he 's less honestthan <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> . 
So much of his telling his story to himself has been coming up with anarrative that excuses his behavior . 
Because he 's being punished by the world , he 's in a position to justify himself . 
" <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> " is out in the world , free , in the position to question herself , " <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> says . 
" She has a permanent inquisitory trial set up against herself inwhich she searches for moral culpability . 
" In <DATE>fall 2006</DATE> , <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> sent <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> the first draft of While They Slept , expecting her to correct factual errors and perhaps take issue with some of thebook 's conclusions . 
What <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> got instead , she says , was a 27-page , single-spaced , e-mailed list of bulleted points from " someone who felt suddenlynaked and terrified -- and misjudged . " 
" Her first response was like an immune response -- she had a really powerfulnegative response , " recalls <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> . 
" <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> is the problematic character . 
Imean , he bludgeoned his family with a baseball bat . 
My effort to humanize him , to make him a person , created a first draft that leaned more toward his tellingof things . 
That was upsetting to her . 
" <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> 's first draft was n't just upsetting , says <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> -- it wasinaccurate . 
<PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> " wanted a ' he said/she said , ' ? " 
says <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> . 
" But to sayit 's a ' he said/she said ' ignores the body of evidence presented by the state ofBilly 's previous criminal record and behavioral disorders . 
There was a recordfrom a doctor saying <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> had a personality disorder and would n't learn fromhis mistakes . 
It showed he had an ongoing personality disorder long before themurders occurred . 
That really sounded like the Billy I had grown up with . 
" In a way , her feelings about <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> 's mental instability echo something she saidto the 911 operator 24 years ago . 
" Do you know why he [ <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> ] would do something like this ? " 
the operator asked . 
" I mean , there 's been a lot . . . We have had a lot of , um , family problems , " <PERSON>Jody Gilley</PERSON> replied . 
" But I never think anything bad enough to actually killthem . 
" That is yet another point of conflict between <PERSON>Billy Gilley</PERSON> 's and <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> ' sversions of the truth . 
In <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> 's telling , their parents were villains , and thechildren were innocent victims . 
As <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> sees it , her parents were certainlynot loving or nurturing , but they were victims , too -- victims of their owntroubled upbringings , of extreme poverty , isolation , social alienation and lackof education . 
" People really do change . 
I 've changed over the decades , " shesays . 
" I ca n't discount that they might have changed , too . 
" In many ways , <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> 's " immune response " to <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> 's first draft paralleledher reaction <DATE>several years earlier</DATE> to a play her friend <PERSON>Roberto Aguirre-Sacasawrote</PERSON> based on her family 's slayings . 
Arlington and <PERSON>Sacasa</PERSON> had met and becomeclose at <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> -- <PERSON>Sacasa</PERSON> proposed marriage to <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> , even though he isgay . 
After college , he entered <ORGANIZATION>Yale University</ORGANIZATION> to study playwriting , and when hetold <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> that he wanted to write about the murder of her family , she wassupportive . 
However , in his play " Ghost Children , " which had its New Yorkpremiere at Second Stage Theatre in <DATE>2004</DATE> , <PERSON>Sacasa</PERSON> changed the facts of themurders " to heighten the drama , " he says . 
In his version , after " <PERSON>Ben Gilley</PERSON> " brings <PERSON>Becky</PERSON> up to " <PERSON>Abby Gilley</PERSON> 's " bedroom , <PERSON>Becky</PERSON> asks to get into bed withAbby . 
Abby refuses and sends her back downstairs to her death.When <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> saw the play , she burst into tears , as <PERSON>Sacasa</PERSON> recalls . 
" I said toRoberto , ' That is the most critical thing in my life , and you made it a tawdrything , ' ? " 
says <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> . 
" There 's a million years of guilt in that . 
" Sacasa explained to <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> that he 'd only written a play -- not thedefinitive story of her life . 
But he was rattled nonetheless . 
" To see heremotional response , it was kind of a shock . 
It was the first time I saw the deepwounds there , " he says . 
" I was very scared when it happened , scared that ourfriendship would be irreparably damaged , scared that I had ruined the story forJody . " 
But the friendship survived , and " Ghost Children " continues to beperformed around the country.Sacasa , who also writes comic books and for the <ORGANIZATION>HBO</ORGANIZATION> series " Big Love , " recentlyread the beginning of While They Slept and says he and <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> share afascination with <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> 's story . 
" I 've always been a little like KathrynHarrison , " he says , " attracted to dark or crime stories , lurid stories , horrorstories . " 
And , too , at the time he and <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> became friends , he was still in thecloset and struggling with wanting to become a writer despite his parents ' wishes that he pursue law . 
" I never endured what she did , " he says , " but Ifostered a kinship with <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> as a fellow outsider . " 
As <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> says , " I am amuse to everyone . 
" After receiving <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> 's 27-page e-mail , " I think I went to bed for a month , " says <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> , only half-joking . 
Indeed , as it had for <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> , the bookturned out to be a more difficult collaboration than <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> had expected . 
Eventhough <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> acknowledges a thirst for true crime and " pulpy accounts ofmurder , " she found the <PERSON>Gilley</PERSON> family 's story harrowing . 
" You 're always lookingfor redemption , " she says . 
" There is n't much in this story . 
" And interviewing <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> was , she discovered , uncomfortable . 
" I 'm not ajournalist , " says <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> . 
" I 'm not somebody who is used to hammering atpeople . 
I 'm perfectly comfortable vivisecting myself , but it 's an entirelydifferent thing to ask someone difficult questions again and again . " 
Harrisonfound she needed to repeatedly ask <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> for minute and painful detailsabout her family 's home life and the murders . 
" We would march over the sameterritory , " she says . 
" Partly because the story is so shocking and disturbing , Ihad to have it told again and again in order to internalize it , the same way yougo over anything disturbing . 
" As time went on , the process got easier , <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> says . 
" She trusted me more , and I trusted myself more . 
I knew there 'd be a time when I would ask a questionthat was painful -- actually , most of the time -- but they were n't questionsintended to inflict pain , " says <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> . 
" I was doing it in service of aproject we both believed in . 
" At first , <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> says , she had the " romantic idea " that <PERSON>Jody</PERSON> and <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> mightcome together through her book . 
Instead , <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> has become what she calls a " weird sort of liaison in that I have a relationship with the two of them andthey do n't have one with each other . " 
Arlington has not seen her brother in 24years , and has not had any contact with him in nearly 10 years -- nor does sheplan to . 
<PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> has continued to correspond with <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> since visiting him inprison.In <DATE>2006</DATE> and <DATE>2007</DATE> , <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> sent <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> four drafts of the book . 
" Every time adraft would land , I would dread having to read it , " <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> says . 
However , thelater drafts were progressively less upsetting to her , she says , and the endresult is a book she is satisfied with.But <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> 's telling is an account of the murder of the <PERSON>Gilley</PERSON> family , not thesurvivor 's tale <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> first decided to write back at <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> . 
And , afterwanting so badly to shed the burden , she now feels an even more powerful need towrite that tale . 
Even if she risks fracturing her carefully constructed life , <PERSON>Jody Arlington</PERSON> may still , one day , give voice to her own story.Laura <PERSON>Wexler</PERSON> , a <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> writer , is the author of Fire in a Canebrake : The <ORGANIZATION>LastMass Lynching</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> .
