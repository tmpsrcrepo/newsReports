A colleague forwarded me an e-mail the other week from a friend of a friend.What 's up with this ? 
he asked me.The e-mail was a chain letter about breast-cancer funding , sent from sender ' swork e-mail and then forwarded on to many other people 's work e-mail . 
At thebottom of the letter , the corporate legalese stated : This message contains information from [ insert unwitting company 's name here ] which may be confidential and privileged . 
If you are not an intended recipient , please refrain from any disclosure , copying , distribution or use of thisinformation and note that such actions are prohibited.Needless to say , the e-mail did not contain information from the company . 
And itwas disclosed , copied and distributed.We all receive chain e-mails from friends and family who often send totallynon-work-related e-mail from their work address . 
Often with a similar disclaimerat the bottom . 
Was this company allowing someone to forward a benign butobviously not work-related e-mail to more than two dozen people ? 
No . 
And theirrules stated so . 
But does it happen ? 
Every minute , every day.Every week employees receive up to 30 chain letters , jokes , video clips orsimilar junk e-mail messages from someone they know , according to a study bymarket research firm Market Facts . 
This means many American workers have to dealwith more than 1,500 pieces of junk e-mail each year just from friends , familyand colleagues.What does this mean for us ? 
Lost time at work . 
Lost productivity for us and ourcompany . 
And lots of extra hours for the tech folks who are already worryingabout how to stop the ever-growing amount of incoming spam . 
" We have to give employees rules to write by . 
Employees do n't understand therisks of e-mail , " said <PERSON>Nancy Flynn</PERSON> , executive director of the ePolicy <ORGANIZATION>Instituteand</ORGANIZATION> co-author of the book " E-Mail Rules . " 
" They do n't know what [ the company 's ] rules and policies and procedures are unless you put them in writing and educatethem about it . 
" Three-fourths of all companies put workplace e-mail policies in place not onlyto encourage employees to get back to work , but because a company can be heldliable for e-mails sent from its e-mail system.In fact , <PERCENT>27 percent</PERCENT> of Fortune 500 companies have defended themselves againstclaims of sexual harassment stemming from inappropriate e-mail or Internet use , according to the <ORGANIZATION>ePolicy Institute</ORGANIZATION> , a training and consulting firm that studiesInternet and e-mail usage . 
<ORGANIZATION>Chevron</ORGANIZATION> had to pay female employees <MONEY>$ 2.2 million</MONEY> tosettle a sexual-harassment lawsuit stemming from inappropriate e-mail sent bymale employees.But it 's not just the companies that can get in trouble.In <DATE>2003</DATE> , <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT> of employers reported they had terminated an employee forviolating e-mail rules , according to a <DATE>2003</DATE> e-mail survey from <ORGANIZATION>AmericanManagement Association</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>ePolicy Institute</ORGANIZATION> and Clearswift , which makessecurity software . 
That number has grown from just <PERCENT>14 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>2001</DATE> . 
Ofcourse , those who were terminated were probably not the people who sent ane-mail about breast-cancer funding , but more likely those who sent sexuallyoriented or harassing e-mails . 
Threatening termination or not , companies are starting to make sure employeesknow what the rules are , said <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> . 
Some companies allow employees a certainamount of time each day to send appropriate personal e-mails . 
Others will telltheir employees to tell friends to send them e-mail to a non-work account.Digging through e-mail takes up precious hours every day . 
Although there aremany spam-filter software programs out there , a lot of times those programsdo n't filter out the " Pass On a Prayer or You Will Have Bad Luck " e-mails youget from your <PERSON>Great-Aunt Edna</PERSON> . 
Which means that many workers not only have todeal with annoying commercial spammers , but also miscellaneous missives fromco-workers , friends and family . 
( The average employee spends <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> of theworkday on e-mail , with <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT> of workers devoting more than four hours a dayto e-mail , according to the survey . ) 
But many of us have come up with our ownsolutions in dealing with the friendly junk e-mail . 
" I just do n't open it , " said <PERSON>Brian Chavis</PERSON> , chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION>ARGroup Inc.</ORGANIZATION> , a computer network services company in <LOCATION>Leesburg</LOCATION> . 
If he sees something that hintsat a forwarded mass e-mail , he usually hits delete , no matter who it is from.His wife passes some chain-letter-type e-mails back and forth with friends . 
Buthe said she knows better than to send them his way . 
E-mail to him is justbusiness.Sometimes , when <PERSON>Chavis</PERSON> does receive a forwarded e-mail from someone he knows , itchanges his opinion of them . 
" Occasionally I 'll get one from somebody [ I was ] just convinced knew better , " he said . 
" If you get a hoax that people have n'tchecked out , they just appear to be very , very naive . 
" One woman said that when she receives the annoying hoax e-mail from theoccasional friend or colleague , she heads to www.urbanlegends.about.com , andreplies to everyone on the list with a link showing it was a hoax.The woman always adds a note : " This site is great because you can check out thevalidity of the e-mail before you send it . 
" Hint , hint . 
No , <ORGANIZATION>Neiman Marcus</ORGANIZATION> really did n't charge <MONEY>$ 200</MONEY> for that cookie recipe.Now get back to work.Join <PERSON>Amy Joyce</PERSON> from <TIME>11 a.m.</TIME> to noon <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at www.washingtonpost.com to discussyour life at work .
