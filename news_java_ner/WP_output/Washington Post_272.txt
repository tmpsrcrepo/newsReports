The big question going into <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> 's critical <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> gubernatorialdebate was whether Republican nominee <PERSON>Ken Cuccinelli</PERSON> could find a way to shakeup a contest in which Democrat <PERSON>Terry McAuliffe</PERSON> has claimed a modest butmeaningful lead.Cuccinelli failed to do so , and the back-and-forth in a <ORGANIZATION>Tysons Corner</ORGANIZATION> auditoriumillustrated two main reasons.First , the Republican 's long , well-documented record as a prominent crusader forreligious right and tea party causes has made it difficult for him to make acredible appeal to middle-of-the-road voters.As a result , <PERSON>McAuliffe</PERSON> was able to keep <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> on the defensive by citinghis past , controversial positions that the Republican would prefer to avoiddiscussing.The most prominent one on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> was <ORGANIZATION>Cuccinelli</ORGANIZATION> 's previous backing of aso-called personhood bill . 
The measure was designed , in part , to stop abortion , but many doctors think it would also prohibit some common forms of birthcontrol.Astonishingly , <LOCATION>Cuccinelli</LOCATION> , whose lack of support among women is killing hisstanding in the polls , did not challenge <PERSON>McAuliffe</PERSON> 's repeated contentions thathe wanted to outlaw contraception.Cuccinelli , the state 's attorney general , has said previously that he had nointention of trying to interfere with contraception - but he did n't repeat thatin the debate . 
I do n't think it helped him much with female voters when he said , " You may not always agree with me . . . but you 'll always know where I stand . 
" Then there is the second reason why <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> is having trouble clawing his wayback into the race . 
The gifts scandal in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> has undermined what shouldhave been one of his strongest arguments : that his opponent is ethicallychallenged.McAuliffe , a former <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> national chairman and world-classfundraiser , has a questionable record in both campaign fundraising and privatebusiness dealings.Cuccinelli highlighted this in one of his best lines of the night , saying thatwith <PERSON>McAuliffe</PERSON> in the governor 's mansion , the commonwealth would have to changeits motto from " sic semper tyrannis " ( " thus always to tyrants " ) to " quid proquo . 
" But <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> spent at least as much time in the debate trying to explain whyhe took <MONEY>$ 18,000</MONEY> in gifts from Star Scientific chief executive <PERSON>Jonnie WilliamsSr</PERSON> . 
as he did pounding <PERSON>McAuliffe</PERSON> over transgressions such as the current federalinvestigation of a " green car " company that the Democrat founded.Cuccinelli did not directly answer a pointed question from my <LOCATION>Washington Postcolleague Ben Pershing</LOCATION> as to why he thought <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> gave him the gifts . 
Heseemed to point the finger at Gov. <PERSON>Robert McDonnell</PERSON> ( R ) . 
" Ironically , I met Mr. <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> through the governor , " <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> said . 
" Whatwas going on there did n't seem like a big deal . 
" Cuccinelli did ring up points by calling out McAuliffe for being unaware that agovernor 's signature would not be required to amend the state 's constitution , ifthe <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> repealed the state 's ban on gay marriage.That reinforced a narrative promoted by the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON>McAuliffe</PERSON> does n't knowenough about <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> government to be an effective governor.But voters have known from the start that <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> had considerable experiencein state office , while <PERSON>McAuliffe</PERSON> has none . 
The Republican 's problem is therecord he 's built while accumulating all that experience , which McAuliffe triedto highlight during the debate.Since he received the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nomination in <DATE>May</DATE> , <PERSON>Cuccinelli</PERSON> has been trying to copyMcDonnell 's successful strategy from four years ago of playing down hisconservative stances on hot-button topics . 
Instead , he emphasizes jobs and hismore palatable social views.That approach was evident from <ORGANIZATION>Cuccinelli</ORGANIZATION> 's opening statement in the debate . 
Hereferred to his efforts over the years to stop sexual assaults and to help thehomeless and the mentally ill.But Cuccinelli had other priorities as attorney general . 
He used the office towage high-profile efforts , often unsuccessfully , for pet causes such as opposingObamacare , abortion , equal rights for gays , and environmental regulation.Given that , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> voters are right to be suspicious that he would act asgovernor just as he did as the state 's top lawman.Unless he can reverse that perception - or McAuliffe stumbles - Cuccinelli facesa tough path to win the governorship . 
In this potentially pivotal debate , thefirst to be broadcast statewide , nothing changed to make that trek significantlyeasier.robert.mccartney@washpost.comI discusss local issues at <TIME>8:50 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE> on <ORGANIZATION>WAMU</ORGANIZATION> ( 88.5 FM ) .
