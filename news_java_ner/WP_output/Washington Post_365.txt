ON HIS 18TH DAY OF FREEDOM , <PERSON>Michael Short</PERSON> awakened before dawn . 
In prison , corrections officers had paced the halls at night , jingling keys and shiningflashlights . 
Now <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> slept fitfully , even in a king-size bed.It was a damp , gray <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> late in <DATE>February</DATE> . 
He slipped on a pinstriped shirtthat hid his tattoos , slid his feet into shiny new loafers and rubbed coconutoil into his hair , cut razor-straight at the temples and flecked with gray . 
Hewas 36 , with a basketball player 's long-legged gait and the lined brow of a manwell acquainted with consequences . 
Standing in front of the bathroom mirror , henervously knotted a silver-and-white tie that his girlfriend had bought him atMacy 's . 
On days like this , he wished the past were a room with a door you could close , aplace you could walk away from , as he had walked away from prison afterPresident <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> commuted his sentence . 
But the past was n't like that , at leastnot for him . 
Over breakfast , he practiced the testimony he was scheduled todeliver that afternoon before a congressional subcommittee : My name is <LOCATION>MichaelShort</LOCATION> . 
I am here because in <DATE>1992</DATE> I was sentenced for selling crack cocaine.Before that , I had never spent a day in prison . 
I came from a good family . 
I hadno criminal history . 
I was not a violent offender . 
But I was sentenced to servenearly 20 years . 
I was 21 years old.As he navigated traffic from his girlfriend 's house in <LOCATION>Charles County</LOCATION> andboarded the subway to Capitol Hill , he braced himself for the inevitablequestions , the scrutiny of his crime , the dissection of his punishment . 
Hiscommutation had taken half a dozen years to materialize and , by <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> ' scalculation , had shaved only six months off the time he would have served . 
Hehad spent more years in prison than many murderers.He arrived at the basement room in the <ORGANIZATION>Rayburn House Office</ORGANIZATION> Building a half-hourearly and looked around , taking in the raised dais , the plaque that said " Waysand Means . " 
He might have spent this drizzly morning at the <LOCATION>Greenbelt</LOCATION> healthclub where he had recently landed a job as a personal trainer . 
Instead , he washere , wondering what was meant by the term " majority whip " and hoping that hewould n't stutter.The room slowly filled with the most sympathetic crowd he would encounter allday : lawyers , ex-prisoners and advocates who believed that federal crack cocainelaws were unfair and had gathered to lobby for new ones . 
The subcommitteehearing would not take place until afternoon ; this was just a practice sessionto give <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> and other lobbyists some last-minute pointers . 
Someone handed him abig red button that said , " CRACK the disparity , " a reference to the vastdifference in prison terms to which crack and powder cocaine offenders aresentenced . 
He pinned it to his shirt.Rep . 
<PERSON>Sheila Jackson Lee</PERSON> , a Democrat from <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> who has introduced a bill toremedy the disparity , walked to the lectern . 
An imposing woman in an emeraldgreen suit , she wondered aloud what <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's founders would have thought , hadthey been able to look into the future and see how many times the country fellshort of its ideals . 
" They set up these models , these principles , that indicated that we had theright of free speech , that we had the right of a trial by our peers , " <PERSON>JacksonLee</PERSON> said , her voice rising . 
" And for those of us [ whose forebears ] came here inthe bottom of the belly of a slave boat , the 13th and 14th and 15th amendmentssuggested that there was a road map to freedom in this nation . 
But we havesometimes lost our way . 
" She spoke of how , in the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> , no one stopped to help the beaten , stripped manon the roadside until the Good Samaritan came along . 
In much the same way , shesaid , members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> had long ignored broken crack cocaine laws thatdisproportionately affected African Americans . 
Husbands , brothers and sistershad disappeared from their communities for years over relatively minor drugcrimes , she said.Mike pulled a crumpled tissue from his pocket and wiped his eyes . 
The packedroom felt like church on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> . 
As <PERSON>Jackson Lee</PERSON> spoke , people yelled , " Yes ! " 
and " All right now ! " 
When she finished , <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> clapped long and hard.And then , unexpectedly , someone introduced him . 
He walked to the lectern andstood there , hunching his shoulders as if he were ashamed of his 6-foot-2-inchframe . 
His voice was gravelly with emotion.He began his spiel : his name , his crime -- the distribution of 63 grams of crackcocaine -- the almost-20-year sentence , the 15 years and eight months he 'd spentin prison . 
" How many ? " 
someone called out , incredulous . 
" Fifteen years and <DATE>eight months of my 19 years</DATE> , " <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> said . 
He paused , searchingfor a way to explain without asking for sympathy . 
He tried to maintain hiscomposure . 
" I made a mistake . 
And it did n't take me 15 years to understand that what I didwas wrong . 
I deserved to go to prison . 
But I do n't feel as though I deserved togo to prison for 15 years . 
" IN THE SUMMER OF <DATE>1986</DATE> , WHEN MIKE WAS 15 , the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Celtics</ORGANIZATION> selected Len Bias astheir first pick in the <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> draft . 
A Celtics scout compared him to MichaelJordan , and Bias told a reporter that the first thing he planned to buy was aMercedes . 
Two days later , he collapsed in his dorm suite at the <ORGANIZATION>University ofMaryland</ORGANIZATION> , dead of a cocaine overdose . 
The community that had cheered for himstaggered like a man punched in the gut . 
Here was a kid from Prince <PERSON>George</PERSON> ' sCounty who had laid claim to the American dream with all the ease of a proexecuting a layup . 
" I ca n't see why we would lose someone like this , " thedirector of a recreation center where Bias had played as a kid told <ORGANIZATION>TheWashington Post</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Someone so important to us . 
" Initial medical reports indicated , incorrectly , that the high concentration ofcocaine in Bias 's blood suggested that he had died after smoking crack , then thelatest drug to hit <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's city streets . 
Made from powder cocaine cooked withbaking soda , crack was cheaper than powder , and , because it was smoked , the highwas more intense.Living in <LOCATION>Hyattsville</LOCATION> , the son of a legal secretary and a car salesman , Mikeabsorbed the news , but he was too young to make sense of it . 
Drugs were not apart of his world . 
His parents had separated when he was a boy , and his motherraised him and his brother and sister in quiet suburban neighborhoods beforemoving to a neat brick house on <LOCATION>Hawaii Avenue</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Northeast Washington</LOCATION> after Mikegraduated from high school . 
He was a quiet kid , obsessed with basketball . 
Hisfriends called him a " mama 's boy " because he used to meet his mother at the busstop when she got home from work . 
" I would n't have known what cocaine was if youput it on my dinner plate , " he said.Nevertheless , his world reverberated with <PERSON>Len Bias</PERSON> 's loss . 
At <ORGANIZATION>Northwestern HighSchool</ORGANIZATION> , Bias 's alma mater , <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> played on the varsity basketball team with thestar 's younger brother <PERSON>Jay</PERSON> . 
Mike wanted to comfort <PERSON>Jay</PERSON> , who was visiblydistraught , but he did n't know what to say.In <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> , then-House Speaker <PERSON>Tip O'Neill</PERSON> , a Democrat whose Bostonconstituents could n't stop talking about Bias 's death , saw a politicalopportunity . 
Throughout the <DATE>1980s</DATE> , the federal government had waded deeper intothe war on drugs , part of a trend spawned by the turmoil of the <DATE>1960s</DATE> and <DATE>'70s</DATE> . 
Bias 's death offered a perfect chance to capitalize on the growing publicoutcry , especially over crack . 
" The speaker realizes , if the Democrats take thelead on this , if we play it right , maybe we can win the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> back , " <PERSON>Eric E.Sterling</PERSON> said recently . 
He was assistant counsel to the <ORGANIZATION>House Judiciarysubcommittee</ORGANIZATION> on crime in <DATE>1986</DATE> and now heads the <ORGANIZATION>Criminal Justice PolicyFoundation</ORGANIZATION> , a Silver Spring nonprofit that educates the public about criminaljustice issues.O ' <PERSON>Neill</PERSON> convened the steering and policy committee of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Democrats andmoved the formation of tougher drug laws to the top of the agenda . 
Sterling andother staffers were told to draft a law that would punish high-leveltraffickers , but they did n't know what amount of drugs would qualify someone as " high-level " and , with the midterm election campaign season just a few daysaway , they did n't have time to determine that , <PERSON>Sterling</PERSON> said . 
No hearings wereheld.The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of <DATE>1986</DATE> established the mandatory minimum drug sentencesthat remain in effect today . 
It imposed a five-year mandatory prison term forfirst-time trafficking of five or more grams of crack or 500 grams of powder , and a 10-year mandatory minimum for first-time trafficking of 50 grams of crackor five kilos of powder . 
In drug policy circles , this is known as the " 100-to-1drug quantity ratio , " and it has hit African Americans hardest because they aremore likely to live in the neighborhoods where crack cocaine is used and sold , even though , in absolute numbers , most crack users are white . 
In <DATE>2006</DATE> , 82percent of crack offenders sentenced under federal law were African American , according to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Sentencing Commission</ORGANIZATION> , an independent agency set up todevelop a national sentencing policy for the federal courts.In <DATE>1988</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> got even tougher , passing a law that made simple possession offive grams of crack punishable by a mandatory minimum five-year prison term.First-time possession of any amount of any other controlled substance , includingpowder cocaine , is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of a year in prison.The only exception is flunitrazepan , also known as Rohypnol , the " date rapedrug , " which carries a maximum three-year penalty for first-time possession.Five basic suppositions guided lawmakers in setting such high penalties forcrack , according to research by the Sentencing Commission.Crack is extremely addictive , and because crack users needed to get high morefrequently and tended to have less money than powder users , they were morelikely to engage in criminal behavior to support their addictions , creating atleast a perceived link between crack use and violence . 
Crack was consideredespecially dangerous , particularly to fetuses . 
Children were also used aslookouts by dealers and exposed to the drug as addicts . 
And crack 's potency andlow price -- about <MONEY>$ 10</MONEY> for two small pieces compared with <MONEY>$ 100</MONEY> for a gram ofpowder cocaine in <DATE>1986</DATE> -- meant that almost anyone could afford it.President <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> signed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act in late <DATE>October 1986</DATE> . 
Thefollowing week , the Democrats took back the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> . 
Over the next two decades , the federal prison population would grow from about 38,000 to more than 200,000 ; more than half the current inmates are drug offenders . 
The average amount ofcrack that federal offenders were convicted of trafficking in <DATE>2006</DATE> was 51 grams , about the weight of a candy bar ; their average prison sentence was 10 years , according to the <ORGANIZATION>Sentencing Commission</ORGANIZATION> . 
" If we were sophisticated in the metric system , we would have known that thepeople we 're interested in , like [ Colombian Pablo ] <PERSON>Escobar</PERSON> , are moving a ton , amillion grams , " Sterling said . 
" Are we winning the war on drugs ? 
No . 
The federalgovernment is wasting the resources . 
" THE YEAR AFTER LEN BIAS DIED , <PERSON>Mike Short</PERSON> 's team at <ORGANIZATION>Northwestern</ORGANIZATION> won the statechampionship . 
He and his teammates stormed the court at the <ORGANIZATION>University ofMaryland</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Cole Field House</ORGANIZATION> in jubilation , and some leapt for the rim and heldon , shattering a fiberglass backboard . 
Their joy signaled intense relief . 
It hadbeen a tough season , with rival players mocking <PERSON>Jay Bias</PERSON> over his brother ' sdrug-induced death and <ORGANIZATION>Northwestern</ORGANIZATION> players fighting back . 
Several had beensuspended.Mike , a sophmore , was n't among them , but in his senior year he was cut from theteam over " differences of opinion " with a new coach , he said . 
His mother metwith teachers and administrators , who offered to reinstate him , but Mikerefused . 
" It 's my fault for being angry like that , holding resentment , " he said . 
" That 's something that still haunts me . 
" He switched to pickup games on street courts in suburban <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> , where drugdealers and athletes mingled like mismatched dancing partners . 
Dealers wouldsometimes hand out money to winning players or buy them clothes . 
People noticedMike 's skill and started paying him as much as <MONEY>$ 500</MONEY> to play in high-stakesgames , he said . 
He knew drugs were illegal , and his training as an athletedissuaded him from using them . 
He says he never tried cocaine and only smokedmarijuana once . 
He did n't need money . 
" But then some of us would see how easy itis , and it 's hard to turn down <MONEY>$ 1,000</MONEY> or <MONEY>$ 2,000</MONEY> when you do n't have to doanything , " he said.His dealing began with casual conversations with people from school , theneighborhood and guys he met on the courts . 
He was n't asked to do much -- mostof the time , he just made a phone call or delivered a package , often to peoplehe knew and trusted -- and dealing became part of the fabric of his social life.He would go bowling and meet someone else in the business , or arrange a handoffto a friend at a local barbershop . 
He bought himself stylish new clothes , but hedid n't buy a car because he worried that his mother , <PERSON>Shirley Short</PERSON> , would catchon . 
Even so , when he showed up in a pair of <MONEY>$ 100</MONEY> tennis shoes that she had n'tbought for him , when his friends parked their own flashy cars outside , sheguessed the truth . 
About a year before <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> got arrested , his mother told him tostop . 
He did n't see why he should . 
" I was like , Man , it 's just too sweet of a deal , " he recalled . 
" There 's noviolence involved . 
Why not sell it , make my <MONEY>$ 500</MONEY> , and go on about my business ? 
" The violence that was invisible to him was apparent to anyone who read thenewspaper or had the misfortune to live in one of the impoverished urbanneighborhoods favored by street dealers . 
In <DATE>1989</DATE> , <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> had 434 homicides , more per capita than any other <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> city . 
But <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> did n't frequent open-air drugmarkets , and he told himself that the cops were n't looking for someone like him.I 'm a peon , he thought . 
They want the guys who are selling thousands andthousands of dollars ' worth.And then he walked into their cross hairs.The investigation that put him in prison , like the law that kept him there , began with Bias 's death . 
In <DATE>1987</DATE> , <PERSON>Brian Tribble</PERSON> , a former <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> student andfriend of Bias 's , went on trial for supplying the cocaine that killed thebasketball star . 
A former player testified that he and three others , includingTribble and Bias , snorted about one-third of a cup of powder cocaine the nightthey were celebrating Bias 's ascension to the Celtics.Relying heavily on the testimony of former teammates who snorted cocaine withBias and a 17-year-old with an extensive juvenile record who said he had soldlarge amounts of cocaine for <ORGANIZATION>Tribble</ORGANIZATION> , prosecutors built a case that they lateracknowledged was largely circumstantial . 
Tribble was acquitted , the jury foremanexplained after the trial , because prosecutors failed to present evidence beyonda reasonable doubt that he had any connection to the drugs that killed Bias.Tribble wept when the verdict was read , but his success in beating the chargesvaulted him to superstardom in the local drug-dealing community , said <PERSON>J. AndrewMcColl</PERSON> , the lead <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent on the investigation that led to <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> 's arrest . 
" <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> was Mr. <PERSON>Teflon</PERSON> , " <PERSON>McColl</PERSON> said . 
" Nobody could touch him . 
" In <DATE>1988</DATE> , the <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> police and the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> went after <PERSON>Tribble</PERSON> , who was working with anetwork of dealers in the <LOCATION>Woodridge</LOCATION> neighborhood in <LOCATION>Northeast</LOCATION> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> plannedto have undercover agents supply the dealers with cellphones in exchange forcrack cocaine and to record their conversations . 
At the time , cellphones wererare and expensive ; you needed good credit to get one , something most drugdealers did n't have.A few days before <DATE>Christmas</DATE> in <DATE>1989</DATE> , an undercover <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent showed up tocollect a monthly cellphone payment in crack from a dealer named <PERSON>Norman Brown.Brown</PERSON> told the agent to drive over to his " man " and collect the drugs . 
On thisday , his man was <PERSON>Mike Short</PERSON> . 
Mike handed the agent a paper bag containing 63grams of crack cocaine . 
The agent gave him <MONEY>$ 1,800</MONEY> . 
In <DATE>1990</DATE> , after a two-year investigation , federal authorities charged <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> , then19 , and 28 others with selling powder cocaine and crack as part of a sprawlingdrug ring . 
<DATE>Nearly two decades later</DATE> , <PERSON>McColl</PERSON> called <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> " a very minor player . 
" <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> said he had never been suspended from school . 
Unlike some of hiscodefendants , he had worked steadily , including helping his father at <ORGANIZATION>MattressDiscounters</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Langley Park.Meanwhile</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Brian Tribble</PERSON> agreed to cooperate with authorities in exchange for areduced sentence . 
He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute powder cocaine , admitting that he and associates had sold more than 110 pounds of drugs in an18-month period . 
He was sentenced to 10 years , almost exactly half the length ofMike 's crack sentence of 19 years and seven months . 
In addition to the 63 gramsMike handed to the undercover agent , the court held him accountable for helpingto distribute another five kilos of crack , based on witness testimony , whichadded considerably to his sentence.AFTER HE WAS FREED , MIKE RETURNED TO <LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> ON THE NIGHT OF <DATE>DECEMBER 18,2007</DATE> , on a Trailways bus from <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> , wearing a prison-issue sweat suitand a denim jacket that whipped in the wind . 
He had ridden since morning , staring out the window , too anxious to sleep . 
He felt like everyone was lookingat him , like they all knew that he had just been released from prison.He was released just ahead of a stream of crack offenders expected to get out anaverage of two years early under changes enacted last fall by the SentencingCommission . 
About 20,000 federal crack inmates will be eligible for thereductions over the next 30 years . 
The largest number -- about 1,400 -- weresentenced in the <LOCATION>Eastern District of Virginia</LOCATION> ; 279 were sentenced in Marylandand 269 in the District.On average , they are male , black and 35 years old , a profile that <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> fitalmost exactly , and many will return to neighborhoods scarred by drugs . 
TheAnacostia halfway house where <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> would spend the next six weeks sat acrossfrom a rundown apartment complex on a desolate street . 
It was called HopeVillage , but he quickly sized up the neighborhood . 
" You would find your choiceof drugs around there , easy , " he said.He had been behind bars for nearly 16 years , most of it in <LOCATION>Petersburg</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va</LOCATION> . 
Hismother had died in <DATE>1997</DATE> , and he had gone to her funeral in his khaki inmate ' suniform , chained at the waist and ankles , escorted by corrections officers.Mike 's father , whom he had seen periodically over the years , also attended thefuneral , along with <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> 's brother , sister and nephews . 
His father sometimesvisited him in prison , and the two developed a closer relationship , though theywere never as close as he and his mother had been.At first , he was angry -- at the people who 'd testified against him , at thegovernment and at his lawyer . 
Having never been much of a churchgoer , he blamedGod . 
Then somewhere along the way , he grew tired of the repetitive drone of hisown rage . 
" I did n't want to come out of prison being bitter , hating anyone , " hesaid . 
" I was n't raised like that , and I did n't want to come home like that . 
" Vowing not to waste a day , he earned an associate 's degree in businessmanagement and worked long hours in a prison business office . 
" Why did you go to prison for so long ? " 
<PERSON>Mike</PERSON> recalls his nephew asking when hevisited . 
" Did you kill anybody ? " 
" I sold drugs , " <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> told him . 
" But you have n't been home since I been living . " 
After a while , he stoppedasking.Another visitor began making the 2 1/2 - hour trip from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to see him , first with <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> 's sister , then on her own . 
<PERSON>Vanessa Bolden</PERSON> was 5-foot-2 , withsmooth chestnut skin and the righteous toughness of a woman who had been workingsince she was 16 and now owned her home and drove a sleek blue Lexus . 
She andMike had started dating a few months before he was convicted , but neitherthought it would last . 
She was a 31-year-old single mother with her ownapartment and a job at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Customs Service</ORGANIZATION> . 
He was 21 , living with hismother and going to federal court every day for his trial on drug charges.Vanessa and <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> would go to <PERSON>Hains</PERSON> Point or <ORGANIZATION>Rock Creek Park</ORGANIZATION> and drink Heinekensand talk . 
Sometimes they would sit in her car in front of his mother 's house , listening to the radio and laughing . 
If he was nervous about going to prison , she never guessed . 
" I never had no idea that they would give him 1,001 years , " she said.In the prison visiting room , she was impressed by what she saw . 
" He startededucating himself ; he started reading a lot , getting a lot of knowledge , " shesaid . 
After receiving his management degree , <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> earned his personal trainercertification and completed courses in nutrition and plyometric training.Vanessa and <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> exchanged letters and talked on the phone . 
Their relationshipbegan to shape <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> 's life . 
She watched her girlfriends fall prey to cheatingmen . 
She would hang out with her brothers or go to a happy hour , but shewould n't let a man buy her a drink . 
Mike was her excuse . 
When she went out , sheimagined he was at the table next to her . 
" I always thought <PERSON>Mikey</PERSON> was watchingme , " she said.By the time his release date neared , she was going to see him nearly everyweekend , getting up at <TIME>5 a.m.</TIME> on <DATE>Sundays</DATE> and driving all morning to sit next tohim in the crowded visiting room and hold his hand . 
" I was like , ' What is wrongwith me ? ' 
? " 
she said . 
They talked for hours about their families , their future.When <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> woke up troubled in the middle of the night , she would write tohim . 
" He 'd write me back and make me feel better . 
I was like , Damn , if it wasthat simple , why could n't I figure it out ? 
" In <DATE>2002</DATE> , he applied for executive clemency , which is one of the few remediesavailable to federal prisoners sentenced to mandatory minimums because there isno parole in the federal system . 
A year earlier , President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> hadhanded out dozens of last-minute pardons and commutations . 
One of the recipientswas <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> 's codefendant and childhood friend <PERSON>Derrick Curry</PERSON> . 
In recentadministrations , clemency has become rare . 
Bush has approved only sixcommutations since taking office , fewer than any president except his father , who served only one term.Mike 's petition , including letters from prison officials , his sister and familyfriends , landed in the Office of the Pardon Attorney in early <DATE>2002</DATE> . 
It wouldtake more than five years to reach the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> , just three blocks away . 
Atfirst , his request seemed headed for denial , according to documents . 
Three yearspassed before then-Pardon Attorney <PERSON>Roger Adams</PERSON> sent a letter to the U.S.attorney in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> and to Judge <PERSON>William Nickerson</PERSON> , who had presided overMike 's case , asking them to weigh in on his clemency petition.A veteran judge , <PERSON>Nickerson</PERSON> had long been frustrated by the sentencing guidelinesthat took discretion out of the hands of judges . 
<PERSON>Mike</PERSON> 's case had bothered himfor years , so much so that it contributed to his decision to stop handling drugcases . 
<PERSON>Mike</PERSON> and his codefendants were kids from hard-working families who " kind of got sidetracked , " <PERSON>Nickerson</PERSON> said . 
" It made itdoubly tragic to ship them off to jail . " 
When it came time in <DATE>2005</DATE> to offer anopinion on <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> 's clemency petition , <PERSON>Nickerson</PERSON> endorsed it.Two years later , on <DATE>December 11 , 2007</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> announced thecommutation . 
It had been so long that <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> had forgotten he had applied . 
Hisunit manager found him eating lunch in the prison cafeteria . 
" Are you <PERSON>Michael Short</PERSON> ? " 
he asked . 
" Why ? " 
Mike barked . 
He assumed he was in trouble , though he knew he had donenothing wrong . 
" Relax , " the unit manager told him . 
" You got immediate release . 
" <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> 's face broke into a smile . 
" Oh , really ? 
Can I leave right now ? 
" When <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> learned that he was coming home early , she found herself trembling . 
" I did n't know what kind of man he really was , as far as living with him , " shesaid.The night he arrived , he climbed into her car . 
They sat side by side , just thetwo of them in silence . 
She glanced over at him , wondering if this was for real.WHEN HE GOT OUT OF THE HALFWAY HOUSE THIS PAST <DATE>FEBRUARY</DATE> , <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> moved intoVanessa 's three-bedroom house in <LOCATION>Charles County</LOCATION> . 
Golden cherubs hung on thewalls in the bathroom , and a stuffed anteater with a pink ribbon around its neckoccupied the overstuffed living room couch . 
After the constant noise of men andcells , <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> 's house was quiet and strange . 
<PERSON>Mike</PERSON> did n't like being alonethere . 
After so long in prison , he felt awkward most places . 
At the mall , hestumbled when getting on escalators . 
Electronic gas pumps bewildered him.Vanessa rolled down her window to help : " Baby , push that button over there . 
" He and the other inmates had fantasized about running the streets when they gotout , but <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> found that he did n't even want to leave the house . 
He and Vanessatalked on the phone a dozen times a day . 
On <DATE>Valentine 's Day</DATE> , he made steak andshrimp fried rice and laid roses on their bed . 
He cooked her breakfast andpacked her lunch -- a ham-and-cheese sandwich , a granola bar , a peach . 
He moppedand vacuumed , washed clothes and painted the laundry room.In his last years in prison , they had almost broken up when he told her hewanted children . 
She was in her late 40s and had already raised a son . 
" I 'm notstopping you , " she told him then . 
" But , if you want to do it , then go do it . 
Ica n't be a part . " 
When she stopped answering his calls , he repented . 
" I want todo the right thing , " he said . 
" I want to make her happy . 
" Now she called him " my blessing , " " my heart . " 
He said she was his perfect soulmate . 
They went to a jewelry store to look at rings and cuddled in the kitchen , sipping Sutter Home rosÃ © while their dinner warmed in the oven . 
" He is not theaverage guy , 'cause the average guy 's not cooking all that for you , " she said.Mike ordered business cards and printed his rÃ © sumÃ © , which listed hisassociate 's degree , training and nutrition certificates , as well as his workexperience in prison . 
He applied for jobs at several big health clubs , handingover copies of his commutation bearing the president 's signature . 
When one ofthe gyms turned <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> down , a supervisor who believed in second chances put in agood word for him . 
Two weeks later , <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> got the job.He wanted to work <DATE>seven days a week</DATE> . 
" I have the energy and the motivation forit right now , " he said , " and I need the money . 
" He said nothing to his co-workers and clients about his past , but one day , during a training session , a client asked if he had been in prison . 
" I knew it , I knew it , " she said when he told her . 
She was a corrections officer . 
Mike ' sbiceps , swelled from years lifting weights in a prison gym , had given him away.ON THAT DAMP , GRAY TUESDAY IN <DATE>FEBRUARY</DATE> , <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> stood amid the marble columns ofthe <LOCATION>Capitol Rotunda</LOCATION> and dialed <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> 's number on his cellphone . 
He had spentthe morning meeting with a congressman and walking beneath crystal chandeliersand elaborate archways , past a portrait of <PERSON>Joseph Hayne Rainey</PERSON> , the firstAfrican American elected to the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> . 
Mike had grown up afew miles from the Capitol , but he had never been there . 
Now he told <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> howbeautiful it was.Shortly after <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> left the halfway house , an advocate from <ORGANIZATION>Families AgainstMandatory Minimums</ORGANIZATION> , a group that lobbies for fair and proportionate sentencing , asked for his help . 
Members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> had proposed a handful of bills toreduce or remove the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine , andFAMM wanted <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> to tell his story on the Hill.He was working long days at the health club , and he could n't afford a suit towear to the hearing , but felt he owed it to the men he had left behind inprison . 
By now , even some legislators who had voted for the <DATE>1986</DATE> mandatoryminimum laws expressed regret . 
One former supporter , Sen. <PERSON>Joseph Biden</PERSON> , aDemocrat from <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> , had recently told the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> thatthe sentencing disparity could not be justified : " Our intentions were good , butmuch of our information turns out not to be as good as our intentions . 
" It is true , medical experts say , that crack is more addictive than powdercocaine ; smoking and injecting offer quicker routes to the bloodstream thansnorting , and the faster , more intense highs lead to an increased rate ofaddiction . 
But statistics have not borne out fears of widespread violenceassociated with crack . 
In <DATE>2005</DATE> , only <PERCENT>6 percent</PERCENT> of powder cocaine offenses and 10percent of crack offenses involved violence or a threat of violence , accordingto the <ORGANIZATION>Sentencing Commission</ORGANIZATION> . 
The predicted " crack babies " did not materialize , either . 
Although some early studies of individual children suggested that crackhad devastating effects on fetuses , long-term case studies showed that alcoholis more dangerous to a fetus than any form of cocaine , including crack , and hasaffected a far greater number of children , said <PERSON>Harolyn Belcher</PERSON> , aneuro-developmental pediatrician and director of research at the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy KriegerInstitute 's Family Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> . 
" This was one of the few times when [ <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> ] really rushed to complete andformulate the sentencing before the science was really there , " <PERSON>Belcher</PERSON> said.Over the years , some lawmakers had tried to lessen crack penalties , but thepolitical moment had never been right . 
Then , last <DATE>fall</DATE> , the wind seemed to beshifting . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Sentencing Commission</ORGANIZATION> , which had long criticized the disparity , proposed the guideline changes that made thousands of crack offenders eligiblefor reduced sentences . 
<ORGANIZATION>Two Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> rulings allowed federal judges ameasure of freedom in drug sentencing , permitting them to exercise greaterleniency if they felt the circumstances demanded it . 
And amid it all , <PERSON>Bushcommuted Mike</PERSON> 's sentence.After the morning practice session and lunch in a congressional cafeteria , Mikeentered the hearing room , calming his nerves and distracting himself from whatwas coming by replaying in his head a basketball game he had seen recently onTV . 
The cameras from C-SPAN swiveled toward him and the other witnesses seatedat a long table planted with microphones . 
<PERSON>Mike</PERSON> was the only one without a lawdegree.Rep . 
<PERSON>Bobby Scott</PERSON> , a <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Democrat who chairs the <ORGANIZATION>House Judiciarysubcommittee</ORGANIZATION> on crime , terrorism and homeland security , banged the gavel . 
He hadproposed a bill to close the disparity , and he urged members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> to helpend " two decades of legal discrimination . " 
" There is certainly no sound basis for a five-year mandatory minimum sentencefor the mere possession of five grams of crack , when you could get probation forpossessing a ton of powder , " <PERSON>Scott said.Judge Ricardo Hinojosa</PERSON> , chair of the <ORGANIZATION>Sentencing Commission</ORGANIZATION> , ran down thestatistics . 
In <DATE>2007</DATE> , he said , crack sentences were about <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> longer thanpowder sentences . 
" The commission believes there is no justification for thecurrent statutory penalty scheme for powder and crack cocaine offenses , " hesaid.In the weeks before the hearing , Attorney General <PERSON>Michael Mukasey</PERSON> had spokenforcefully against the <ORGANIZATION>Sentencing Commission</ORGANIZATION> 's decision to make the guidelinechanges retroactive , saying that " nearly 1,600 convicted crack dealers , many ofthem violent gang members , will be eligible for immediate release intocommunities nationwide . " 
<PERSON>Gretchen Shappert</PERSON> , <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> attorney for the WesternDistrict of <LOCATION>North Carolina</LOCATION> , had come to present the <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> ' sposition.She said that her career had been " defined by the ravages of crack cocaine . " 
Shespoke about open-air drug markets , people sleeping in bathtubs to avoid straybullets , dealers recruiting kids to sell drugs . 
" We continue to believe that avariety of factors fully justify higher penalties for crack offenses , " Shappertsaid . 
" It has been said , and certainly it has been my experience , that whereaspowder cocaine destroys an individual , crack cocaine destroys a community . 
" <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> listened , the muscles in his forehead tightening . 
He sipped his water . 
Whenit was his turn to speak , his voice was low and scratchy . 
" To be clear , I knowthat what I did was wrong , " he read from his prepared testimony . 
" I sold illegaldrugs , and I deserved to be punished . 
But what I did and who I was did notjustify the sentence I received . . . " I have heard some of the comments some people in positions of power have madeabout crack cocaine prisoners -- that we are violent gang members and that thisis why our sentences have to be so much longer . 
I am not that person , and mostof the people that I leave behind in prison are n't , either . 
" When the testimony was over , <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> asked whether it was true that many offenderseligible for reduced sentences were already nearing the end of their prisonterms . 
" Many of them , that would be the case . 
Mr. <PERSON>Short</PERSON> 's situation is not unique , " said <PERSON>Reggie B. Walton</PERSON> , a federal judge in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> who was seated a few chairsdown from <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> . 
" And I think it 's just a waste of the taxpayers ' money to keepsomebody like Mr. <PERSON>Short</PERSON> locked up for as long as he was locked up . 
I 'll be thefirst to tell him that he should have been punished . 
But to keep somebody lockedup for as long as we kept him locked up , who could have come back into thecommunity and been a positive contributor to society , I think is a loss to thecommunity where he comes from . 
" People in the audience began to clap , and then , like a dam breaking , Mikehunched his shoulders and burst into tears.MIKE STOOD BEHIND THE COUNTER at the health club in <LOCATION>Greenbelt</LOCATION> . 
It was a <DATE>MarchSaturday</DATE> , one of the busiest days of the week , and he was the only one there.This was his chance to score new clients and build experience , and he had beenlooking forward to it.A woman approached him . 
She told him she wanted a personal trainer , but only ifhe could promise her that she would lose 20 pounds by <DATE>May</DATE> . 
In prison , <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> hadbecome something of a moral hardliner . 
He knew some trainers who would havetaken her money and told her what she wanted to hear , but he was n't one of them . 
" First and foremost , I 'm not going to promise you nothing , " he says he told her.It would depend on how disciplined she was during her workouts , he explained , and what she ate when she was n't at the gym . 
" Well , how much is it per hour ? 
" The sessions were priced in packages , not by the hour . 
He looked for acalculator . 
" You ought to know that ! " 
" Miss , I do n't work in sales . 
I 'm a personal trainer . " 
" Well , I want to talk to somebody else . " 
" You are free to talk to whoever you want to talk to . 
" She turned and stormed out , <PERSON>Mike said.When</PERSON> he walked out to the parking lot at the end of his shift , <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> thought , Ido n't need any more days like this . 
But the truth was , apart from computerglitches and the occasional cranky client , <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> loved being a personal trainer.The main problem was money . 
He had hoped to make from <MONEY>$ 12,000</MONEY> to <MONEY>$ 18,000</MONEY> in hisfirst six months of freedom , and he was nowhere close . 
He was paid <MONEY>$ 15</MONEY> for eachhour-long training session , but the club took nearly three times that much . 
" It 's robbery , " he said . 
" You getting paid peanuts for doing all the work . 
" His first paycheck had been for <MONEY>$ 17</MONEY> , but recently his biweekly pay had risen to <MONEY>$ 266</MONEY> . 
He quickly spent it on gas , an oil change , fixing a punctured tire andpaying his and <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> 's cellphone bills . 
He had planned to take over theirshared bills one by one , paying them in ascending order until they were sharingcosts equally . 
But on this day he had <MONEY>$ 15</MONEY> in his bank account.His framed training certificates still hung on the wall in the downstairs recroom , but he felt his dream slipping away . 
Vanessa paid every time they wentout . 
He tried to make up for it by cooking and cleaning , but he had his pride . 
" It 's got to be something better than this , " he said.One morning in <DATE>March</DATE> , he did n't get up to make Vanessa breakfast or pack herlunch . 
" I 'm tired , " he told her . 
He rolled over and slept until after she hadleft for work . 
A little later , frustrated and near tears , he sat at thecomputer , searching the Internet for openings at <ORGANIZATION>Safeway</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Giant</ORGANIZATION> , FedEx and thepost office . 
" I just got to be patient , " he told himself , his voice breaking.That afternoon , he was washing dishes in the kitchen when <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> called to saythat she would be home soon , and she was starving . 
She asked him to put somesalmon in the oven , and maybe make some rice . 
" What kind of rice you want me to make , <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> ? " 
he asked . 
" Baby , when you talk like that , I know you do n't want to do it . 
" <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> laughed . 
" You trying to read me through the phone now ? " 
He took the fishout of the refrigerator . 
" Get to cooking , man . 
I 'm hungry . " 
" Relax already . 
I got you . 
" A few minutes later , she called back . 
" Do you miss me ? " 
" Only on <DATE>Thursdays</DATE> and <DATE>Saturdays</DATE> . 
I do n't miss you today . " 
" All right , do n't forget you have to heat the oven up first and then let thatfresh salmon cook for 30 minutes . 
" <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> had already put the fish into the oven . 
" Are you going to let a true playerdo this , or what ? 
Please ! 
" He had learned to cook and clean from his mother . 
She assigned him and hissiblings chores , but because <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> was an early riser , he often ended up doinghis brother and sister 's chores as well , he said . 
In <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> 's house , he wouldturn on the music and lose himself in the repetitive strokes of a mop on a tilefloor . 
Cooking also relaxed him.He had been playful on the phone , but after he hung up , his mood darkened . 
Hetook down a box of cornbread mix and buttered a pan . 
He wore long nylon shorts , a sleeveless T-shirt and black slippers . 
He seemed too big for the room , withits cloth lilies in a pot by the sink . 
" I do n't normally curse , " he said . 
" I know I [ expletive ] up . 
I should have neverwent to prison . . . I know that this is not where I should be at this point inmy life , 36 years old , struggling . 
I should n't . 
" He was making his mother 's macaroni and cheese . 
He poured the pasta into abuttered pan , shook on black pepper , laid on slices of cheese and poured milkand eggs over the top.Outside , the neutral-colored houses with their slate blue and burgundy shuttersstood quiet in the middle of the day , their numbered parking spaces empty . 
Heand <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> were going out <TIME>that night</TIME> , and he had n't found another job . 
" BeforeI know it , I 'll have to go back to work tomorrow . " 
He sighed . 
" I did n't evenreally do nothing . 
" MIKE 'S CONCERNS ABOUT MONEY SEEMED BLISSFULLY REMOTE as he climbed a flight ofstairs at the <ORGANIZATION>Verizon Center</ORGANIZATION> one <DATE>Saturday</DATE> in <DATE>March</DATE> and settled into thesecond-to-last row to watch <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> play <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> basketballtournament . 
He had dreamed of going to an <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> game since he was a kid , and nowhis friend and codefendant <PERSON>Derrick Curry</PERSON> , who also had been freed bypresidential decree , sat beside him.Derrick wore a gray sweat suit and ate fried chicken off a cardboard tray , andMike leaned forward expectantly as they waited for the game to begin.Mike had been a Duke fan since he was 13 . 
He despised <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> . 
He hadspent the last year of his prison sentence in the state , which had noprofessional team , and corrections officers cheered raucously for their collegeplayers . 
" I hope we beat them by 50 , " he said.West <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> dominated from the start . 
A <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> player sped down the courtheading for the hoop and missed . 
" He ca n't shoot , " <PERSON>Derrick</PERSON> said . 
" He ca n't shoot , " <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> agreed . 
" A wide-open shot there ! 
No guard . 
He 's supposedto make that . 
" <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> leaned forward , hands crossed at the wrists , palms on his knees . 
As peopleshuffled past with trays of pretzels and kettle corn , <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> scoredagain . 
Mike shook his head . 
A <ORGANIZATION>Duke</ORGANIZATION> player dribbled the length of the court , roseto the basket and fumbled the shot . 
" Please , man ! " 
Mike yelled . 
" I do n'tunderstand ! 
That 's unreal , man ! 
" The game went on , but <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> furrowed his brow . 
If anyone understood theconsequences of a missed opportunity , it was him . 
As he and <PERSON>Derrick</PERSON> sat in theVerizon Center , <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> was considering seven bills that would reduce or removethe sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine , but other issues tookpriority : the teetering economy , the presidential race , Gen. <PERSON>David Petraeustalking</PERSON> about the effects of the troop surge in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> . 
It was , and still is , hardto know when or whether anything would change.When the clock ran out , <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> had upset Duke , 73-67 , in the day 's firstgame . 
Mike had been paid on <DATE>Friday</DATE> , but he rolled his eyes as he handed over <MONEY>$ 5for</MONEY> an ice cream . 
On the way back to his seat , an usher eyed his cone . 
" It ' sgood , " he told her , " but it cost too much . " 
As Purdue and <PERSON>Xavier</PERSON> chased eachother in the second game , <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> and <PERSON>Derrick</PERSON> sat as silent as boys absorbed intheir ice cream , biting into the cones wrapped in paper sleeves decorated withstars and stripes.THE SKY WAS STILL DARK WHEN MIKE LOCKED THE DOOR of <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> 's house behind him.He wore black pants and a long-sleeved white shirt and lugged a large gym bagand a gallon jug of water . 
In the burgundy <ORGANIZATION>Nissan</ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON>Vanessa</PERSON> had lent him , henavigated the streets at a crawl , flashing his turn signals even though theneighborhood was deserted . 
The prospect of a routine traffic stop filled himwith dread . 
Given his record , he worried that even a minor violation might endwith him face down on the asphalt surrounded by dogs.It was just after <TIME>4 a.m.</TIME> , and a thin crescent moon hung overhead . 
Mike likedthis time of day , before the sun rose and rush-hour traffic clogged thehighways . 
The soul classic " Natural High " played on the radio , and he leanedback in his seat and stared out at the dark road.He was on his way to a new job that promised everything he 'd hoped for when heleft prison . 
A week earlier , he had quit his job at the health club . 
His newemployer , <ORGANIZATION>Getem Tight Fitness</ORGANIZATION> , rented a mirrored ground-floor studio in anexpansive home in a Prince <PERSON>George</PERSON> 's County subdivision of mansions andlandscaped lawns.Mike was making <MONEY>$ 25</MONEY> an hour to train a small but dedicated clientele , almosttwice the rate of his previous job . 
For once , his past had not hurt him . 
Thegym 's manager , <PERSON>Richard Gartmon</PERSON> , had spent 10 years in prison on federal moneylaundering and fraud charges . 
He and <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> had met years earlier in prison , andMike got the job right away.The streets were silent as he pulled into an empty cul-de-sac and switched offthe engine . 
A few minutes later , another trainer parked beside him . 
Mike liftedhis bag and water jug from the trunk and followed her down a brick walkwaybehind a nearby house.Inside , he greeted his first clients , a handful of smiling , middle-aged women inblack workout suits . 
Red and green mats went down on the wood floors , and theiPod speakers blared <PERSON>Gwen Stefani</PERSON> . 
Mike changed into a shiny new <ORGANIZATION>Adidas</ORGANIZATION> shirtand pants that <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> had given him and stood at the front of the room to leadthe day 's first exercise class . 
" Feet together , hands together , rotate to the right first , " he called , spinninghis torso . 
He did n't smile , but the furrows in his brow faded , and his faceshone . 
He led the class through leg raises -- " Do not let the feet hit theground ! " 
-- and minute-long side-plank exercises that left several womensweating and groaning . 
One collapsed on her mat . 
" Stomach on fire ? " 
Mike asked . 
" Yes ! " 
a woman called out . 
" That 's what I like . 
" A man named <PERSON>Ray Smith</PERSON> stepped uncertainly into the gym , guided by his wife . 
Achurch deacon and an operations manager for a law firm , he had recently lost hiseyesight to diabetes . 
Mike turned the class over to another instructor and , withan arm around <PERSON>Ray</PERSON> 's waist , gently escorted him to a weight room in back . 
" We did 10 pounds last time , right ? " 
he asked . 
Ray nodded . 
Mike carefully placedthe weights in the older man 's hands and counted under his breath . 
" Good , good , " <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> told him . 
" Fantastic . 
" His next client was a man with a shaved head and a peace sign tattooed on onemuscled arm . 
Mike strapped on weightlifting gloves and worked out alongside him.A 38-year-old owner of a legal services company , <ORGANIZATION>Darnell Self</ORGANIZATION> sweated at thepull-up bar . 
" Keep pushing ! " 
Mike told him . 
" Two more . 
Good money , man , goodmoney ! 
" They did one-arm rolls , <PERSON>Darnell</PERSON> lifting 50 pounds , <PERSON>Mike 65</PERSON> . 
The room grew hot , the mirror fogged . 
Mike loaded weights onto barbells . 
Darnell looked doubtful . 
" That 90 's not for me , " he said . 
" I mean , one day I think I 'll be there . . . " " My bad , " <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> told him , switching the weights . 
" I normally work out with 120 . 
" Darnell picked up the barbells , grimacing . 
" Do it till it burns , " <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> told him . 
" It 's already burning . " 
" That 's how you do it . 
You 're going to have forearms like Popeye . 
" Darnell groaned and dropped the weights . 
He stood panting . 
" Last set , " <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> told him.Finally , <PERSON>Darnell</PERSON> laid the weights down . 
He tried to clasp <PERSON>Mike</PERSON> 's hand , but hewas too weak . 
" I was like a girl , man , " he said , laughing . 
" I could n't evenreally give you five . 
" Outside , the sun had risen . 
Mike stepped onto the brick walkway . 
Years ago , before the big houses came up , he and his brother used to drive out here with acarload of friends after the movies . 
It was all woods then , and they wentjoyriding and chased one another through the trees screaming about <PERSON>Jason</PERSON> , thehockey-masked killer from " <DATE>Friday</DATE> the 13th . 
" Now he stood still , gazing into the trees . 
There was no escaping the past , norany way to separate the crooked pathways of his own personal history fromwhatever lay ahead . 
It was <TIME>7:36 a.m</TIME> . 
The next wave of clients would be theresoon . 
Mike turned and walked back into the <PERSON>gym.Vanessa M. Gezari</PERSON> is a writer who lives in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> .
