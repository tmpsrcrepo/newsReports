Being a new worker matters , to you and to your employer . 
But how much does itmatter what sex you are?Have things changed much since the days when your mother first started work , when it was a " man 's " world ? 
Or is the unisex bathroom on " Ally McBeal " thesymbol of today 's workplace?Many women today entering their first or second job find that gender in theworkplace is not the issue it once was . 
The lines are blurring . 
Paid maternityleave and paternity leave , on-site child care , more women than men graduatingfrom college -- all signs point to a gender-neutral workplace , especially thoserun by members of Generation X.But why are women so underrepresented among the executive class , 12.5 percentnationwide , at major corporations ? 
And why are women still earning about 77cents for every dollar a man is earning ? 
And what are young women who are justentering the workplace finding out about themselves and how co-workers andsupervisors feel about the issue?Before <PERSON>Holly Kwartler</PERSON> , 25 , jumped from <ORGANIZATION>Kent State University</ORGANIZATION> into the wide worldof work , she thought a lot about gender issues in the workplace . 
" Gender wasvery much on my mind , " she said . 
" I 've been very pleased for the most part . 
" She found it encouraging that the District-based law firm where she works as arecruiter and trainer throws baby showers not just for the women , but for themen as well . 
Women and men both have the option of working part time or withflexible schedules.These soft benefits are all a sign that social equality in the workplace isalive and well , but that does n't mean <PERSON>Kwartler</PERSON> has n't noticed a differencebetween young women and their male counterparts with regard to building earlycareer success . 
" I think men are much better at not taking things personally . . . women maybepanic a little more , " something she does herself , she admitted.But one thing that has certainly seemed to change with her generation ofworkers , she said , is overt sexual harassment.Kwartler thinks sexual harassment at firms filled with young people just comingout of college would be close to nil . 
" I have a lot of faith in young men , " shesaid . 
" I think a lot of us who grew up with the <PERSON>Anita Hill-Clarence Thomashearings</PERSON> , we 've been made aware of it . 
" <PERSON>Susan Abrams</PERSON> , author of the book " The New Success Rules for Women , " agrees thattoday 's workplace is different than the one your mother entered . 
" It has changedand it will continue to change . 
" Making ConnectionsKaren <PERSON>Elliott Greisdorf</PERSON> , 32 , who runs her own communications company in theDistrict , helped develop a local networking group for young women calledTomorrow 's <ORGANIZATION>Leaders Today</ORGANIZATION> . 
Part of Women of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , a large multigenerationalnetworking organization , <ORGANIZATION>TLT</ORGANIZATION> brings young professionals and aspiringprofessionals together for monthly discussions , presentations and networkingevents.The program was launched <DATE>eight years ago</DATE> , after Women of <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> held aluncheon called " The Big M " to focus on menopause . 
One young woman came to theevent thinking the Big M meant marriage.That was when several young women realized their generation 's needs were notbeing met -- they had concerns in regard to their lives and careers that weredifferent from their more experienced female counterparts . 
" There have been a lot of women who have paved the way for our generation , butwe do n't stop to think about how much ground has already been covered , " <PERSON>Greisdorf</PERSON> said . 
" A certain level of assertiveness is generationally built in " for young women now.That may be in part because organizations started making a concerted effort topump up the success and recruitment of women.Sue <PERSON>Molina</PERSON> , a partner at <ORGANIZATION>Deloitte & Touche</ORGANIZATION> and national director for thecompany 's program Advancement of Women , started the women 's initiative aboutseven years ago when the company found its rate of retaining and recruitingwomen was low compared with that of men . 
" We concluded that our environment was male-dominated and it was n't veryflexible , " she said . 
" Women perceived their career opportunities were less thantheir male counterparts ' . 
" The initiative prompted gender-awareness seminars , formalized flex schedules andcareer-planning sessions . 
Since then , <PERSON>Molina</PERSON> said , things at <ORGANIZATION>Deloitte & Touchehave</ORGANIZATION> changed . 
Today , she said , " the women that are starting with us right out ofcollege have the same opportunities as men starting out . 
" Do n't Be ShyThough young women are coming into a friendlier workplace , where gender cansometimes be forgotten altogether , women by nature still have issues they needto overcome to succeed . 
Which is why <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> writes about the " new " rules ofsuccess for women , because there are new rules , many that women will writethemselves . 
" The first models for how to be a successful woman were to emulate men . . . . Ihad in the mid - <DATE>'80s</DATE> those man-tailored suits and blouses , " said <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> . 
" Thatwas very much the model . 
It meant that women had to act and dress like men . 
Butthat 's not an effective long-term strategy . 
What works now is come to the tableand draw new experiences . 
" In her book , <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> draws on the experiences of many women leaders in theworkplace . 
" I think oftentimes you hear about a woman 's instinct , but in the businessworld , because women are newer to the game , they 're less confident in speakingout and making their voice heard . 
" Hence , communication is key . 
If you felt slighted because you did n't get to sitin on a particular meeting , ask to come along next time , <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> said.Kwartler agrees , and she sees examples of her friends doing that . 
" What I 've witnessed in just talking to [ other ] women , if they do n'tcommunicate , there are obstacles for them , " <PERSON>Kwartler</PERSON> said . 
" If they communicate , they do quite well . 
" Some women coming out of college today would n't think twice about speaking theirmind , but others fall back on politeness , thinking they need to keep quiet , respect their superiors and not express their desires . 
" We 're socialized to bemore demure , to think about others , " <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> said.Start tooting your own horn , she said , and when you know there is something youwant , instead of just assuming it will be handed to you because you work hard , ask for it . 
" When you have something that 's important to you , let others know . 
Ask for thatkey assignment , key client , for a promotion or even the money , " <PERSON>Abrams</PERSON> said . 
Ifwomen do n't ask , they wo n't get , she said . 
" Women are convinced if they just doa great job , they will get promotions , raises or clients . " 
Not so.Forging AheadThere are a few things young women can do to make sure they start getting themost out of their careers . 
" You should n't assume that you 're going into the workforce and you 're not goingto encounter stereotypes . 
I think the overt discrimination has gone undergroundor been addressed , but there is a lot of subtle stuff going on , " said <PERSON>MaryMattis</PERSON> , a senior research fellow at Catalyst , a women 's research organization inNew <LOCATION>York</LOCATION> . 
So she has a few suggestions for young women that she says can helpthem to not be naive.When looking for a job , she said , check out the representation of women in thatcompany . 
Check to see if other women have been successful in advancing . 
Arethere women in a diverse range of jobs , on the board , among the corporateofficers ? 
" That might help you gauge if it 's a good environment for women , " shesaid.If you 're a young woman who plans to have a family , look at the leave policies , availability of a flexible schedule and benefits.And , of course , take advice and guidance from those who went before you andhelped to make the workplace a more gender-neutral environment . 
" Women have more role models now , " <PERSON>Mattis</PERSON> said . 
" But some women seem to berejecting those role models because they feel like they do n't want to or have tomake the same choices , work the excessive hours to prove themselves . 
One thing Iwould advise younger women , do n't reject those women who went before you .
