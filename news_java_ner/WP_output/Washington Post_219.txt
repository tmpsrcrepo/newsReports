<PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> sat in a wheelchair at the family kitchen table where he has eaten , prayed and argued for more than a halfcentury . 
All around him family memberswere shouting at each other , yet he was whispering . 
His voice sounded like windblowing across a field of winter stalks , rattling the husks . 
Lung cancer hasrobbed him of the breath to say all that he wants to about the scandal he stillstruggles to comprehend , and which ended his career as head football coach atPenn <ORGANIZATION>State University</ORGANIZATION> . 
The words come like gusts . 
" I wanted to build up , notbreak down , " he said.Crowded around the table were his three voluble sons , <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> , <PERSON>Jay</PERSON> , <PERSON>David</PERSON> , daughter <PERSON>Mary Kay</PERSON> , and his wife of 50 years , Sue , all chattering at once . 
In themiddle of the table a Lazy Susan loaded with trays of cornbread and mashedpotatoes spun by , swirling fast as the arguments . 
" If you go hungry , it 's yourown fault , " <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> likes to say . 
But <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> , 85 , could not eat . 
He sippedPepsi over crushed ice from a cup . 
Once , it would have been bourbon . 
His handshowed a tremor , and a wig replaced his once-fine head of black hair.Paterno 's hope is that time will be his ally when it comes to judging what hebuilt , versus what broke down . 
" I 'm not 31 years old trying to prove somethingto anybody , " he said . 
" I know where I am . " 
This is where he is : wracked byradiation and chemotherapy , in a wheelchair with a broken pelvis , and " shockedand saddened " as he struggles to explain a breakdown of devastating proportions.Jerry <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> , his former assistant coach at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> from <DATE>1969</DATE> to <DATE>1999</DATE> , ischarged with more than 50 counts of sexually abusing young boys over a 15-yearperiod . 
He maintains his innocence . 
If <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> is guilty , " I 'm sick about it , " Paterno said.How <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> , 67 , allegedly evaded detection by state child services , universityadministrators , teachers , parents , donors and <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> himself remains an openquestion . 
" I wish I knew , " <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> said . 
" I do n't know the answer to that . 
It ' shard . " 
Almost as difficult for <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> to answer is the question of why , afterreceiving a report in <DATE>2002</DATE> that <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> had abused a boy in the shower of <ORGANIZATION>PennState</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Lasch Football Building</ORGANIZATION> , and forwarding it to his superiors , he did n'tfollow up more aggressively . 
" I did n't know exactly how to handle it and I was afraid to do something thatmight jeopardize what the university procedure was , " he said . 
" So I backed awayand turned it over to some other people , people I thought would have a littlemore expertise than I did . 
It did n't work out that way . 
" Former athletic director <PERSON>Tim Curley</PERSON> and school vice president <PERSON>Gary Schultz</PERSON> facecharges of perjury and failing to report suspected child abuse , based on theirinaction . 
They have pleaded not guilty . 
Though he is not charged with a crime , <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON>Graham Spanier</PERSON> was fired on <DATE>Nov. 9</DATE> , along with Paterno.Paterno is accused of no wrongdoing , and in fact authorities have said hefulfilled his legal obligations by reporting to his superiors . 
Nevertheless , theuniversity <ORGANIZATION>Board of Trustees</ORGANIZATION> summarily dismissed him with a late-night phonecall four days after <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> 's arrest . 
At about <TIME>10 p.m.</TIME> , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> and Sue weregetting ready for bed when the doorbell rang . 
An assistant athletic director wasat the door , and wordlessly handed Sue a slip of paper . 
There was nothing on itbut the name of the vice chairman of trustees , <PERSON>John Surma</PERSON> , with a phone number.They stood frozen by the bedside in their nightclothes , Sue in a robe andPaterno in pajamas and a <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> sweatshirt . 
Paterno dialed the number.Surma told <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> , " In the best interests of the university , you areterminated . " 
Paterno hung up and repeated the words to his wife . 
She grabbed thephone and redialed . 
" After 61 years he deserved better , " she snapped . 
" He deserved better . 
" The firing provoked a riot on campus that night.To <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> students , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> was less a person than a beloved monument . 
Hehad arrived at a " cow college " in <DATE>1950</DATE> as an assistant coach armed with aflathead haircut , a <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> accent and a degree from <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> . 
As the head coachfrom <DATE>1966</DATE> on , he struck an austerely iconic pose , managing to be both fierce andbookish , with his black cleats and his thick black-framed glasses . 
To hisrivals , he was a holier-than-thou prig who intimated he was more principled thanthey were.Under his leadership <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> football became a kind of gross national productas he won more games than any other coach in history , yet regularly posted highgraduation rates - his team was ranked No. 1 academically out of the top 25football teams in <DATE>2009</DATE> and <DATE>2011</DATE> by the <ORGANIZATION>New America Foundation</ORGANIZATION> 's Academic BowlChampionship Series . 
The " cow college " grew into a public research universitywith <MONEY>$ 4.6 billion</MONEY> in revenue and buildings as large as airplane hangars . 
BeaverStadium was renovated and enlarged six times during his tenure.But after 61 years on the campus , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> cleared out his office in the space ofone day . 
It was an end he was unprepared for . 
Yet it came with the realizationthat as the face of the university , people assign him greater responsibilitythan other officials . 
" Whether it 's fair I do n't know , but they do it , " he said . 
" You would think <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> the show here . 
" Over two separate conversations on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> and <DATE>Friday</DATE> , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> discussed hiscareer and his actions relating to <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> . 
His attorney <PERSON>Wick Sollers</PERSON> of theWashington law firm <ORGANIZATION>King & Spalding</ORGANIZATION> , and a communications adviser , <PERSON>Dan McGinn</PERSON> ofTMG Strategies , monitored the conversations , in part to be sure <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> waslucid , since he has experienced fogginess from his chemo treatments , one ofwhich he underwent the day before the first interview.Since the scandal broke , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> has been largely silent while dealing with hishealth issues , despite scathing criticism that included accusations that heprotected <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> and wielded more power in the cloistered community known asHappy Valley than the university president.Paterno was initially reluctant to speak because " I wanted everybody to settledown , " he said . 
But he is so eager to defend his record that he insisted oncontinuing the interview from his bedside <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> , though ill . 
He washospitalized for observation later in the day due to complications from thechemo but , according to the family , had improved by <DATE>Saturday</DATE> morning.Mostly he sat in his wheelchair covered by a blanket , surrounded by pictures ofhis children and grandchildren , in the modest stone-and-plate-glass home hebought for <MONEY>$ 9,000</MONEY> in <DATE>1966</DATE> . 
The home , and the fact that his address and phone arestill listed in the <ORGANIZATION>State College</ORGANIZATION> phone book , have oft been cited as evidence ofhis regular-Joe values . 
A good deal of what he earned has gone back to theuniversity , in the form of donations to a library that bears his name and acampus spiritual center . 
" My father said about money : ' You have to have some . 
But you do n't have to haveall of it . 
Just be honest with yourself . ' 
" He displays only a few mementos of his football career , jumbled in a glass casein a dark corner of his old study , a small , woody space . 
Most of the items inthe case are personal souvenirs . 
Tucked in one corner is a card that says , " Thismarriage is interrupted for football season . " 
There are game balls , the mostprominent one from <DATE>Oct. 29 , 2011</DATE> , when the <ORGANIZATION>Nittany Lions</ORGANIZATION> defeated Illinois,10-7 , to make <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> the winningest coach in the annals of major collegefootball , with 409 victories.Sandusky was arrested just a week later.What <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> officials knew about <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> and when is the subject of nofewer than five formal investigations . 
They range from state Attorney <PERSON>GeneralLinda Kelly</PERSON> 's criminal investigation of <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> , to an <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> inquiry , to <ORGANIZATION>PennState</ORGANIZATION> 's in-house inquiry led by former <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>Louis J. Freeh</PERSON> . 
Thebest-case scenario is that the institutional leaders were guilty of blindness , and an unfeeling self-absorption . 
The worst case is a criminal cover-up toprotect a wealthy university 's reputation.This is <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's own account : On a <DATE>Saturday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> in <DATE>2002</DATE> , an upset young assistant coach named MikeMcQueary knocked on <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's door to tell him he had witnessed a shocking scenein the <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> football building showers . 
Until that moment , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> said , hehad " no inkling " that <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> might be a sexual deviant . 
By then <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> was aformer employee , with whom <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> had little to do . 
Although <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> had beenhis close coaching associate and helped fashion <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> defenses for threedecades , their relationship was " professional , not social , " as <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> describedit . 
" He was a lot younger than me . " 
Sandusky had been out of the program forthree years , and in fact , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> said he can not recall the last time he hadseen or spoken to <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> . 
" I ca n't , " he said.Sandusky retired in <DATE>1999</DATE> , shortly after <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> made the <LOCATION>Alamo Bowl</LOCATION> . 
Thetiming was curious . 
Paterno 's understanding was that <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> took earlyretirement on his recommendation after <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> told him frankly that he wouldnot become his successor . 
The state was offering 30-year employees a handsomebuyout , and <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> believed <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> should take it . 
Paterno was frustratedthat <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> spent so much time working on his youth foundation , The SecondMile , that he was not available to help in recruiting and other coaching duties.Authorities now say <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> used <ORGANIZATION>Second Mile</ORGANIZATION> to meet and groom his allegedvictims . 
" He came to see me and we talked a little about his career , " <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> said . 
" Isaid , you know , <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> , you want to be head coach , you ca n't do as much as you ' redoing with the other operation . 
I said this job takes so much detail , and foryou to think you can go off and get involved in fundraising and a lot of thingslike that . . . . I said you ca n't do both , that 's basically what I told him . 
" <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> insists he was completely unaware of a <DATE>1998</DATE> police investigation into areport from a Second Mile mother that <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> had inappropriately touched herson in a shower . 
The inquiry ended when the local prosecutor declined to bringcharges . 
" You know it was n't like it was something everybody in the buildingknew about , " <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> said . 
" Nobody knew about it . 
" <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> contends that ignorance was the context with which he heard <PERSON>McQueary</PERSON> ' sdisturbing story in <DATE>2002</DATE> . 
McQueary , sitting at <ORGANIZATION>Paterno</ORGANIZATION> 's kitchen table , told himthat he had been at the football building late the evening before when he heardnoises coming from the shower . 
" He was very upset and I said why , and he was very reluctant to get into it , " <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> said . 
" He told me what he saw , and I said , what ? 
He said it , well , looked like inappropriate , or fondling , I 'm not quite sure exactly how he putit . 
I said you did what you had to do . 
It 's my job now to figure out what wewant to do . 
So I sat around . 
It was a <DATE>Saturday</DATE> . 
Waited till <DATE>Sunday</DATE> because Iwanted to make sure I knew what I was doing . 
And then I called my superiors andI said : ' Hey , we got a problem , I think . 
Would you guys look into it ? ' 
Cause Idid n't know , you know . 
We never had , until that point , 58 years I think , I hadnever had to deal with something like that . 
And I did n't feel adequate . 
" At that point , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> set up a meeting for <ORGANIZATION>McQueary</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Curley</PERSON> , the athleticdirector , and <PERSON>Schultz</PERSON> , who oversaw university police . 
McQueary has testifiedthat he gave both men a far more graphic description of what he witnessed , whichhe believed to be <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> sodomizing a boy of about 10 , who had his handsagainst the shower wall . 
At the preliminary hearing for <PERSON>Curley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Schultz</PERSON> onDec . 
16 , <PERSON>McQueary</PERSON> said he had been reluctant to go into similar " great detailabout sexual acts " with <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> , out of respect for the coach , who was 75 at thetime.Schultz and <PERSON>Curley</PERSON> have maintained that <PERSON>McQueary</PERSON> failed to impart theseriousness of what he saw to them as well . 
They never told police about theallegation , instead informing <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> he could no longer bring children touniversity facilities . 
Prosecutors say <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> continued to abuse boys for sixmore years.Paterno has said , " In hindsight , I wish I had done more . 
" <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's portrait of himself is of an old-world man profoundly confused by whatMcQueary told him , and who was hesitant to make follow-up calls because he didnot want to be seen as trying to exert any influence for or against <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> . 
" Idid n't know which way to go , " he said . 
" And rather than get in there and make amistake . . . " He reiterated that <PERSON>McQueary</PERSON> was unclear with him about the nature of what he saw - and added that even if <ORGANIZATION>McQueary</ORGANIZATION> had been more graphic , he 's not sure he wouldhave comprehended it . 
" You know , he did n't want to get specific , " <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> said . 
" And to be frank withyou I do n't know that it would have done any good , because I never heard of , of , rape and a man . 
So I just did what I thought was best . 
I talked to people that Ithought would be , if there was a problem , that would be following up on it . 
" <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> declined to judge <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> , or his other <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> colleagues . 
" I thinkwe got to wait and see what happens , " he said . 
" The courts are taking care ofit , the legal system is taking care of it . 
" According to <PERSON>Sollers</PERSON> , the attorney , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> has no legal exposure in theSandusky case . 
Paterno has cooperated fully with the investigation , and has " meton multiple occasions voluntarily " with representatives from the attorneygeneral 's office , <PERSON>Sollers</PERSON> said . 
" In my judgment Coach <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> has no legalliability in this matter . 
In fact , he acted completely appropriately inreporting the only allegation he received to his superiors and had everyexpectation that the allegation would be investigated thoroughly . 
" <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> has felt smaller repercussions.His son <PERSON>Scott</PERSON> says <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> has been " shunned " by many in the university , thoughhe did hear from current <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Rodney Erickson</PERSON> last week whenhe made a <MONEY>$ 100,000</MONEY> donation to the school . 
His name has been removed fromtrophies . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Maxwell Football Club</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> has discontinued its JosephV . 
Paterno Award , which was to be given to coaches who made a positive impact . 
Anomination for the <ORGANIZATION>Presidential Medal of Freedom</ORGANIZATION> was withdrawn.But <PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> is not the victim here , he reminds you . 
" You know , I 'm not as concerned about me , " he said . 
" What 's happened to me hasbeen great . 
I got five great kids . 
Seventeen great grandchildren . 
I 've had awonderful experience here at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> . 
I do n't want to walk away from thisthing bitter . 
I want to be helpful . 
" The Paternos say they think about the real potential victims every time theylook at their own children . 
" I got three boys and two girls , " <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> said . 
" It 's sickening . " 
His knee-jerk response is to go back to <LOCATION>Flatbush</LOCATION> . 
" Violence isnot the way to handle it , " he said . 
" But for me , I 'd get a bunch of guys and saylet 's go punch somebody in the nose . " 
Sue <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> is more blunt . 
" If someonetouched my child , there would n't be a trial , I would have killed them , " shesaid . 
" That would be my attitude , because you have destroyed someone for life . 
" She sighed . 
" It 's a bad scene for this happy valley . 
" The <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> investigation has torn apart a cloistered town-and-gown communitywhere everyone knows everyone - including <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> . 
Old friends can not talk toeach other because criminal trials are imminent . 
Recently Sue went to thefuneral of <PERSON>Tim Curley</PERSON> 's mother . 
The Paternos have known <PERSON>John Surma</PERSON> for years - <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> recruited his brother . 
Underneath the tension is the complicatedknowledge that if <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> is guilty , he was as good at seducing the adults ashe was the children.If nothing else , the Paternos say , perhaps the <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> case will raiseconsciousness in other communities the way it has been raised in theirs . 
" We aregoing to become a more aware society , " Sue said . 
" Maybe we will look for clues . 
" She wonders what signs she missed all those years , when they felt so successfuland sure of themselves . 
" I had no clue , " she said . 
" I thought doctors looked for child abuse in ahospital , in a bruise or something . 
" It remains to be seen , barring any new revelations , whether there will be areappraisal of <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's life and record at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> . 
Eventually , his familyhopes , there will be healing and forgiveness in the community , and the outlinesof the man they insist <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> is , and not the monument or monumental target , will reemerge : A modest , decent , fundamentally devoted coach who always lovedbooks more than money.His starting salary was just <MONEY>$ 20,000</MONEY> . 
In <DATE>1972</DATE> the <ORGANIZATION>New England Patriots</ORGANIZATION> offeredhim <MONEY>$ 1.3 million</MONEY> to become coach and general manager . 
But at <TIME>5:30 a.m.</TIME> on theday he intended fly to <LOCATION>Boston</LOCATION> to accept , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> woke up and realized it wasmistake . 
He said to his wife : " You went to bed with a millionaire but you wokeup with me . 
I 'm not going . " 
He stayed at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> , though he was making just <MONEY>$ 35,000</MONEY> . 
In <DATE>2008</DATE> his salary of <MONEY>$ 1.03 million</MONEY> was still fractional compared topeers , some of whom now make <MONEY>$ 4 million.Paterno</MONEY> 's record is not perfect . 
Anyone who won on his scale has an ungenerouscompetitive streak and nascent ego . 
His love for higher learning - he likes toname-drop <PERSON>Puccini</PERSON> and <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> - could tip over into superiority . 
He could show atemper , as he did in <DATE>1995</DATE> when a camera caught him delivering a profane on-fieldtirade . 
His football program was not immune to the problems of big-time collegeathletics . 
An ESPN inquiry found that from <DATE>2002</DATE> to <DATE>2007</DATE> , 46 <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> footballplayers faced criminal charges . 
But he liked working with problem cases andturning them around . 
" Hotshots , " he still calls them today . 
The <DATE>2007</DATE> team had 19players who earned Academic all-Big Ten honors . 
" The bigger the problem the guywas , the more I enjoyed it when we had success , " he said.Over the course of his career , 47 of his players made Academic all-American , thethird-highest total among institutions playing at the championship level.He loved his work . 
" They were all days I looked forward to , " he said . 
Hisphilosophy was simple . 
" My thing was play as hard as you can , do n't be stupid , pay attention to details , and have enough guts in the clutch that you 're notafraid to make a play , " he said . 
" Some things I thought were important for ayoung man to know . 
" Early on , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> vowed that he would try to never lose perspective . 
In <DATE>1968</DATE> hesaid : " We 're trying to win football games , do n't misunderstand that . 
But I do n'twant it to ruin our lives if we lose . 
I do n't want us ever to become the kind ofplace where an 8-2 season is a tragedy . 
" Asked if he succeeded in keeping the vow , he said : " I stayed on the track Iwanted to stay on . 
I do n't think I deviated from what I 'm all about and what Ithought was important . 
Whether you want to call that a legacy , or whatever youwant to call it . 
" These are the things <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> would prefer to reminisce about . 
Instead , he istying up the loose ends of the abrupt end to his career . 
There are mounds ofmail to deal with , 12,000 letters ( his grandchildren counted them ) . 
Former <ORGANIZATION>PennState</ORGANIZATION> running back <PERSON>Franco Harris</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Famer</ORGANIZATION> , checksin regularly and is leading a furious campaign to depose the <ORGANIZATION>Board of Trusteesfor</ORGANIZATION> their handling of the scandal and <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's dismissal . 
Paterno tries to playpeacemaker , although he admits his first reaction was , " Raise hell . " 
There arestill details to work out with the school , because he remains a tenuredprofessor . 
On <DATE>Jan. 2</DATE> the university sent him a retirement letter . 
" Right now I 'm trying to figure out what I 'm gon na do , " he said . 
" Cause I do n'twant to sit around on my backside all day . " 
He grins and there is a light behindhis glasses . 
" If I 'm gon na do that I 'll be a newspaper reporter . 
" Nevertheless , sitting is mostly what he does , surrounded by the photographs thathave accrued on the walls for almost a half-century . 
They provoke memories . 
Hisfather , <LOCATION>Angelo</LOCATION> , studying late at a kitchen table to become a court clerk , impressing on him the open-endedness of learning . 
His deep pride at beingadmitted to <ORGANIZATION>Ivy League</ORGANIZATION> schools , followed by chagrin when he visited Princetonand no one in the eating clubs would speak to him . 
" Bunch of stuffed shirts , " hesaid . 
His wound when frat boys at <PERSON>Brown</PERSON> frowned at him for wearing sweatersinstead of tweeds and said , " How did that dago get invited ? " 
His mother , when hecalled to tell her that he was finally ready to wed at 34 , to a young woman hehad met , of course , in the library . 
" I 'm getting married . " 
" To who ? " 
" <PERSON>Susie</PERSON> . 
You know <PERSON>Susie</PERSON> . " 
" That big German girl ? " 
" Yes , Ma , she 's German . " 
" What the hell are you gon na eat ? 
" The big German girl is in fact slender as a schoolgirl and still has world-classcheekbones at 75 . 
She tends to <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> gently , ushering him from kitchen tableto bedroom and back again , clasping his hand when it trembles . 
" Speak up , " Suetells him . 
Paterno smiles and rasps , " Ordinarily she tells me to shut up . 
" Every little while , Sue pulls a picture from a wall and shows it to <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> orshares it with one of his many visitors . 
They are invariably photos of children , of sons and daughters and grandchildren . 
The children are captured in time andthey are all beautiful . 
They are new , unmarked , angel-faced , radiant . 
These arethe images the Paternos cling to , through all the levels of distortion , thepress maelstrom , the impending trials , the grotesqueries described on witnessstands . 
Whenever someone in her family loses their emotional way , and sits atthe kitchen table weeping for something that 's been lost or torn down , Sue holdsa frame out to them and shows them a photograph of unspoiled familial innocence . 
" Look at this picture , " she tells them . 
" This is who we are . 
And no one can takeus from us .
