Reprinted from <DATE>Thursday</DATE> 's editionsIf I were <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Bob McDonnell</PERSON> , I would feel more than a little resentfulat getting a mere 10 minutes of cable-only television exposure at the Republicanconvention in <LOCATION>Tampa</LOCATION> . 
I mean , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> can boast of a stronger record ofconservative accomplishments than the evening 's big star , <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>ChrisChristie</PERSON> , the keynote speaker.McDonnell was workmanlike in the second-biggest speech of his career , after his2010 response to President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's <LOCATION>State of the Union</LOCATION> address . 
On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , hemade a solid , albeit predictable , case against the Democrats for supposedlydisrespecting entrepreneurs and killing jobs.But it 's safe to say the effort was viewed only by Republican activists andother political aficionados . 
The main broadcast networks did n't carryMcDonnell 's address , which aired on cable networks at <TIME>8:45 p.m.</TIME> <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> and CBSbegan covering the convention more than an hour later.McDonnell is too much of a party loyalist to say so , but I can : His achievementsin <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , and his service as chairman of the Republican GovernorsAssociation , merited a more prominent slot.Christie , whose widely broadcast address http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ann-romney-gov-christie-to-address-gop-convention-tuesday-night/2012/08/28/de21d634-f0fd-11e1-a612-3cfc842a6d89_story.htmlreceived mixed reviews , presides over a state with the nation 's fourth-highest unemployment rate.Virginia 's is 10th lowest.Christie also let down his party in <DATE>November</DATE> 's state legislative elections , inwhich Democrats retained control of both chambers . 
In the same month , theMcDonnell-led <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> GOP effectively took back the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> , thus gainingfull control of the General Assembly.As for <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> 's Rep. <PERSON>Paul Ryan</PERSON> , who beat out <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> and others for thevice presidential nomination , he has zero executive experience . 
He has spentalmost his entire career as a pointy-headed policy wonk and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> insider , precisely the background that the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> faithful despise.McDonnell has been state attorney general as well as governor ( and he was alegislator before that ) . 
He also served his country as an <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> officer . 
NeitherChristie nor <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON> is a veteran.For a term-limited governor such as <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> , who needs to maximize his futurecareer possibilities , a convention speech could , and probably should , have beenan ideal way to attract attention . 
If only it had come when the networks werepaying attention.And chairing the platform committee was meager consolation . 
The main thinganybody remembers about the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> platform is that presidential nominee MittRomney pointedly disagrees with some of its most conservative positions ( notablyits opposition to abortion without exceptions for rape and incest ) . 
McDonnell 's part in the supporting cast reflects three hard truths that willhelp shape his future as he looks for a job at the national level after ( orbefore ? ) 
his governorship ends in early <DATE>2014</DATE> . 
<ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> is not as combative and colorful a performer as <ORGANIZATION>Christie</ORGANIZATION> . 
TheVirginian is energetic , articulate and earnest , but he does n't connect withaudiences emotionally the way Christie does.Although he 's conservative on budget matters , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> is not as radical aboutshrinking the government as <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON> . 
The congressman 's outspoken advocacy on thatissue vaulted him to the junior spot on the national ticket to calm fears in theGOP base that <PERSON>Romney</PERSON> is too moderate.Finally , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> ca n't fully shed his troublesome record on women 's issues . 
Ineach of the past two years , he signed legislation that had the effect ofrestricting access to abortion . 
The most recent measure , which ignited fieryprotest among women 's groups ( not to mention ridicule from late-nightcomedians ) , requires women to undergo an ultrasound before terminating apregnancy.Such measures give Democrats and other critics a ready-made opportunity toremind voters of the controversial master 's thesis that <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> wrote in 1989at Christian evangelical <ORGANIZATION>Regent University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Among other things , he said workingmothers hurt families.That background hurt <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> 's prospects for the vice presidency , given theGOP 's need to reach out to women . 
It would surely arise in the future should herun for the presidency or be considered again as a running mate.On the other hand , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> 's temperate , good-soldier style would be a plus ina lot of top-level jobs . 
If Romney wins , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> would be a strong candidatefor a Cabinet post , possibly attorney general or at least secretary of veteransaffairs . 
If <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> is reelected , then there 's talk of <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> as chairman ofthe <ORGANIZATION>Republican National Committee.Given</ORGANIZATION> his record in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> and his progress up the Republican hierarchy , wecould see a lot more of <ORGANIZATION>Bob McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> at future GOP conventions.mccartneyr@washpost.comI discuss local issues at <TIME>8:51 a.m.</TIME> <DATE>Friday</DATE> on <ORGANIZATION>WAMU</ORGANIZATION> ( 88.5 FM ) .
