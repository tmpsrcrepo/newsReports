When <ORGANIZATION>Fox</ORGANIZATION> announced in <DATE>June 2011</DATE> it was canceling " <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's Most Wanted " after23 years , nobody was more surprised than <PERSON>John Walsh</PERSON> . 
" Our ratings were great , " said <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> , 66 , the host of the show . 
" We ownedSaturday nights . 
" But financially , it had been a rocky few years for the Silver Spring-basedtelevision show . 
In <DATE>2010</DATE> , " <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's Most Wanted " shut down its LosAngeles-based <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> bureau and laid off one-third of its staff . 
There hadbeen more budget cuts since then , and funds were tight.A year later , " <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's Most Wanted " has a weekly spot on Lifetime . 
The show isoperating with one-third of the staff and one-third of the budget it once had , but executives at Lifetime , the New York-based cable network that specializes inprogramming geared toward women , said the show has been successful . 
" The minute we heard it might be available , we knew we wanted it , " said <PERSON>RobSharenow</PERSON> , executive vice president for programming at Lifetime . 
" We had a dealwithin weeks . 
" <PERSON>Sharenow</PERSON> declined to discuss the show 's financial status but said it has boostedthe network 's <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> ratings by <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> . 
" We 've become leaner and meaner - we have to be in this economy , " said <PERSON>RogerChiang</PERSON> , who has been working for the show for five years . 
" We have a producerwho does three other jobs . 
I 'm the CFO , <ORGANIZATION>COO</ORGANIZATION> and the executive in charge . 
It 's acollaborative effort . 
" When the show started in the <DATE>late 1980s</DATE> , it was one of the few commercialtelevision shows filmed in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> area , <PERSON>Chiang</PERSON> said . 
Qualified crewmembers were difficult to find - many relocated from <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> to work on theprogram.In the decades since , the rise of Washington-based Black EntertainmentTelevision and <ORGANIZATION>Silver Spring 's Discovery Communications</ORGANIZATION> - the company behindAnimal Planet and TLC - has created a larger base of television producers , directors and editors in the area . 
" The proliferation of television production in <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> has really mushroomed , " Chiang said . 
" We were the staple here in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for 20-something years . 
" How the show startedWalsh , a hotel developer by training , was working on a <MONEY>$ 26 million</MONEY> project inParadise <LOCATION>Island</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION> , when his 6-year-old son was kidnapped from a departmentstore and murdered in the <DATE>summer of 1981</DATE> . 
<PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> and his wife lobbied for tougher laws governing sex offender registriesand stricter sentences for those convicted of sex crimes and child abuse . 
" All I wanted to do after that was try to change laws , to testify in <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> , " Walsh said.He began spending more and more time in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and forged ties with <ORGANIZATION>theNational Center for Missing & Exploited Children</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>Alexandria.A few years later</DATE> , executives from Fox asked <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> whether he 'd like to host thenetwork 's first reality show.He told them he was n't interested . 
" I said ' What is reality television ? 
What is Fox ? 
And who is <ORGANIZATION>Rupert Murdoch</ORGANIZATION> ? 
, ' " he recalled . 
" I told them , I do n't want to go to <LOCATION>Hollywood</LOCATION> . 
I 'm not a showbizguy . 
" They agreed on a compromise : <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> could film in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> area , where he ' dbe close to law enforcement officials . 
He agreed to give it a shot . ' 
A Hollywood thriller ' Earlier this month , <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> spent the day filming with the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> . 
He flew ina helicopter over the District and cruised the <LOCATION>Potomac River</LOCATION> on a small boat.A second boat , which was coasting alongside <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> 's craft , carried the show ' scameramen , lighting reflectors and a teleprompter that displayed the host ' sscript.Walsh took off his life vest and tossed it aside . 
The camera began to roll . 
" I 'm here with the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> , and what you see behind me is the skylineof <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , " he began to say.Cut , someone said . 
We ca n't see the skyline behind the trees.The boats were repositioned . 
<PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> recited his lines again.He continued : " Now our next case sounds like the plot of a Hollywood thriller . 
" The show 's formulaThe basic premise of almost every " <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's Most Wanted " segment is quitesimilar , said <PERSON>Greg Klein</PERSON> , co-executive producer of the show . 
There 's a fugitiveon the loose who 's done something really bad - killed , raped , kidnapped , robbed - and viewers are asked to call in with tips and leads . 
" It 's the standard boy-meets-girl story , " <PERSON>Klein</PERSON> said . 
" But it often ends up boykills girl , boy puts girl in a septic tank . 
" Producers use footage from surveillance tapes and crime scene photos when theycan . 
They interview victims and their families and film reenactments - thecostliest component of the show - to fill in the gaps.There are currently about 30 people on staff - down from 100 last <DATE>summer</DATE> - including two who staff the show 's telephone hotline until <TIME>2 a.m.</TIME> every <DATE>Friday</DATE> , taking down up to 130 tips a night and relaying them to law enforcementofficials.The show 's approach is the same as it has always been , producers said , but addedthat Lifetime 's base of female viewers have been particularly receptive to theshow and its mission to protect children . 
The cable channel has ordered 44episodes for the first season.Walsh and his team say they are hopeful the show will continue for a secondseason . 
" When Lifetime came to me , I thought , okay , we 'll pump some testosterone intoFriday night , " <PERSON>Walsh</PERSON> said . 
" And now we 've upped the capture rate . 
We 're catchingpeople out of the country , all over the world .
