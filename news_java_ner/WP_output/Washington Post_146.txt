Somewhere deep in the nightscape of his own created world , the dark conspiracytheories became all too real for Art Bell . 
And so , angry , frightened , hunted , one of the country 's most popular radio hosts simply walked away in <DATE>Saturday</DATE> ' searly-morning hours.Bell , who hosted " Coast to <ORGANIZATION>Coast AM</ORGANIZATION> " overnights during the week ( heard locallyfrom 1 to <TIME>5 a.m.</TIME> on WWRC , 570-AM ) , built an audience of 10 million listeners onmore than 460 stations nationwide over a decade . 
The rich-voiced host delveddeeply into topics that at once unsettle and fascinate : UFOs , alien abduction , signs of the apocalypse and secret government projects.A cardinal rule of talk radio is : It 's all entertainment . 
And though Bell wasoften impassioned about some topics , he never got so impassioned that heslandered anyone or threatened violence . 
Which is what has happened to Bell , says his lawyer , <ORGANIZATION>Gerard Fox of Los Angeles</ORGANIZATION> . 
And it is why , at 54 , <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> isretiring from the air -- again . 
" In order that you all understand the gravity of the announcement I 'm about tomake , " <PERSON>Bell</PERSON> said at about <TIME>2 a.m.</TIME> <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> time on <DATE>Saturday</DATE> , " it 's going to benecessary for me to repeat some very painful events that have occurred to myfamily over the past several years . 
" Bell then recounted the saga that began in <DATE>1997</DATE> when his son , Art Bell IV , wasmolested by an HIV-positive male schoolteacher , now imprisoned for that andother sex and drug charges . 
The younger Bell is suing the ex-teacher and aNevada school district and routinely undergoes HIV tests . 
Now 19 , he has thusfar tested negative , Fox says.Then , in <DATE>December 1997</DATE> , <PERSON>Ted Gunderson</PERSON> and <PERSON>David Hinkson</PERSON> -- both of whom had haddealings with Bell -- bought time on <ORGANIZATION>WWCR</ORGANIZATION> , a shortwave radio station in <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> , and said <PERSON>Bell</PERSON> had molested children in his home state of <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and bribedpolice to cover it up.Since then , <ORGANIZATION>Fox</ORGANIZATION> says , the allegations have spread across the Internet and thefringe radio industry.The elder <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> is suing <PERSON>Gunderson</PERSON> , <PERSON>Hinkson</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>WWCR</ORGANIZATION> for slander . 
The defendantsin the elder <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> 's suit have asked for a summary judgment , set for <DATE>April 28</DATE> inNashville.The allegations , though untrue , <ORGANIZATION>Fox</ORGANIZATION> says , have prompted a handful of deaththreats against <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> over the past year and a half.Fox has received protective injunctions against some threat-makers and enlistedthe help of a family in tracking down one of its members who said he wanted to " drive to <LOCATION>Nevada</LOCATION> and kill Art Bell , " Fox says.Bell quit his show for a time in late <DATE>1998</DATE> , citing these reasons . 
He returned tothe air but soon decided to quit again -- this time permanently , <ORGANIZATION>Fox</ORGANIZATION> says . 
" He wants to be as private a person as possible , " Fox says , adding that one ofthe occupational hazards of <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> 's job has been " people who show up on hisdoorstep who think he can help them communicate with some alien race . 
" Bell 's listeners are left in the lurch . 
For the sleep-deprived , the paranoid andthe well-adjusted bulk of <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> 's audience who simply loved his show for theentertainment value -- myself included -- there is no substitute.Bell 's syndicator , <ORGANIZATION>Premiere Radio Networks</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> , says that the showwill go on with a new host.If a radio personality had gone to a syndicator and pitched a show like <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> 's , he would have been laughed out of the office . 
But <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> found the audience andplayed to them with remarkable success , broadcasting from his desert home studioin <LOCATION>Nye County</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Nev.</LOCATION> , or , as <ORGANIZATION>Bell</ORGANIZATION> called it , " the Kingdom of <PERSON>Nye</PERSON> . " 
It 's a shamethat some of the more unstable members of that audience did n't realize thatBell 's show -- like a hair-raising ghost story -- was meant to be good fun.WGMS 's Classical <PERSON>GaffeDennis Owens</PERSON> has hosted mornings on WGMS ( 103.5 ) for 20 years , wielding a witty , provocative , sometimes sarcastic style to anchor the city 's most popularclassical station . 
Still , it seems an unlikely spot on the dial to findoffensive material.Yet , on <DATE>St. Patrick 's Day</DATE> , some listeners did.Owens was running an Irish-themed show that day , and brought up Irish authorFrank <PERSON>McCourt</PERSON> 's recent memoir , " 'T is , " which <PERSON>Owens</PERSON> lauded . 
McCourt hates thetraditional <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> St. <PERSON>Patrick</PERSON> 's Day parade , <PERSON>Owens</PERSON> reported , because it givesfolks an excuse to drink too much and behave stupidly , giving the impressionthat the Irish are dimwitted drunks . 
To illustrate the power of perception , <PERSON>Owens</PERSON> repeated a joke he 'd heard : " What 's three miles long and has an IQ of 40 ? 
The <ORGANIZATION>New York St. Patrick</ORGANIZATION> 's DayParade . 
" What followed was an object lesson in how things work in today 's highly charged,media-savvy climate , where the politics of personal identity rule.WGMS received two e-mails and a couple of phone calls from offended listeners , reports station marketing director <PERSON>Steve Nicklin</PERSON> . 
In radio , that 's not even ablip . 
Instead , other aggrieved parties called the Rev. <PERSON>Sean McManus</PERSON> of the IrishNational Caucus on Capitol Hill , beseeching : " ' Father <PERSON>McManus</PERSON> , what are yougoing to do about this ? ' " 
according to the priest . 
" I explained to the [ WGMS ] people that I had to do something about this , " saysMcManus . 
" People expect people like myself to protest this type of thing . 
" <PERSON>McManus</PERSON> called the station <DATE>Friday</DATE> . 
Station managers talked with <PERSON>Owens</PERSON> andpromised <PERSON>McManus</PERSON> an on-air apology . 
On <DATE>Monday</DATE> , <PERSON>McManus</PERSON> issued a press release , demanding the apology he already knew was coming . 
The same day , WGMS issued itsown release , promising an apology from <PERSON>Owens</PERSON> the <DATE>next day</DATE> , which he made andMcManus says he accepts , though he did not tune in to hear it and had neverheard <PERSON>Owens</PERSON> 's show.McManus does n't believe that Irish Americans still face the same sort ofprejudice as African Americans do , he says . 
He adds , however , that he cannotaccept the " double standard " that tolerates an offensive joke against the Irishwhile condemning one against another minority group.But the whole matter is " very complicated , " he says . 
" For example , if <ORGANIZATION>Teddy Kennedy</ORGANIZATION> got up and told a joke about the Irish and it wassort of [ a ] put-down , well , I think he might be able to get away with it , " saysMcManus.As for <PERSON>Owens</PERSON> , 65 , he received no disciplinary action from WGMS and says he was " pulled up short " by the controversy . 
In his apology , he said : " I 'd like topause here for a moment this morning to correct a grave error I made on-air lastFriday during our celebration of the Irish national holiday . 
" <PERSON>Owens</PERSON> was born in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> , where he lived until age 16 . 
His family emigrated toCanada , and he worked on the air in <LOCATION>Bermuda</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> before coming to WGMS.And , he points out , he is Irish on his mother 's side -- his mother 's father was anIrish cop in <LOCATION>Wales</LOCATION> who took a bullet.Still , he says , the <ORGANIZATION>St. Patrick</ORGANIZATION> 's Day incident chastened him . 
" Everybody in entertainment seeks approval and I 'm not looking to upset anyone , " <PERSON>Owens</PERSON> says . 
The incident " reminded me to stay as careful as you can . 
I think youshould be responsibly funny and responsibly entertaining . 
" Today is the day to talk about radio with The Listener .
