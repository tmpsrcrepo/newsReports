Hundreds of folks in <LOCATION>Bethesda</LOCATION> are fighting the fitness company that splashed aracy billboard across a corner of their neighborhood.The offending ad shows a skinny woman on all fours , prowling atop a pool table.Right above the fancy new sandwich place.It 's sexist , they say . 
It degrades women . 
" Our children should n't be subjected to this , " reads the petition circulatingaround <LOCATION>Bethesda</LOCATION> , asking the CEO of <ORGANIZATION>Equinox</ORGANIZATION> gym to kill the ad . 
" Our femalefriends and family should n't be viewed like this , nor forced to conform to it.Our male partners and colleagues should n't be boxed in to thinking this isnormal . 
This is the kind of not-so-subtle sexism that infects our culture , anddegrades an entire gender . 
" I could n't agree more.And I 'm inspired . 
We need to scrub sexism from our streets.Maybe <PERSON>John Ashcroft</PERSON> was on to something when he insisted on covering the nudiestatues at the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Justice.Every</ORGANIZATION> day when we walk from the Metro or go on an evening stroll , my childrenare subjected to a hypersexualized depiction of the human form , idealized bodiesand full-frontal nudity.Yet no one has spoken up about the raunchiness of that orgy known as <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> ' sCourt , the fountain right outside the <ORGANIZATION>Library of Congress</ORGANIZATION> on Capitol Hill thatlooks like a scene from <PERSON>Hugh Hefner</PERSON> 's grotto.Have you seen it?Neptune sits high in the middle , flanked by <ORGANIZATION>Tritons</ORGANIZATION> , escorted by writhing nymphsstraddling bucking sea horses . 
Everyone 's naked.Yeah , I totally think book collections and patent archives when I see thisdisplay.When my boys look at <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> and his rippling Tritons , how are they supposed tofeel about the expectations for their bodies ? 
What does this say about their ownvision of masculinity and what it means to be a male today?With its sexist art , the <ORGANIZATION>Library of Congress</ORGANIZATION> is telling boys it 's not okay towear glasses , do the dishes and respect their nerdy pursuits . 
Do they have toconform to be all cut and dominant , rolling with a posse of equally buff dudesand surrounded by naked women?Not only does <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> 's muscled maleness depict an unrealistic ideal of the maleform ( hello , protein powder addiction , steroid habit ? ) 
, but what about theexposed , um , nether parts on those three?The size of those features , on a sculpture to celebrate the nation 's literarycollection , is enough to make any male feel inadequate.Water has been lapping at the <ORGANIZATION>Tritons</ORGANIZATION> ' exposed crotches and spraying on the seanymphs ' bare chests for more than a century - and no one has uttered a word ofprotest.The only controversy that accompanied the construction of the nation 's libraryin the <DATE>1890s</DATE> was the type of cement used for the foundation , the style of thebuilding and the breadth of the nation 's literary collection.Weird.Maybe , for 100 years , folks have looked past that fountain for more substantiveways to change society . 
They 've seen it for what it is - art . 
Provocative , perhaps unseemly . 
But it 's not the only image their children will ever see.My kids laugh at the <LOCATION>Neptune</LOCATION> fountain and feed the ducks that swim in it . 
Theywill learn about the many facets of masculinity from lots of people , includingtheir father , their teacher at robotics camp , their taekwondo instructors , theuncle who needlepoints and fishes with them , the dads they see walking allaround Capitol Hill with babies strapped to their chests.The people who hate the <ORGANIZATION>Equinox</ORGANIZATION> billboard in <LOCATION>Bethesda</LOCATION> are correct - the ad isdumb . 
But the campaign is misplaced energy that looks more like censorship thanfeminism . 
" Our daughters and sons walk by the billboard outside <LOCATION>Equinox</LOCATION> Gym every day.They see a woman in a degrading sexual position , being ' celebrated ' for herhypersexualized and supposed dexterity , with a pool cue and balls . 
This issomehow meant to advertise for a fitness facility , " says the petition onChange.org , signed by at least 800 people as of Thursday.But these daughters , if they check in on any media other than the localbillboard , will see female athletes , politicians , war veterans , pilots , scientists , artists who are not stick-thin and compromised on a pool table.Degrading women means legislation that dictates what happens to their bodies andtheir futures without their input . 
It means less pay for equal work . 
It meansignoring systemic , sexual abuse by superiors who treat offenses like a joke . 
Itmeans a <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> that represents <PERCENT>51 percent</PERCENT> of the population with less than 20percent of its members.A billboard ? 
That 's the least of women 's problems.petula.dvorak@washpost.comTo read previous columns , go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak .
