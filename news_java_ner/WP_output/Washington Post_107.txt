You 've probably never heard of N Street Village , but it 's a nonprofit where morethan 1,400 homeless women are fed , clothed , housed , educated , healed andcounseled every year.For more than 40 years , N Street Village has been an example of how a small , properly run homeless shelter in downtown <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> can serve the needyeffectively and compassionately . 
The shelter continued to fulfill that missioneven as <LOCATION>Logan Circle</LOCATION> changed around it , shifting from Prostitution Central to aneighborhood of million-dollar condos and high-priced restaurants.N Street Village is the polar opposite of the ghetto the city has created atD.C . 
General , an abandoned hospital in <LOCATION>Southeast Washington</LOCATION> that serves as thelargest family shelter in the nation 's capital . 
On <DATE>Sunday</DATE> , three of mycolleagues at <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> published an investigation into thedysfunction and decay at <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> General . 
The alleged sexual assaults , vermin , filthy water and lack of heat are exactly what happens when we herd hundreds ofvulnerable parents and children into one huge facility hidden from the city ' supwardly mobile eyes . 
And not even the disappearance and presumed death of8-year-old <PERSON>Relisha Rudd</PERSON> have made a real dent in our apathy.For years , I 've been visiting this place , and it always takes a while to shakeoff the smells , the sounds and the feelings of a dead-end village . 
It 's not thehomeless parents and their kids who give you that feeling . 
No . 
You meet bouncygirls with cute braids , a high school valedictorian or a scootering little boy , and you marvel at the optimism and light they still have in a part of the citythat no one wants to see.But the sprawling campus where they live shares land with a clinic for methrehabilitation and sexually transmitted diseases , the city jail and the oldmorgue . 
The folks who hang out where as many as 600 children play , run , walk andwait for the bus are the kind many of us rush our kids past every day - peoplegetting high , cursing , spitting , glaring.We see them on the street corner and quicken our pace . 
These kids share theirfront porch with them all day , every day.The building itself is infested and dirty , The Post investigation found.According to the newspaper 's report this <DATE>weekend</DATE> , kids living at <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> Generalhave gotten skin rashes and scabies and have gone to the hospital after beingcovered in bug bites . 
This month , the doctor who runs the health clinic told aD.C . 
Council committee that the children at the shelter have a disproportionateamount of disease , depression and obesity.The outrageous part?Whenever anyone writes anything about this place , there 's always an outpouringfrom folks who say the District 's growing homelessness crisis is aboutentitlement , laziness and people looking for a handout . 
Trust me . 
None of themothers apparently washing their babies in brown water or chasing mice androaches away from their beds want to be there.But real solutions have been elusive because other parts of the city simplydo n't want to have anything to do with these families.The most jarring example happened in Ward 4 a few years ago , when the Districtwanted to renovate the old <ORGANIZATION>Hebrew Home</ORGANIZATION> for the Aged on <ORGANIZATION>Spring Road NW</ORGANIZATION> , which thecity has owned for four decades , and turn it into a small-scale homelessshelter.D.C . 
Council member <PERSON>Muriel Bowser</PERSON> ( D-Ward 4 ) , who is now running for mayor , helped block that plan , complaining , along with her constituents , that therewere too many group homes in the neighborhood and arguing that one more wouldharm property values.Huh . 
N Street Village is near booming 14th Street and has n't hurt propertyvalues , which have been soaring in recent years.The city is flush with cash and owns more property than the most megalomaniacalMonopoly player ever . 
Take a look at the city 's Web site and check out how muchland the <LOCATION>District</LOCATION> holds . 
It 's astonishing . 
Or look at the <ORGANIZATION>D.C. Vacant Propertiesblog</ORGANIZATION> and try to believe the resources are n't there to turn the affordablehousing crisis around.It costs the city <MONEY>$ 50,000</MONEY> a year to house one family at <ORGANIZATION>D.C. General</ORGANIZATION> , in a placethat does unspeakable damage to children and families that we will see echoed inawful ways for years to come.It 's time for a solid plan and a firm date to shut down the District 's shamefulshelter and begin using the city 's money and property to build smaller sheltersthat will rebuild - not break down - struggling families.All we need is the will.petula.dvorak@washpost.comTwitter: @petulad Ã¯ ...
