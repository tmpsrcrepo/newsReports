As undercover assignments go , posing as a teenage girl online to catchpedophiles has its share of challenges for the typical <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agent.Should he ever capitalize words in instant messages?Is it okay to say you buy your clothes at 5-7-9 ? 
And what about <PERSON>Justin Timberlake</PERSON> ? 
Is he still hot or is he so two years ago?For those investigative details , the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> calls on <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> , <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kristin</PERSON> -- <ORGANIZATION>Howard County</ORGANIZATION> eighth-graders and best friends.During the past year , the three have been teaching agents across the country howto communicate just like teenage girls , complete with written quizzes oncelebrity gossip and clothing trends and assigned reading in Teen People and YMmagazines . 
The first time the girls gave a quiz , all the agents failed . 
" They , like , do n't know anything , " said <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> , 14 , giggling . 
" They 're , like , do you like <PERSON>Michael Jackson</PERSON> ? " 
said <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> , 14 , rolling her eyesat just how out of it adults can be.Probably the youngest instructors ever in an <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> classroom , the girls havebecome an invaluable help to Operation Innocent Images -- an initiative thattries to stop people from peddling child pornography or otherwise sexuallyexploiting children , <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> officials said . 
The <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post agreed to withholdthe girls ' last names to protect them from harassment on the Internet andelsewhere.Yesterday , at their middle school graduation ceremony , the girls each received asilver-framed letter of commendation signed by <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON>Robert S. MuellerIII</PERSON> . 
In the letter , <PERSON>Mueller</PERSON> thanked them for developing the lessons that havedirectly helped catch pedophiles , despite their " busy 8th grade schedule . 
" Operation Innocent Images was launched by the <ORGANIZATION>Baltimore FBI</ORGANIZATION> field office in1995 , and agents looked into 113 suspects in the first year . 
Over the years , Internet pedophiles have become savvier and more suspicious about whether theyare chatting with a law enforcement agent or a real teenager . 
Many of thesuspects question the chatters on trends and pop culture , trying to catch theFBI agents off guard.Karen , <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kristin</PERSON> -- honor roll students , <ORGANIZATION>PacSun</ORGANIZATION> shoppers and aficionadosof pink toenail polish -- have kept the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> a step ahead , said <PERSON>Gary M. Bald</PERSON> , special agent in charge of the <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> office.The girls were recruited after one of their fathers , an agent involved in thepedophile investigations , watched her instant messaging a friend and could n'tunderstand what she was typing . 
He realized that <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> training was n't enough . 
" We can teach agents how to be careful and make sure they 're following the lawand how to arrest people , " <PERSON>Bald</PERSON> said . 
" But how to convince people they 're a13-year-old is something we need help on . 
" Agents estimate that at any given time , 20,000 pedophiles are online worldwide , trolling chat rooms after school hours for vulnerable teenagers . 
About two dozenagents and analysts handle such cases in the <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> region , working from computer cubicles in a <LOCATION>Calverton</LOCATION> office building . 
The program hasled to the convictions of about 2,200 people across the country for swappingchild pornography or arranging to meet minors for sex.Around the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> offices , <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> , <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kristin</PERSON> have become like the agents ' adopted daughters , getting hugs and high-fives from their students . 
Butnaturally , the adults often think they know best.One agent kept insisting that he was right when he answered on a quiz thatJustin <PERSON>Timberlake</PERSON> was more popular than <ORGANIZATION>Destiny</ORGANIZATION> 's Child . 
Another was miffed whenthe girls told the class that Led Zeppelin was just not cool . 
Some keptwondering why " l2m " in instant messaging could n't be " love to meet , " instead of " listen to music . 
" And the younger female <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> agents assumed that teenage girls would think actorGeorge <PERSON>Clooney</PERSON> is cute . 
" We 're , like , no , " said <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> , making a face . 
" He 's , like , 50 , " <PERSON>Karen exclaimed.In</PERSON> a couple of years , the girls will be too old to teach the classes and the FBImay find other teenagers to take their place . 
But the girls say they areinterested in continuing in law enforcement . 
Karen wants to be a forensicinvestigator . 
Mary thinks being a lawyer would be fun , " to put the bad guys injail . " 
And <PERSON>Kristin</PERSON> , 13 , the quiet one , says she 'll write about their exploits.Most of their classmates did not know about their <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> work until yesterday , whenBald commended them on their achievements . 
Thanks to the girls , <PERSON>Bald</PERSON> said , theFBI has gathered such valuable information as : never begin a chat with " hello " ; never use proper grammar in instant messages ; and " pos " stands for " parent overshoulder . 
" After the ceremony , several parents talked excitedly about finally finding outwhat " pos " meant.Karen shot Mary a worried look : " Our classmates are going to kill us . 
" Supervisory Special Agent <PERSON>Stacey Bradley</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> will answer questions aboutlaw enforcement efforts to combat Internet child pornography and exploitationand how to protect children who go online at <TIME>3 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> at www.washingtonpost.com/liveonline .
