Dear Carolyn : Boyfriend and I have been going out for more than a year . 
I think he iswonderful and well-meaning but uses guilt to try to control me . 
I would like tobreak it off , but previous attempts have led to more phone calls , e-mails andhis showing up unannounced ( going so far as to drive eight hours to appear at myparents ' house ) , and last time he punched a hole in the dashboard of my car . 
Ido n't think he would stoop to hitting me , but the harassment sure does feel likepsychological abuse.Complicating factors : I live with him , sometimes accept financial help from him , and we have the same core of close friends with whom I 'm not willing to partways . 
I also have had serious problems with depression when we 've broken up inthe past . 
I 'd like some help working up the courage to make the break . 
Giventhat this is not physical abuse , I do n't know about going to a battered-women ' sgroup . 
-- M.won ' der-ful adj. causes wonder.I wonder when harassment became " well-meaning . 
" I wonder when he 'll upgrade from automotive violence to domestic violence.I wonder if you realize that the best thing you can do for your courage and yourmental health is to stop hiding behind money , friends and house keys and starttaking better care of yourself.Call 1-800-799-SAFE , get referrals to a local domestic-abuse center as well as agood therapist , and get out , get out , get out.Not the word I would have chosen , but , you 're right , what a wonderful guy.Dear Carolyn : I was interested in a friendly assistant at my pets ' vet . 
Yesterday I called andasked if she was single ( yes ) , and would she like to meet for lunch . 
Sheaccepted , then said she had to go to attend to a client but would call me back.She never did ; I figured she was n't interested and that was that.Today I received in the mail a very nice note , dated BEFORE I asked her out.What gives ? 
Did she think I should call her back even though she said she wouldcall me ? 
Did she accept only because I caught her off-guard at the office , andsaw non-callback as the easiest escape ? 
Then why the personal note ? 
What lessoncan I draw for future date propositions ? 
The episode makes me think that women , like <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> ( to borrow from <LOCATION>Churchill</LOCATION> ) , are a riddle wrapped in a mystery insidean enigma . 
-- Blown Off in <LOCATION>New JerseyMaking</LOCATION> sure I 've got this straight : You liked her , and called her . 
She , apparently , liked you , and wrote you a note . 
You agreed to meet for lunch.Speaking of riddles wearing enigma suits , one just sat on my desk : Why have n'tyou just called her back?Carolyn : My old college roommate and I parted on very bad terms ( or I think so , since wewere n't exactly speaking ) . 
At the time , I did n't realize how bitchy I was ; Ihave to say , though , she was pretty bitchy , too . 
Now I keep thinking aboutlooking her up to apologize and maybe just to see how she 's doing . 
It 's hard toget objective advice from my other friends because they are biased against her , having now heard years of nasty stories about her . 
What do you think ? 
Look herup ? 
Or do her and me a favor and let it go ? 
-- Unable to Be ObjectiveIn the time you 've spent undertaking microscopic group analysis of the fibers ofthis issue , you could have looked her up , called her , apologized , caught up , enjoyed or regretted your decision , picked up your dry cleaning , waxed your carand , if you 're anything but completely inept in the kitchen , thrown together ahalfway decent red sauce.Carolyn : Which do you think is more important for couple-happiness : sharedbackground/interests/points of view , or depth of feeling and ability/willingnessto communicate ? 
-- Mistakes Were MadeYes.Did those " mistakes " involve settling?Carolyn : I need some guidelines for dating a good friend 's ex-girlfriend . 
He broke upwith her about a year ago after two years of dating . 
They do n't talk anymore.Will I definitely ruin my friendship with him ? 
Should I ask his permission?Should I talk with her about him ? 
-- D.L.Can I borrow my sister 's pants?Why am I asking you?Your friend will know how he feels about your wooing his estranged . 
Peopleare n't possessions , so " permission " is icky on principle -- but telling him thatyou wanted to be the one to tell him you were going to ask her out , in case hehad any objections , is a great way to ask without asking . 
Besides , there 's neverany harm in hearing somebody out , especially a good friend -- especially a goodfriend who stays when girls come and go -- and objections are sometimes legit.Write to Tell Me About It , Style Plus , <DATE>1150</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>15th St. NW</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> 20071or tellme@washpost.com, and join <PERSON>Carolyn</PERSON> 's live discussion at noon <DATE>Fridays</DATE> or 3p .
