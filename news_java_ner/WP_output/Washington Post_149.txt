The fact that The Post and washingtonpost.com are interlocking yet separate islost on most readers , who do not care that the two are miles apart physicallyand under different management.A great example is the recent firestorm over a column that never appeared inThe Post -- but for which The Post was blamed . 
<PERSON>William M. Arkin</PERSON> , who writesan online national security column and blog called " Early Warning , " was criticalof soldiers who , in an NBC-TV report , voiced their frustration with oppositionto the war . 
The report , he wrote , " is just an ugly reminder of the price we payfor a mercenary -- oops sorry , volunteer -- force . 
" He also wrote : " These soldiers should be grateful that the American public , which by all polls overwhelmingly disapproves of the <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> war and thePresident 's handling of it , do still offer their support to them , and theirrespect . 
Through every <PERSON>Abu Ghraib</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Haditha</LOCATION> , through every rape and murder , the American public has indulged those in uniform , accepting that the incidentswere the product of bad apples or even of some administration or command order . 
" I 'm all for everyone expressing their opinion , even those who wear the uniformof the <ORGANIZATION>United States Army</ORGANIZATION> . 
But I also hope that military commanders took thesoldiers aside after the story and explained to them why it was n't for them todisapprove of the American people . 
" Complaints were swift and angry and came by the thousands . 
<PERSON>D.J. Aland</PERSON> ofSpringfield wrote : " Mr. <PERSON>Arkin</PERSON> 's hateful and hate-filled tantrum on theWashington Post Web site , in which he calls American soldiers ' mercenary ' andridicules their opinions , is beyond definition . 
His column stains yourpublication -- not as much for his opinion as for the vile way he hasexpressed it . 
The credibility of the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post national security reportingis irreparably damaged by his ranting . 
" Did one online column irreparably damage Post national security journalism ? 
No.But it does show that an online column rubs off on the newspaper . 
Opinions onArkin vary among Post reporters who write about the military and nationalsecurity . 
Some respect him ; others think he harms The Post 's reputation.Arkin is no rookie . 
A national security and human rights fellow at <ORGANIZATION>HarvardUniversity 's Kennedy School of Government</ORGANIZATION> , he has written books , spoken at thearmed services ' war colleges , and been a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> and humanrights and environmental groups . 
He is a military analyst for <ORGANIZATION>NBC-TV</ORGANIZATION> and hasbroken national stories . 
" What makes me successful is that . . . I write a blog , and a blog is a highlypersonal venture , " he said . 
" If I try to do it without a voice and without mysarcasm and without my digs and without my crazy lens , then no one would readit . 
" Bloggers thrive on their opinions . 
Many newspaper journalists , often attackedby bloggers , think they are the " real " journalists , working in a parallel andbetter journalistic universe.I 'm sure journalists at <LOCATION>washingtonpost.com</LOCATION> see their work as the journalism ofthe future , while we of the dead-tree format can be seen as the past . 
Arkinsaid that " newspaper reporters would try to wipe me off the bottom of theirshoes . . . if they acknowledge [ bloggers ' ] existence . 
" Arkin apologized . 
He said he was " dead wrong " to use the word " mercenary , " thatit " is an insult and pejorative , and it does not accurately describe thecondition of the American soldier today . 
I sincerely apologize to anyone in themilitary who took my words literally . 
" Readers usually take things literally . 
And an editor should have told him totake out the word . 
That 's what editors are for : They keep opinion writers frommaking fools of themselves.Arkin is unrepentant about two things : He works for The Post . 
Period . 
And hesaid he is " probably one of the best-known and respected anti-military militarybloggers . 
" An editor read his column before it was posted but did n't see the problem . 
JimBrady , <LOCATION>washingtonpost.com</LOCATION> 's executive editor , said that had he seen it , he wouldhave asked for changes . 
Arkin said he would have made them.What 's the difference between opinion writing for the newspaper and forwashingtonpost.com ? 
The writing can be similar , but the editing is more intenseat the newspaper . 
More experienced eyes see a story or a column before it goesinto the paper ; The Post has several levels of rigorous editing . 
There is " lessof an editing process " for blogs at the more immediacy-oriented Web site , Bradysaid.Several Post reporters also blog on <LOCATION>washingtonpost.com</LOCATION> . 
One is <PERSON>Joel Achenbach</PERSON> , who said blogging is like dealing with " live ammo . 
The blog software is a verypowerful weapon . 
You can publish something very quickly under the name of <ORGANIZATION>TheWashington Post</ORGANIZATION> . 
You need a steady hand and good judgment . 
" Software allows writers to post with a delay for editors to raise questions.Brady said : " We do edit almost all blogs . 
Usually , it 's pre-publication . 
Sometimes -- like when live-blogging a hearing or a Redskins game -- we ' lledit live . " 
Blogs are held to the same standards as any Post journalism , hesaid.Arkin 's column did not meet Post standards , but then , newspaper editing is n'tperfect , either . 
But " mercenary " surely is live ammo ; such an incendiary wordshould have popped out in flames to Post editors.And it is good editing that should prevail when a report carries The Post ' sbanner.Deborah <PERSON>Howell</PERSON> can be reached at 202-334-7582 or at ombudsman@washpost.com .
