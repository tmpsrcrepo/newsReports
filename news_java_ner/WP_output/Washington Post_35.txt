A young man follows a teenage girl along a street in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> 's capital on a recentmuggy morning , leering . 
The girl , wearing jeans topped with a long tunic , quickens her steps . 
As the man closes in , she covers her mouth with her hands.Bystanders cover their eyes.Then everybody freezes in place.The two had just acted out the first scene of a street play about sexualharassment and social acquiescence that Indian university students have beenperforming across the city as part of the run-up to <ORGANIZATION>SlutWalk Delhi</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> ' sversion of the campus campaign that began in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> in <DATE>April</DATE> and has sincespread to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> and the UnitedStates.The walk , designed as a protest against a Canadian police officer who advisedwomen to " avoid dressing like sluts " if they want to be safe from sexualassault , has elsewhere involved women dressing as provocatively as they please.But in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> , the SlutWalk set for this coming <DATE>Sunday</DATE> is getting a makeover , with student organizers saying they have tweaked the original concept to bettermatch <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> 's conservative social palette.The confrontational " slut " has been softened by adding the Hindi word for " shamelessness " to the event 's title . 
Women have been asked to march in theirregular clothes . 
And weekly public debates and street theater are being promotedeven more energetically than the walk itself.Rather than focusing on clothes , the campaign is questioning gender stereotypesembedded in ancient Hindu religious epics , Bollywood movies and sexistmatrimonial classified ads . 
" There will be no dress code " for the march , said <PERSON>Umang Sabarwal</PERSON> , 19 , theevent 's chief organizer . 
" In <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> , no matter what we wear , even if we arecovered head to toe in a sari or a burqa , we get molested and raped . 
A woman ' sfight in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is more basic - it is a fight for the right to be born , education , nutritious food , work . 
" <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> , a city of about 16.7 million , has reported 258 cases of rape ormolestation through <DATE>June this year</DATE> , and women in the city routinelyfaceharassment in buses and on the metro system . 
<ORGANIZATION>SlutWalk Delhi</ORGANIZATION> has Twitter andFacebook accounts , but in an effort to be more inclusive , march organizers havealso begun distributing pamphlets , titled " Speak Up , " to women in thecityhttp : / / www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/25/AR2010112503548.html . 
" We want to reach a larger audience , beyond the campus and the Facebook crowd , " said <PERSON>Mishika Singh</PERSON> , 20 , a law student and a walk coordinator.The young English-speaking students also find themselves having to work hard tosecure the backing of an older generation of feminists who prefer to be moreculturally rooted . 
When they approached the government-run <ORGANIZATION>National Commissionfor Women</ORGANIZATION> and other women 's organizations for funding and support , they wererebuffed . 
" I agree with the cause , but the packaging is wrong , " said <PERSON>Ranjana Kumari</PERSON> , aleading feminist who heads the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Social Research</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I tried to counselthe students not to alienate the majority of Indian women . 
The Indian feministmovement took many decades to recover from the damage caused by the Americanbra-tossing campaigns . 
Let us not ape the West unnecessarily and trivialize ourfight . 
" Still , <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is urbanizing rapidly and embracing global culture . 
Two-thirds ofthe country 's 1.2 billion people are younger than 35 , and many young women saythey are battling the same stereotypes as elsewhere.Shefalee Vasudev , a fashion columnist for the <ORGANIZATION>Indian Express</ORGANIZATION> newspaper , wrotethis month : " Damn the intellectuals . 
SlutWalk is actually about clothes , aboutwhat we wear and how . 
That 's why if we all turn up in ' decent clothes ' for theSlutWalk , we may not be able to make the point . 
" Amid rising crime against women , the city 's police commissioner offered someadvice last week . 
" You ca n't travel alone at <TIME>2 a.m.</TIME> and then say <LOCATION>Delhi</LOCATION> is notsafe , " <PERSON>B.K. Gupta</PERSON> said . 
" It would be ideal if a woman takes her brother ordriver along . 
" Two years ago , a young woman was killed while going home late from work . 
Delhi ' schief minister , <PERSON>Sheila Dikshit</PERSON> , caused a public outcry at the time when she saidthat women should not be " adventurous . 
" <PERSON>Prateeka Nanda</PERSON> , 19 , an undergraduate volunteer , said : " We hear such advice allthe time from our parents . 
The restrictions are always put on women , never onthe men . 
Men do not own the public space . 
We want to reclaim it . 
" Last <DATE>Sunday</DATE> , the central Indian town of <LOCATION>Bhopal</LOCATION> was the scene of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> 's firstSlutWalk . 
Only 50 people showed up . 
The organizers said parents did not allowtheir daughters to participate.lakshmir@washpost.com
