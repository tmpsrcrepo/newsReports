There 's a point in the new documentary " Anita " at which Sen. <PERSON>Howell Heflin</PERSON> isquestioning Anita Hill . 
" In trying to determine whether you are telling falsehoods or not , I 've got todetermine what your motivation might be , " the <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> Democrat said duringHill 's <DATE>1991</DATE> testimony before the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> , concerning hersexual harassment allegations against <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON>Clarence Thomas</PERSON> . 
" Are you a scorned woman ? 
Do you have a martyr complex ? 
Do you see yourselfcoming out of this as a hero in the civil rights movement ? 
" Hill , as composed as ever , answered calmly : " No . 
" Imagine if a male member of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> tried <PERSON>Heflin</PERSON> 's approach now : FeministTwitter would nail him to the wall . 
There would be countless think pieces aboutinstitutionalized sexism . 
One envisions <PERSON>Amy Klobuchar</PERSON> , <PERSON>Dianne Feinstein</PERSON> andMazie <PERSON>Hirono</PERSON> ( all current members of that <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> committee ) initiating the sortof withering , civilized takedown that would spike C-Span ratings and make " DailyShow " writers whoop with glee.Maybe that 's a measure of how far we 've come in the 23 years since Hilltestified against her former <ORGANIZATION>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</ORGANIZATION> colleague . 
" Anita , " which premiered at Sundance and opens <DATE>Friday</DATE> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , states thatHill was essentially put on trial , even though the hearings were supposed to bean examination of <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> 's character after President <PERSON>George H.W. Bush</PERSON> nominatedhim to the court . 
Her credibility was impugned , and there was innuendosuggesting that she was just seeking romantic revenge against Thomas.To a new generation of women , in the age of such Web outlets as Feministing , Feministe and <ORGANIZATION>Black Girl Dangerous</ORGANIZATION> , that is dumbfounding . 
Many may look at thescreen and think of <PERSON>Heflin</PERSON> : " He ca n't be serious . 
" Turns out , he was n't , entirely . 
" There are different ways to see what <PERSON>Howell Heflin</PERSON> was trying to accomplish , " Hill said in a phone interview from her <ORGANIZATION>Brandeis University</ORGANIZATION> office . 
" He wasreally preempting things from being asked by people in a more hostile way . 
" <PERSON>Heflin</PERSON> , who died in <DATE>2005</DATE> , and Hill knew it was ridiculous , yet there was noescaping it . 
" These were things that were being said out there , " <PERSON>Hill</PERSON> said . 
" And I do believemaybe it was n't the most artful way of doing it , but he was giving me a chanceto respond to those things [ in a way less confrontational than what ] the hostilepeople and the accusatory people might be doing later on had he not raised thequestion . 
It 's a technique that was lost on us at the time . 
There was just somuch hostility and so much seeming disconnect between our experiences and ourlives , and what they seemed to be able to understand and comprehend . 
" Hill , a college law professor , was subjected to a round of media slut-shaming sointense that it spawned a bestselling book , " The Real Anita Hill , " by AmericanSpectator writer <PERSON>David Brock</PERSON> . 
It was <PERSON>Brock</PERSON> who coined the phrase " a little bitnutty and a little bit slutty " to discredit Hill . 
He later founded <ORGANIZATION>Media Mattersfor America</ORGANIZATION> , a liberal media watchdog group . 
He has since recanted what he wroteand publicly apologized in his book " Blinded by the Right . 
" Hill was the target not just of hate mail and death threats but also of theverbal tactics of the all-male <ORGANIZATION>Judiciary Committee</ORGANIZATION> , whose members apparentlydid n't understand what it meant to be sexually harassed . 
" Sen. [ Arlen ] Specter , he took an adversarial role , " Hill says in the film , referring to the late <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> lawmaker . 
" It was clear Specter had come inwith a closed mind . 
" What 's so different from <DATE>1991</DATE> ? 
Women still have n't achieved parity in most ofAmerican politics . 
They account for <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and roughly 18percent of the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> . 
And attitudes toward such issues assexual harassment and sexual assault have improved in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , butinstitutions - including the military and some college campuses - still failwhen it comes to protecting women.Consider that <PERSON>Jessica Valenti</PERSON> , founder of Feministing , still has to explain whyit 's important to identify rape culture when <PERSON>RAINN</PERSON> , the nation 's largestadvocacy group for rape victims , recently told the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> that rape culturedoes n't exist.In a more subtle but no less frustrating case , a report by lawyers for NewJersey Gov. <PERSON>Chris Christie</PERSON> blamed the " Bridgegate " scandal on former deputychief of staff <PERSON>Bridget Anne Kelly</PERSON> 's lack of judgment because she 'd been dumpedby his campaign manager , <PERSON>Bill Stepien.In</PERSON> some ways , the atmosphere is as adversarial as ever . 
Take the case of <ORGANIZATION>ArmyBrig</ORGANIZATION> . 
Gen. <PERSON>Jeffrey Sinclair</PERSON> , who received no jail time after he was accused ofsexual assault and convicted of sexual misconduct . 
Rep. <PERSON>Jackie Speier</PERSON> ( D-Calif . ) 
called the verdict a " mockery of military justice . " 
" I think one of the things that was so disheartening to people in <DATE>1991</DATE> is thatthe <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> just did n't seem to take the issue of sexual harassment seriously atall , " <PERSON>Hill</PERSON> said . 
" They did n't take it seriously on how it reflected on thecharacter of a person , especially a person who was going to be judging thesekinds of claims . 
But they did seem to be very dismissive of women ' sexperiences . " 
" The General <PERSON>Sinclair</PERSON> situation makes me understand , specifically , how importantprocess is . 
The process that he was tried under has certainly been held up to alot of scrutiny , " Hill continues . 
" Process really matters , and I think a lot ofpeople , the public , believe the process failed . 
I think that 's critical for us . 
" This film is n't a critical look at what 's wrong with <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> , or even theprogress that 's been made when it comes to workplace policies and how theyaffect women . 
It 's a story about Hill , what happened in <DATE>1991</DATE> , and why shedecided to come forward . 
It 's a statement that suggests that while Hill may havelost the initial battle , she - and all opponents of sexism - are winning thewar.soraya.mcdonald@washpost.com " Anita " director Freida Mock will appear for Q&A sessions after 7:15 p.m.screenings <DATE>Friday</DATE> and <DATE>Saturday</DATE> at <ORGANIZATION>E Street Cinema</ORGANIZATION> .
