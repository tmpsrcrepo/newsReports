' Met Your Mother , ' 9.0 <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> was finally able <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> to make it official : " How I Met Your Mother " iscoming back for one , final - and this time they mean it - season.All series regulars - <PERSON>Josh Radnor</PERSON> , <PERSON>Jason Segel</PERSON> , <PERSON>Cobie Smulders</PERSON> , <PERSON>Neil PatrickHarris</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alyson Hannigan</PERSON> , and show creators <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> Bays and <PERSON>Craig Thomas</PERSON> - will be back for a ninth season , at the end of which , <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> swears , thedad/narrator will reveal ( while telling the longest of bedtime stories ) who momis in this narrative.Not that it matters , because dad 's kids were , several seasons ago , doomed toyears of therapy . 
Because let 's face it : Over its nearly eight seasons to date , Dad has been something of a hound dog , and do n't even get us started on the momcandidates.Speaking to TV critics several weeks ago at <ORGANIZATION>Winter TV Press Tour</ORGANIZATION> 2013 inPasadena , <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> programming chief <PERSON>Nina Tassler</PERSON> warned that a ninth-seasonannouncement was imminent.Squeezing a ninth season out of this sitcom was a priority for <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> . 
Despite allthe " long in the tooth " blah , blah , blah from The Reporters Who CoverTelevision , " HIMYM " last season ( its seventh ) scored its best numbers ever amongviewers ( nearly 10 million of them ) , as well as in the 18-to-49-year-old and18-to-34-year-old viewer demographics . 
Most important , " HIMYM " has the youngestmedian age of any <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> series : 44.2 years.Returning " HIMYM " became even more important to <ORGANIZATION>CBS</ORGANIZATION> this <DATE>fall</DATE> when the freshmanMonday comedy " Partners " crashed and burned early , and the network 's midseasoncomedy " Friend Me " plunged into limbo with the death of one of its co-creators .

And that the <DATE>Jan. 24</DATE> interviewwith Te'o and his parents scored <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> bigger ratings than the show 's priorfour-week average.Sadly , " Katie 's " original exec producer , <PERSON>Jeff Zucker</PERSON> , has departed to go shakethings up at <ORGANIZATION>CNN</ORGANIZATION> , and <PERSON>Michael Morrison</PERSON> joined late last month.And in other Te'o news : <PERSON>Roniah Tuiasosopo</PERSON> , the guy behind Fake <PERSON>Lennay Kekua</PERSON> , will bare all to Oprah protege Dr. <PERSON>Phil</PERSON> on his daytime talker <DATE>Thursday</DATE> andFriday .
