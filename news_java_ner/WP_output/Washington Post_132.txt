<PERSON>Graham Spanier</PERSON> may have been ousted from his post as <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> president overthe sex-abuse scandal that engulfed the university , but it seems he 's found abackup employer : the American taxpayer.Spanier was faulted in an internal <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> report after former assistantfootball coach <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky</PERSON> was convicted of child molestationhttp : / / www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/documents/sandusky-grand-jury-report11052011.html . 
The reportsaid that <PERSON>Spanier</PERSON> , head coach <PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> and others helped cover up <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> ' sabuse.His attorney confirms to the <LOCATION>Loop</LOCATION> that <PERSON>Spanier</PERSON> is working as a part-timeconsultant for a " top-secret " agency on national security issues . 
But the gig isso hush-hush , he could n't even tell his attorneys the name of the agency.In <DATE>April</DATE> - months after his ouster as president but before the release of theinternal report - he told the Patriot-News of central <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> that he wasworking on a " special project for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government relating [ to ] nationalsecurity . 
" But who 's he working for ? 
The <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> ? 
Homeland Security ? 
A consulting firm with agovernment contract ? 
" I have no idea , " said his attorney , <PERSON>Peter Vaira</PERSON> . 
" We know the work is insecurity and he 's prohibited from disclosing which agency or agencies he ' sworking for . 
" After the internal report - by former <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON>Louis Freeh</PERSON> - was released , <PERSON>Spanier</PERSON> complained ina statement from his attorneys that the document did n'tmention his government clearance - something he apparently thought was evidenceof his trustworthiness . 
He noted that his security clearance ( which heapparently had obtained while still at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> ) " required a re-review whenthe <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> matter surfaced in <DATE>November</DATE> " and that federal investigatorsconducted their own probe of his role in the scandal . 
The federal investigationended with his clearance being " reaffirmed , " the statement read.The <ORGANIZATION>Office of Personnel Management</ORGANIZATION> , essentially the federal government 's humanresources department , did n't shed any light on <PERSON>Spanier</PERSON> 's mysterious gig as apossible federal employee . 
They instructed us to call individual agencies , eventhough we pointed out that we did n't know which agencies to contact.Have you spotted <PERSON>Spanier</PERSON> , sporting a government ID on a lanyard , and perhapscarrying a brown-bag lunch ?

We ask personal questions without batting aneyelash , stake out private meetings with impunity and make general nuisances ofourselves.But there are some thresholds even most journos wo n't cross in pursuit of astory - like the bathroom door.Last night , one reporter 's zeal to get a quote from Rep. <PERSON>David Dreier</PERSON> ( R-Calif . ) 
led her into verboten territory : the men 's room off the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> floor.Dreier apparently decided to play a little prank on the ( female ) reporters whowere chasing him and pressing him for details about a possible emergency meetingof the <ORGANIZATION>Rules Committee</ORGANIZATION> , the panel he chairs.Upon reaching the door to the loo , he playfully swung it open and jokingly saidsomething to the effect of " Come on in - we 'll talk about it . 
" CQ reporter <PERSON>Rachael Bade</PERSON> assumed the door led to a private room and took a fewsteps in , not understanding why other reporters were n't following . 
She quicklyrealized her error and made a hasty about-face , but she took it all in stride . 
" I totally fell for his little trap , " she tells us . 
" Everyone was laughing .

" Yet our own <ORGANIZATION>Department of Agriculture</ORGANIZATION> is encouraging people not to eat meat . 
" A department official promptly sent an e-mail to <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> staff : " I wanted to besure you had the following statement regarding the claims that <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> is promoting ' Meatless Mondays , ' " she wrote .

" We are holding an Olympic Games in one of the busiest , most active , bustlingcities anywhere in the world , " he said .
