The good news is , we 're talking about it . 
The bad news is , we 're talking aboutit . 
Again.The high-profile cases of sexual assault in the military just keep on coming.And along with them comes the stunningly retro way in which they are handled.Our latest example comes from the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Naval Academy</ORGANIZATION> , which confirmed Fridaythat it is investigating three academy football players in connection with thesexual assault of one of their classmates.The midshipman was already drunk when she went to an off-campus party at a placeknown as " the football house . " 
She drank until she blacked out , then woke upcovered in bruises.She did n't tell anyone what happened . 
A recent <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> report estimated thatabout 26,000 military members were victims of unwanted sexual contact last year , and most of those episodes go unreported.Why ? 
The victim often winds up getting blamed - and pilloried . 
Do n't believe me?Just read through the comments on the story , where you 'll encounter epicmisogyny , and lots of people who still do n't want women in the military . 
Onecommenter said that " rape will be the least of her problems " if the midshipmanwere to ever get captured.But she was n't in enemy hands . 
Or so she thought.At first , she did n't even know what happened . 
But soon enough , the campus wascrackling with rumors , fueled by online Facebook brags about the assault . 
" She learned from friends and social media that three football players wereclaiming to have had sexual intercourse with her while she was incapacitated , " her attorney , <PERSON>Susan Burke</PERSON> , said in a statement.So this latest scandal merges two of the big trends in sexual assault today - the military and social media confessionals.Yup , the men we are training to be the future leaders of one of the world 's mostformidable military machines are not only accused of allegedly assaulting one oftheir fellow officers when they found her vulnerable ( what about all thoseheroic stories of never leaving anyone behind ? ) 
, but then they allegedly braggedabout it online.Great . 
Give these guys top secret military plans , see how long before they hitTwitter with a #callofdutyreallife ! 
hashtag.What 's even more appalling is the way these assaults are being handled . 
ThisAnnapolis incident happened more than a year ago . 
Since then , the woman has beenpunished for drinking . 
What did the guys get ? 
Nada.The woman was required - according to academy rules - to attend all of thefootball games these guys were playing in . 
These are the guys who did n't evenget a slap on the wrist for drinking while an investigation is pending . 
Andpending . 
And pending.Football players seem to get a lot of slack at the <ORGANIZATION>Naval</ORGANIZATION> Academy.In <DATE>2001</DATE> , three <ORGANIZATION>Naval Academy</ORGANIZATION> football players withdrew from the academy ratherthan face criminal charges from the locals for allegedly raping one of theirclassmates at an off-campus drinking party at a parent 's waterfront home.Last year , <PERSON>Annie Kendzior</PERSON> went public with her horror story when she filed alawsuit - again with the help of attorney <PERSON>Burke</PERSON> - against the academy for anassault during her plebe <DATE>summer</DATE> in <DATE>2007</DATE> . 
She went to a lacrosse party , got drunkand went into a back room to sleep it off on an air mattress . 
She woke up withone of her classmates on top of her , raping her.Kendzior filed that suit along with a West Point student , <PERSON>Karley Marquet</PERSON> ofPennsylvania . 
<PERSON>Marquet</PERSON> said she was raped in <DATE>2011</DATE> , when an upperclassman took herto a room and they were both drinking , then he assaulted her.Lots of people blame the victims instead of the perpetrators . 
They weredrinking , they were with guys . 
What could you expect?Here 's what I expect : that our best and brightest , our future officers - theguys who will have to make crucial life-and-death decisions in an increasinglycomplex world - would not rape a colleague .
