I.Freetown : The Abduction of HelenAlpha heard banging at the gates of his family 's compound , then gunshots . 
Helooked out a second-story window and saw the rebels . 
Some wore the combatcamouflage of <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> 's disintegrated army . 
Some wore black jeans , knitpolo shirts , <ORGANIZATION>Tupac Shakur</ORGANIZATION> T-shirts . 
A few had wrapped their hair inhandkerchiefs patterned with the American flag . 
All of them wore red bandannasaround their foreheads . 
Adhesive strips patched their faces , as if they had beenscratched by angry cats . 
The strips masked incisions where the rebels hadingested cocaine , amphetamines or other drugs that wired their heads for battle.In eastern <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> on <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> , <DATE>January 18 , 1999</DATE> , a war that was at thatmoment the world 's cruelest , as well as its most invisible , entered the parlorof the <PERSON>Jalloh</PERSON> family , where breakfast lay unfinished on a table in the center ofthe room . 
It was not easy to say why the rebels entered one house and notanother , but a faint air of prosperity hung over this gated compound on KissyRoad . 
<PERSON>Dalibeh Jalloh</PERSON> 's nine children by two wives included the three sweet-facedsons now standing frightened by the window . 
The oldest was Alpha , 22 , who tradedgold-plated watches he bought in <LOCATION>Guinea</LOCATION> , had a girlfriend , danced in <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> ' snightclubs , and who now listened as the rebels crashed through the last door andclimbed the stairs.They demanded money and <ORGANIZATION>Alpha</ORGANIZATION> 's father handed over bundles . 
Gun barrels swung tothe three brothers . 
A rebel commander ordered them outside . 
Their mother sat ina chair before the unfinished food and wept . 
Their father begged : " Please do n'ttake them . 
They are my children . 
Do n't take them . 
" Outside , the rebels forced them into line . 
They marched up a red clay road pastsmall shacks and shops toward green , grassy hills . 
" We are going back to the bush , " a rebel taunted , " but we are leaving somethingwith you . 
" The brothers began to cry . 
The line of youths swelled with other abductees asthey walked . 
Some rebels told the boys their hands would be cut off and sentback to the democratically elected president of <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Ahmad TejanKabbah</PERSON> , as a symbol of the rebels ' power . 
Others said the boys would be killed.The <PERSON>Jalloh</PERSON> brothers begged to be taken to the rain forest , where they could beindoctrinated as rebels and join the " revolution . " 
" No , we are sending you to <PERSON>Tejan Kabbah</PERSON> . 
We are not taking you to the jungle . 
" Two hundred yards up the slope they reached a school driveway . 
Before a metalgate stood a tall , thin rebel wearing black jeans , a black T-shirt and a redbandanna . 
Drug strips covered his face . 
The others called him <PERSON>Tommy</PERSON> . 
He held anaxe.A neighbor the boys knew as Sheikou went first . 
As rebels trained assault riflesat his head , he stretched on his stomach on broken concrete before the schoolgate and extended his arm.Tommy raised the axe high above his head and slammed it down . 
Once , twice , threetimes , four times . 
Sheikou 's severed hand seemed to jump away from him.The line shuffled forward . 
Alpha , weeping and shaking , watched his youngerbrother Amadu , 17 , stretch out his right arm.As <PERSON>Tommy</PERSON> raised his axe , Alpha closed his eyes.Helen jolted awake . 
" We 've come ! " 
she heard the rebels shout . 
" You thought wewere not coming back to the city ! 
We 're here ! 
" It was three days later in a middle-class neighborhood up the slope from theschool gate , where the war would now force entry into the second-story apartmentof a salaried government bureaucrat and his 20-year-old daughter , Helen.Helen : an earnest student who radiates such energy and possesses such physicalbeauty that on the streets of some other capital , people might assume she wasfamous . 
She has a daughter by her boyfriend , <PERSON>Abdul</PERSON> . 
She lives at home in thewind-caressed suburban hills above <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> , where she lounges with her dotingfather , and sneaks away with <PERSON>Abdul</PERSON> , and thinks about going into business , as sheand her girlfriends have sometimes done in small ways , trading shampoo and foodfrom an old metal shipping container across from a Catholic church.Helen , who , like <ORGANIZATION>Alpha</ORGANIZATION> , belongs to a generation of young Africans whose parents ' ambitions have delivered them from rural poverty to urban aspiration . 
They havecome of age in a networked , electronic , globalized , syncretic era that for allits fractures manages to connect even to them . 
One world , ready or not , even inSierra <PERSON>Leone</PERSON> , which the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> describes as the poorest country in theworld . 
In <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> , the Atlantic-washed capital , there is not a regular supplyof electricity or a reliable telephone system , but inevitably , there is afunctioning cyber-cafe , and the streets pulse with battery-powered hip-hop musicand generator-operated satellite news and the buying power of Western Unionmoney transfers sent by the tens of thousands who have made it to <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> andAmerica . 
A progressive generation of young and ambitious Africans , you might sayadmiringly , except that besides <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> and Alpha , it also includes <PERSON>Tommy</PERSON> and hisnihilistic brethren -- acronym-happy ex-soldiers and self-styled revolutionarieswho roam and sprawl across the continent , armed with Chinese - and EastEuropean-manufactured assault rifles , propelled by grievance , greed and a broadexperience of impunity . 
" We are all internationalists now , whether we like it or not , " British PrimeMinister <PERSON>Tony Blair</PERSON> said <DATE>last year</DATE> , explaining why the world intervenedmilitarily to stop paramilitary bloodshed in <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION> ( as it would later in EastTimor ) . 
Expanding global trade , satellites , the World Wide Web and humanmigration have combined to create " the beginnings of a new doctrine ofinternational community , " one where " globalization is not just economic , it isalso a political and security phenomenon , " giving birth to a world where " wecannot turn our backs on conflicts and the violation of human rights withinother countries if we want still to be secure . " 
Acknowledging the obvious limitsof such a doctrine , however , <PERSON>Blair</PERSON> worried that " as yet . . . our approach tendstowards being ad hoc . 
" <PERSON>Blair</PERSON> sought to measure his millennial ideas by the world 's conduct in Kosovoduring the <DATE>last year of the 20th century</DATE> . 
But an African might want to measurethem against the world 's conduct in <LOCATION>Sierra Leone</LOCATION> during that same year of <DATE>1999</DATE> . 
A year when , on the night of <DATE>January 21</DATE> , eight weeks before the war began inKosovo , two rebels entered <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> 's suburban apartment , roughed up her father andtold him that they were taking away his daughter.He begged them to leave her alone . 
" If you keep complaining , we 're going to killyou , " one of the rebels said.The next morning , her parents watched <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> walk at gunpoint up the hill , through the mango trees , past the <ORGANIZATION>Kissy Mental Hospital</ORGANIZATION> , toward the peaks thatpointed to the country 's interior.Helen found herself walking with another girl from the neighborhood who had alsobeen abducted . 
The pair wept and begged to be released . 
" I am a school-going girl , " <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> said . 
" I do n't want to know , " replied her captor , whom she would come in the monthsahead to know as Colonel Bloodshed.The rebels took them into the grass and raped them . 
Then they pushed them ontoward camp.II.Dawa : A Borderless WorldAt the spot on the world 's maps where northwestern <LOCATION>Liberia</LOCATION> officially ends andeastern <PERSON>Sierra Leone</PERSON> begins lies a shell of broken concrete , the remains of asmall customs building burned in war . 
A village gate concocted from a tree trunkand rope marks the border crossing at <LOCATION>Dawa</LOCATION> . 
No government officials from eithercountry work here . 
There are only teenagers with assault rifles . 
They do notmuch care for passports or formalities.A man in a red beret steps briskly to our jeep and introduces himself as towncommander of the <ORGANIZATION>Revolutionary United Front</ORGANIZATION> , or <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Sierra Leone</PERSON> 's fearsomerebel army . 
Two other rebels crowd forward , announcing themselves as " ChuckNorris " and " Rambo . " 
Welcome , they declare sincerely.Behind us lies 30 hours of Liberian wonderland -- a sinkhole-filled , erodedjungle track that our <ORGANIZATION>Mitsubishi</ORGANIZATION> Pajero traversed at a bone-rattling , rock-slinging average of about 5 mph . 
A few miles ahead lies the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> 's baseheadquarters in the isolated rain forest town of Buedu . 
There we -- myself andWashington Post photography editor <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> duCille -- have been invited tointerview and photograph Sam " General Mosquito " <PERSON>Bockarie</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> 's militaryleader . 
As much as any other person , he will decide whether <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> beginsthe new century at war or peace . 
In getting to know the general , we hope tounravel some of the mystery and meaning of <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> 's violence.Our journey had begun six weeks earlier , over lunch at an elegant Frenchrestaurant in <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> . 
There I met a silver-haired <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> businessmannamed <PERSON>John Caldwell</PERSON> . 
He explained that he had been retained by the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> , alongwith a Belgian partner , to handle certain business affairs for the rebels , whoseterritory includes most of <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> 's coveted diamond mines . 
At my request , <PERSON>Caldwell</PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> for permission to travel to its base . 
The rebels agreed.They felt they suffered from poor public relations , in part because no Westernjournalists had ever visited their headquarters or traveled behind their lines.They wanted to convince the outside world that the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> was not commanded bylimb-amputating psychopaths , but by revolutionaries with legitimate grievancesand political goals.For my part , I had been moved and frustrated by the violence against civiliansin <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> earlier in the year . 
I wondered where this cruelty had come from , what purpose its perpetrators imagined . 
More than 10,000 people had beenmurdered , raped , abducted or maimed by rebels in a campaign of calculatedterror . 
In their vividness and gratuitous cruelty , the mass amputationsepitomized the powerlessness of ordinary Africans at the turn of the millennium.They also marked a climactic spasm in a grinding eight-year civil war shaped byfamiliar patterns . 
Outsiders exploited <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> 's diamonds and otherresources . 
Neighboring nations sought advantage by interfering with internalconflicts . 
Post-colonial politics lay in ruins , felled by autocracy andcorruption . 
The international media paid little attention . 
And the great powersstood aside , numbed by <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> 's wars and poverty . 
Finding money to haltaggression against civilians , build democratic society or even vaccinatechildren in a country like <PERSON>Sierra Leone</PERSON> had become a demoralizing , often futileendeavor in official <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . 
Many Africans added all this up and sawsystematic racism -- a place in global affairs that reflected continuousdiscrimination and exploitation since the days of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> slave trade.That the unchecked amputations in <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> coincided with <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> 's forcefulintervention in <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION> only drew these frustrations to a sharper point . 
Ofcourse , the two conflicts took place in vastly different arenas . 
NATO ' sintervention in <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION> occurred in a place where the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and Europeanpowers had deep strategic and military interests . 
They had no such interests inSierra <PERSON>Leone</PERSON> , other perhaps than the advancement of their values . 
But there wasmore involved in the comparison than the interests of governments and militaryplanners.In <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION> , the middle-class status and racial features of the victims , as wellas echoes of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> 's Holocaust , allowed many Americans to empathize with theKosovars , to feel and imagine what happens when armies loose themselves oncivilians . 
The resulting popular outrage in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> helpedensure the reversal of the expulsion of civilians by <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> 's government andbolstered plans to indict President <PERSON>Slobodan Milosevic</PERSON> and other responsibleSerbs on war crimes charges . 
But in <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> , outside engagement with thewar came to be dominated by pity-inducing , context-empty images of the limbless , whether in media coverage or during visits by politicians to <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> ' srehabilitation camps for amputees . 
These stripped-down , politics-free picturesof armless victims helped to consign <PERSON>Sierra Leone</PERSON> 's war to the mental box manyAmericans reserve for <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> . 
Few understood , for example , that most ofFreetown 's victims were as urban and middle class as <LOCATION>Pristina</LOCATION> 's . 
The greatest contrast lay in the outcomes . 
The violent campaign againstcivilians carried out by rebel forces in <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> last <DATE>January</DATE> not only failedto stir American and European governments , it set the stage for a UnitedNations-endorsed rebel triumph . 
Early last <DATE>summer</DATE> , as <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> declared victory inKosovo , West African nations , the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>United Nationsprovided</ORGANIZATION> diplomatic and financial backing for a peace agreement that deliveredamnesty to the rebels . 
The agreement -- called the Lome accord , after thecapital of <LOCATION>Togo</LOCATION> , where it was signed <DATE>July 7</DATE> -- also gave the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> several cabinetseats in a transition government , granted the rebels effective control over thenation 's diamond mines , and invited them to join national elections next year tobe supported by <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers . 
In other words , notwithstanding what happenedin <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> last <DATE>January</DATE> -- or , rather , because of what happened -- the rebelsachieved something like victory.As we rattled among palms and through neck-high grasses along the clay trackinto rebel headquarters at <LOCATION>Buedu</LOCATION> , one question hanging over <PERSON>Sierra Leone</PERSON> waswhether the <ORGANIZATION>Revolutionary United Front</ORGANIZATION> really wanted the peace it had won . 
Ashaky cease-fire had prevailed since <DATE>July</DATE> between government and rebel forces , but clashes among rebel factions erup-ted regularly . 
The Lome agreement requiresall combatants to disarm under <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> supervision and enter into rehabilitationcamps for schooling and job training . 
But the camps , especially in the forestareas controlled by General Mosquito , have mostly stood empty.Mosquito has been the focus of <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> 's anxiety about whether peace willhold . 
Leading a force of more than 10,000 armed men , he was perhaps the mostfeared man in <LOCATION>Sierra Leone</LOCATION> . 
As the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> 's chief of defense staff , he was therebels ' most prominent battlefield commander in recent years , the man in chargeon the ground while the movement 's supreme political leader , a former armyphotographer named <PERSON>Foday Sankoh</PERSON> , languished in jail or in exile . 
Rarelyphotographed or seen in public , Mosquito moved like a shape-shifting spectraldemon around the country 's rain forests , surfacing via satellite telephone toissue blood-curdling threats through <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> media or the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> World Service.Rumor and debate raged about his motivations and ambitions . 
What kind of countrydid he want ? 
What role did he imagine for himself ? 
Could he accept peace , or washe now so accustomed to jungle warfare -- so unable to imagine an alternativefor himself -- that violent " revolution , " whatever that meant , had effectivelybecome his lifetime profession?In the answers to those questions lies the credibility of the internationalcommunity that bargained with Mosquito . 
In them too lies the future of SierraLeone , and part of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> 's future as well.III.Buedu : In Mosquito Country " I am a good-looking man , a big showman , I like good living , " Mosquito declared , tilting to aim a menacing stare at the Egyptian colonel sitting beside him . 
" Canyou en-camp me !!? 
" No , the Egyptian allowed , it seemed unlikely that Mosquito would enroll in aU.N . 
rehabilitation camp . 
The colonel sat nervously with three other U.N.military observers in a circle of plastic chairs assembled in fading light on adirt lawn near the Buedu bungalow housing Mosquito 's offices . 
The <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> team hadturned up in confused circumstances late that afternoon at the town 's westernentrance . 
They seemed to think they had been arrested.Mosquito sat center stage at this ambiguous tribunal , resplendent inquasi-military dress : a felt beret with two pinned stars , combat camouflage , asilver pistol and , around his neck , a medallion in the shape of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> hooked toa shiny gold chain.For the past half-hour , he had declaimed about the failings of the UnitedNations in <LOCATION>Sierra Leone</LOCATION> and around the world . 
He complained bitterly that U.N.observers such as these four had been traversing RUF-controlled territorywithout his knowledge . 
He dramatically threatened to withdraw securityguarantees for <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> personnel . 
He mentioned the commander of <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> 's U.N.military observer force by name and threatened him with death.And then , after declaring , " We are ready to disarm , but it should be done in away that guarantees our security and provides something of what we fought for , " Mosquito told the officers they could go . 
They saluted and extended backpedalinghandshakes , jumped in their jeeps and sped west toward government-heldterritory . 
Mosquito had arranged this spectacle as much for our benefit as for the UnitedNations ' , it seemed . 
We had been in <LOCATION>Buedu</LOCATION> since early the previous morning , andincreasingly the place seemed a phantasmagoric theater.Our host was ebullient . 
He talked for hours about the war , the prospects forpeace , and his own life story , which involved his rise from professionalnightclub dancer and women 's hairdresser to national revolutionary commander . 
Hebuzzed flamboyantly around town on an off-road motorcycle . 
He changed clothesfrequently -- safari suits , European designer wraparound sunglasses , the latestdesigner jeans and , for a family photo on our final morning , a smart charcoaldouble-breasted suit.He would pull up to us on his dirt bike , lean back on the seat , and makepronouncements in lilting English such as , " I am a military man and I do n'tthink I can transform myself into a civilian . 
I will die as a soldier . " 
Pause . 
" Or I will retire as a soldier . " 
Vroooooom . . . " You know , " he observed delightedly during one long account of the war , " Ireally admire myself . 
" Mosquito is a Big Man in a very small town . 
He delivered thumping speeches tohis men about his decision to live in the rain forest rather than in Freetown.He forswore political ambition . 
" I do n't want to be minister . 
I do n't want to bepresident , " he told them . 
" All I want is to see this revolution through . 
But wewill not disarm until total revolution is achieved in <LOCATION>Sierra Leone</LOCATION> . 
" Total revolution ? 
And that would look like?The arid phrases of <PERSON>Moammar Gadhafi</PERSON> 's Green Book , the Libyan leader 's manifestofor " people 's revolution , " blew through <PERSON>Buedu</PERSON> like a bad wind . 
Free schooling , free medical care , an end to corruption , nepotism and tribalism -- these havebeen the slogans of <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> pamphlets and radio broadcasts for years . 
The rebels ' themes successfully tap popular disgust over <PERSON>Sierra Leone</PERSON> 's failed one-partypolitics after independence . 
They speak to a generation of rural young people -- including Mosquito himself -- who never made it to <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> , whose familieslacked the pluck or position to stake a claim in <LOCATION>Kissy</LOCATION> 's suburban hills , and whofound themselves shut out by <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> 's failed education system and corruptpublic sector.Yet as a practical matter , you could locate more socialist engineering inMontgomery County than in eastern <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> . 
War-ravaged RUF-controlledterritory is so poor that it is all most people can do to feed themselves fromsmall rice plots and fruit trees . 
The <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> appoints commanders to run towns andcities , honors traditional chiefs where they have survived , and lately has triedto work with foreign charities and citizen committees to develop socialservices . 
But the forests remain a desperate subsistence economy.Confident theories of national revolution rang out noisily in Buedu nonetheless.Most startling was the ideological fountainhead of one <PERSON>Martin Coker</PERSON> , " personalassistant to General Mosquito , " who told us he had lived in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> , area for much of the <DATE>1990s</DATE> . 
We first heard the improbable , clipped tones of <ORGANIZATION>Coker</ORGANIZATION> 's middle-class Britishaccent as we unpacked ourselves from our jeep upon arrival in <LOCATION>Buedu</LOCATION> . 
" Goodmorning ! " 
declared a tall , polite man holding an official-looking bundle ofpapers . 
" Welcome to the defense headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION>Revolutionary United Front !</ORGANIZATION> 
" Born to an elite <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> family , <PERSON>Coker</PERSON> attended school in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and thenmigrated to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , where he developed a business putting up ceilings in majorD.C . 
area office buildings -- including , he said , <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION>Langley</LOCATION> . 
Aneo-Marxist as well as an entrepreneur , he listened regularly to WPFW 's PacificaRadio talk shows and fed his revolutionary yearnings at leftist bookstores inDupont Circle . 
In <DATE>1997</DATE> , some sort of spiritual crisis -- he said it involvedportentous dreams , his faith in God , and a belief in the urgency of a people ' srevolution in <LOCATION>Sierra Leone</LOCATION> -- caused him to return to <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> . 
There he presentedhimself unannounced as an intellectual who wished to serve the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> . 
He wound upat Mosquito 's base camp.Coker ran the general 's satellite telephone , television and radio systems ; helped to write Mosquito 's letters to <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> colleagues , the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> andforeign heads of state ; maintained a computer room ; and helped to supervise " Radio Freedom , voice of the <ORGANIZATION>People 's Army of Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> , " an FM station inBuedu that <PERSON>Coker</PERSON> said was paid for with a particularly fine diamond , and whichwas now broadcasting rap music and <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> messages across the country 's easternforests.Delighted to have his hometown newspaper visiting Buedu , <PERSON>Coker</PERSON> asked about theWizards ' prospects ( poor , we admitted ) and became our effusive guide to theRUF 's nascent revolutionary society . 
Intelligent , articulate and plagued byrecurring malarial fever , he seemed a tropical , slightly unhinged version of oneof those political commissars the Soviets used to place on their nuclear-armedsubmarines -- feared and influential , but vulnerable to fragging.Arrayed along a dirt track and made up of perhaps 100 homes , Buedu teemed withyoung men carrying assault rifles . 
Some of them were " recruits " captured inbattle , taken from their families and indoctrinated in <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> ideology . 
Theseincluded boys no older than 14 who belonged to the feared " Small Boys Unit , " orSBU , notorious in <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> for carrying out grotesque acts of violence . 
InBuedu , the boys typically worked as household help for senior commanders . 
Cokerarranged for us to interview several , even as he railed against the West ' scriticism of " child soldiers . " 
Elitist human rights activists fail tounderstand , he explained , that in a people 's army , families must move together " on the front lines " -- husband , wife , children all fighting the people 's wartogether.As <PERSON>Coker</PERSON> listened , the boys told us how pleased they were to be <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> volunteers -- they could hardly have said otherwise in the circumstances . 
But in recitinghow they were captured in battle and separated from their families , nostalgicemotion sometimes reached their throats . 
" I have a family I 've left behind , but I 'll stay with this family until it ' stime to look and decide , " said <PERSON>Corporal Jonathan Phillie</PERSON> , contemplating hisfuture if peace holds . 
He was only in sixth grade when he was captured by theRUF three years ago ; he does sometimes think about a world beyond Buedu . 
" I wantto be a doctor , " he said . 
" It 's a blessed job . 
" IV.Buedu : At the CrossroadsOn our final night at <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> headquarters , we sat with Mosquito in a dark concreteroom and talked for hours about his past and future , tracing a journey thatholds many threads of <LOCATION>West Africa</LOCATION> 's crisis.He never knew his father , quit school at 19 and struggled as a diamond miner , sometimes supporting himself as a nightclub dancer . 
" I was fed up with SierraLeone . " 
He migrated to <LOCATION>Monrovia</LOCATION> , the capital of <LOCATION>Liberia</LOCATION> , where " a lady convincedme to try to learn to be a beautician . 
I was not easily convinced to do the workat first because I thought it was women 's work . 
I was feeling impoverished , andshe led me to a salon , and it impressed me . 
A whole apartment with a hall andpassages . . . all wall-to-wall carpet . 
I saw a young man standing over somehigh-ranking women and I said , ' No problem , a good-looking man like myself , <ORGANIZATION>Ican</ORGANIZATION> do it . ' 
" Mosquito paused . 
" Even now , I can do any hairstyle . 
" Like many among his generation , he thought of aiming for <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
Hetook courses that would qualify him as an electrician . 
He had an ambitious plan : to move to <LOCATION>Abidjan</LOCATION> , the relatively prosperous West African capital of the IvoryCoast , do electrical work and become a beautician in a parlor frequented " byhigh government women . " 
He would then seduce and cajole his way to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> . 
" Thatwas my big plan -- to jump to <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and become the person about whom people say , ' He 's the top man . ' 
" Then civil war erupted in <LOCATION>Liberia</LOCATION> . 
" I think if the war had n't happened , I wouldhave been somebody in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> by now , " he reflected . 
" I would have changed myposition [ by now ] to <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> or maybe the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> . " 
Instead , he startedhanging out with Liberians who were gathering arms and volunteering for combat.He heard about a plan to recruit Sierra Leoneans to start their ownrevolutionary force . 
He traveled abroad to what he would only call " anundisclosed location " ( almost certainly <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> ) for extensive classroom andcombat training . 
At revolution school he met Sierra Leonean politicaldissidents , including <PERSON>Foday Sankoh</PERSON> . 
Together they formed the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1991</DATE> . 
" I wasnot recruited . 
I recruited myself . " 
He began to read the <ORGANIZATION>Green Book</ORGANIZATION> and , " Ibecame interested in this , that these are some of the things that man can do . 
" I asked about his battlefield leadership of the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> 's war and the terribleviolence inflicted on civilians . 
He had been waiting for questions about humanrights . 
As he prepared to answer , he pulled his pistol out of his jeans pocketand set it on his thigh . 
It seemed an instinctive gesture . 
" I do n't believe in innocent killing in the field , " he replied emphatically.Through his satellite and Internet connections to global news , it became clear , Mosquito had studied in some depth his potential problems under war crimes law.He criticized <PERSON>Mary Robinson</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> high commissioner for human rights , because she had suggested that <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> commanders might eventually be subject toprosecution , despite the Lome accord 's amnesty . 
He insisted that he , personally , had only executed men under justifiable circumstances -- to enforce martial lawor prevent desertions . 
" I have no outlaw record , " he said . 
" If soldiers haveraped , I have executed them . 
If soldiers have dropped arms , I have disciplinedthem . 
Those are the only two crimes I have committed . 
" What about the dozens of boys and young women in his own camp who had beenabducted and recruited by the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> ? 
" We do n't force people to join , " he answered . 
" When we capture these girls , we encourage the young people to join , " and theydo , voluntarily.He claimed that he had never ordered amputations of civilians . 
He saidex-soldiers allied with the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> , but not directly under its command , wereresponsible for the worst atrocities in <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> in <DATE>January</DATE> . 
( Human rightsinvestigators say those ex-soldiers probably did carry out a large proportion ofthe violence , but that <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> combatants also carried out amputations , killings andabductions . ) 
Mosquito accused government militias of carrying out amputationsand then blaming them on the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> . 
( We met amputees in <LOCATION>Buedu</LOCATION> who told crediblestories of being tortured by the government militias . 
New York-based HumanRights Watch accuses the militias of human rights violations , but says abuses bythe <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> and its allied ex-soldiers have taken place on a far greater scale . ) 
Once the amputations began , <PERSON>Mosquito</PERSON> said , each side retaliated against theother . 
" It started as a revenge . 
If some have done it to your relatives , youwill go back and do this . 
To boys who had their hands cut . . . when you seethis with your own eyes , you want to take revenge on their families . 
" Mosquito tells his men he is protected from bullets by magic powers . 
As wetalked late into the <TIME>night</TIME> , he stood and stripped off his shirt to show scarsacross his shoulders and arms -- from bullets that have bounced off him , hesaid . 
He pulled down his jeans to show similar wounds on his thighs.Yet the longer he talked , the more it became clear that , superpowers or no , Mosquito at 35 lacked a convincing vision of his own future . 
Last <DATE>spring</DATE> , hesaid , Lebanese intermediaries working for the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government offered him <MONEY>$ 2.5 million</MONEY> to leave <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> and settle peacefully in <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION> . 
He said he askedthe negotiators to bring the cash to the Liberia-Sierra Leone border . 
" I wasgoing to ambush them , deal with them ruthlessly and spend the money on arms , " hesaid . 
They refused to come . 
Afterward , he told that story repeatedly to hisfollowers and vowed never to be bought off . 
Still , as the night wore on , hetalked wistfully of <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , even though he knew he would be vulnerableto arrest in such places . 
Other times he talked of his desire to lead SierraLeone 's army after the next election . 
And then , over and over , he waved his armsand threatened angrily to retreat from <LOCATION>Buedu</LOCATION> to the rain forest and start thewar all over again . 
If he were provoked by the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> or <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> ' sgovernment , he said , " I 'm envisaging another serious battle in <LOCATION>Sierra Leone</LOCATION> . 
Itold all my men to clean all their barrels and wait . 
" V.Buedu to <LOCATION>Koidu</LOCATION> : The Best IntentionsFreed blacks and white Christian abolitionists in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> createdSierra <PERSON>Leone</PERSON> as a new , enlightened " Province of Freedom " in <DATE>1792</DATE> . 
Since then , the export of American and European values to this stretch of the <LOCATION>West Africancoast</LOCATION> has been a sorry , violent , hypocritical business.Like <LOCATION>Liberia</LOCATION> next door , <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> owes its existence as a modern nation-stateto international humanitarian law , at least as it was understood by British andAmerican reformers in the late-18th and early-19th centuries . 
Abhorring slaverybut unable to imagine a multiracial society at home , British idealists conceivedof <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> as a homeland for free but impoverished black populationslanguishing in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> . 
The former included <PERSON>Jamaican Maroons</PERSON> , who hadwon their freedom in revolt , and American blacks who had been freed from slaveryto fight with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> during the American Revolutionary War but were thenshipped off to freezing <LOCATION>Nova Scotia</LOCATION> when the redcoats lost . 
Later , Britishopponents of the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> slave trade began seizing slave vessels on the highseas and freeing their human cargo in <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> 's harbor . 
Few of these freedslaves could figure out how to get home again , so <PERSON>Sierra Leone</PERSON> became a meltingpot of African cultures and tongues from as far south as Angola.Even as we plunged into the interior , my Jamaican-born colleague , <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> , couldunderstand much of the local creole , which contains phrases and inversionsclosely related to Jamaican dialect . 
It felt odd , amid such dense forest , tohear the linguistic residue of such a long , tangled history of Westernexploitation and reform -- although no more odd than it was to encounterMosquito 's satellite-downloaded globalism . 
" Open the arsenal ! " 
our host declared dramatically on our final afternoon inBuedu , as his men loaded supplies into a " Mad Max " special , a dented Toyotapickup equipped with several boxes of rocket-propelled grenade shells , half adozen grenade launchers , an equal number of cans of sardines ( for sustenance , not defense ) , a dozen cans of beer and soda , and a last-minute gift fromMosquito himself , a three-quarters-full bottle of Irish cream liqueur . 
Thepickup would also carry us , an <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> colonel , two other commanders , one of ourLiberian police escorts and , in the truck bed , all of our luggage plus eightbodyguards armed with assault rifles . 
I liked our chances in an ambush , butwondered if the potential for spontaneous combustion had been underestimated.Our plan was to travel the length of RUF-controlled <PERSON>Sierra Leone</PERSON> , from the farnortheastern corner of the country , through diamond territory and finally to theprovincial town of <LOCATION>Makeni</LOCATION> , about 100 miles from <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> . 
We set out late in theafternoon . 
Our driver popped in a cassette and <PERSON>Kirk Franklin</PERSON> 's " Revolution " rocked from the speakers as we raced down a grassy track . 
Half-empty smokyvillages appeared every few miles , ragged and visibly impoverished , a sharp fallfrom the more prosperous impression of <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> headquarters.These eastern forests have borne the brunt of <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> 's tragedy for nearlya decade . 
When <PERSON>Gadhafi</PERSON> and Liberian warlord <PERSON>Charles Taylor</PERSON> launched the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> inthe autumn of <DATE>1991</DATE> , hoping to rattle their enemies in <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> 's government , itwas here that the original band of 100 cadres , including Mosquito , firstattacked government outposts and enrolled recruits . 
There has been little letupsince.The <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> 's most significant early achievement was to stimulate a coup inFreetown . 
A 28-year-old army captain , <PERSON>Valentine Strasser</PERSON> , who had grown tired ofbattling the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> without a regular paycheck , marched to the capital with some ofhis men and demanded their salaries . 
Sierra <PERSON>Leone</PERSON> 's president -- heir to anundistinguished line of undemocratic politicians -- panicked and fled . 
Strasserdecided that , well , since the office was vacant , he would appoint himselfpresident . 
It was a measure of popular desperation that this Lord of the Fliesgovernment of twentysomething junior officers initially received a warm welcome.Four years later in <DATE>1996</DATE> , <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> persuaded the junta toleave by offering the novel inducement of scholarships and stipends to studyabroad at the universities of their choice.The grim statistics of <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> 's sliding life expectancies and ballooningrates of child mortality are compiled in eastern towns like <LOCATION>Pendembu</LOCATION> , where weslept our first night out of Buedu . 
There is little food distribution or medicalservice of any kind behind <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> lines . 
The government cites security concerns andsays the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> wo n't cooperate . 
The <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> says the government is starving it ofservices to weaken the rebels ' political base . 
The braver internationalcharities , such as Doctors Without Borders , make occasional forays into theeastern forests . 
( Mosquito kidnapped two Doctors Without Borders volunteers lastmonth , releasing them unharmed days later . ) 
But refugees lured home by reportsof peace find essentially a wasteland . 
Only the bounty of the rain forest -- particularly its fruit trees -- prevents a famine . 
" We are all tired of the war now , " our host in <LOCATION>Pendembu</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>RUF Colonel VindeyCosi</ORGANIZATION> , told us . 
" Whenever the leader says we should disarm , we will disarm . 
Butwe are waiting for an order . 
" We saw the problem the next morning in <LOCATION>Daru</LOCATION> : empty tents flapping in the wind inan open field between an <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> checkpoint and a government barracks , manned byNigerian soldiers who serve in effect as <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> 's army . 
The tents had beenerected to receive disarming <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> combatants under the Lome accord and torehabilitate them for new lives in peacetime . 
But under Mosquito 's orders , nocombatants had yet arrived.We had to cross government lines at <LOCATION>Daru</LOCATION> to traverse the only bridge over thewide <LOCATION>Moa River</LOCATION> that could handle our truck . 
That afternoon , pointed north towardthe diamond mines , we entered dense , empty forest . 
In silence we cut throughswamp , grasses , palms , mango groves and soaring hardwood giants . 
Streamscrisscrossed the track every half mile , and we slid across bridges strapped fromlogs , rocks and the occasional steel beam . 
Flowering plants and fronds obscuredthe sky . 
Spiders and dragonflies as big as fists splashed into the cabin as wecrashed through puddles three feet deep.Apparitions of poverty or war flashed by periodically : a boy no older than 11standing sentry , an AK-47 strapped to his shoulder ; disheveled families innearly empty villages , cooking over smoky fires ; two boys carrying rice bags whofled into the bush when they saw our heavily armed vehicle.We limped at dusk into <LOCATION>Koidu</LOCATION> , rocking on two flat tires and a snapped shockabsorber , headlights gone . 
Once we realized where we had at last arrived , thestreams we forded acquired a new allure . 
In the pinkish half-light , you staredat the stones and sand and wondered what a rough diamond might look like.Koidu and surrounding <LOCATION>Kono District</LOCATION> are the prize that for generations has luredcolonizers , mercenaries , bandits , prospectors and revolutionaries to SierraLeone 's interior . 
After slavery , its outpouring of diamonds has been the sourceof the country 's greatest misery and exploitation . 
Scraped over by thousands ofgreedy hands , the region no longer ranks among the world 's better diamondfields , but it still yields enough to fire imaginations and fuel the schemes ofcrooks , killers and politicians.Around a bend loomed the abandoned , rusting hulk of a mining complex built a fewyears before by a private corporation of South African mercenaries whose 1995intervention in <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> 's war marked a strange nadir . 
Too busy partying inFreetown to contain the bush-disciplined <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Strasser</PERSON> 's twentysomething juntahired Pretoria-based Executive Outcomes , a private company , to fight its war.Strasser paid <MONEY>$ 15 million</MONEY> and a share of <LOCATION>Koidu</LOCATION> 's diamond concessions to thefirm , which was led by retired white officers from the notorious apartheid-era32 Battalion of the South African special forces . 
Executive Outcomes staged alightning triumph , using attack helicopters , artillery and well-paid blackAngolan and Namibian troops to push the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> 's outskirts all theway to small enclaves in the east . 
The mercenaries secured Kono , erected amassive defense perimeter around the diamond areas , laid anti-personnel minesthrough the forest , and settled in to start digging out their reward.The success of Executive Outcomes set in motion the events that led ultimatelyto the horror in <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> last <DATE>January</DATE> . 
The twenty-something junta went back toschool . 
The appearance of stability created by the mercenaries led to peacetalks with the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> and a proposal for free elections . 
But the accord quicklyfell apart . 
The <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> complained that elections were being rushed before it couldorganize as a political party ; the government complained the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> was not seriousabout peace . 
The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> pressed forward with the vote early in <DATE>1996</DATE> , declaring it would not be held back by the rebels.The eventual winner , a former <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> official named <PERSON>Ahmad Tejan Kabbah</PERSON> , campaignedon the slogan " The Future Is in Your Hands . " 
Some Sierra Leoneans believe thiselectoral slogan helped give birth to the country 's cycle of amputations . 
Duringthe campaign , <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> rebels began cutting off civilians ' hands to " send them back " to <PERSON>Kabbah</PERSON> in a grisly reply to his electoral speeches , according to human rightsinvestigators . 
Still , tens of thousands of ordinary Sierra Leoneans risked theirlives to vote . 
Witnesses said that in places such as the southern town of Bo , the vote went forward almost as a popular uprising against the rebels.But soon after <PERSON>Kabbah</PERSON> took office , some former army bodyguards to the <LOCATION>Strasserjunta</LOCATION> seized power -- angry because they had not also been offered scholarshipsabroad . 
Calling themselves the <ORGANIZATION>Armed Forces Revolutionary Council</ORGANIZATION> , they invitedthe <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> to join their new government . 
<ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> rebels entered <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> openly for thefirst time , squatting in federal ministries and looting vigorously in a programdubbed " Operation Pay Yourself . " 
Freetown residents went on strike and refusedto cooperate with the new regime . 
West African governments , the <ORGANIZATION>United Statesand Britain</ORGANIZATION> persuaded <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION> to send troops to restore <PERSON>Kabbah</PERSON> . 
Embarrassed bythe presence of South African mercenaries , <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> also insisted that Kabbahbreak the contract with Executive Outcomes . 
Gradually , the Nigerians pushed therebels out of <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> . 
Kabbah returned to the shattered capital and the RUFappeared again to be routed . 
<PERSON>Sankoh</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> 's supreme leader , was arrested , tried and sentenced to death.But in the eastern forests , Mosquito rallied his retreating men , reorganized andplotted revenge . 
He launched as soon as the rains ended in the <DATE>autumn of 1998</DATE> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> and their allies among the bodyguard junta slammed into Kono , thenMakeni , then on toward <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> . 
Ambassador <PERSON>Joseph Melrose</PERSON> evacuated the U.S.Embassy on Christmas Eve . 
Overconfident , underequipped Nigerian commandersallowed the rebels to enter the capital shortly after New Year 's Day . 
The rebelsorganized forced marches of great crowds of abducted civilians to shield theiradvance.By the end of <DATE>January</DATE> , the Nigerians had recovered just enough to begin slowlyrousting the rebels from the capital and its eastern suburbs . 
But by then , thousands upon thousands of people had been killed , kidnapped or mutilated bythe rebels.VI.Freetown : ' We 've come to see you on a very important matter ' He felt sharp pain when the axe first fell . 
The second , third and fourth times , <PERSON>Amadu</PERSON> felt nothing . 
When <PERSON>Tommy</PERSON> had finished , the rebels picked Amadu up andkicked him away from the chopping block at the school gate . 
He did not stay towatch his brothers , Alpha and <PERSON>Dawda</PERSON> , who were behind him in line . 
Bleedingprofusely , he walked and fell , walked and fell , then collapsed on the clay road.Alpha stumbled upon him . 
He , too , was now bleeding from a stump . 
They walkedabout a mile toward <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> . 
The streets were deserted . 
They knocked on astranger 's door along a main road . 
A family bundled them inside . 
Alpha and <PERSON>Amadueach</PERSON> asked for a poisonous potion of cleaning fluid ; they had decided whilewalking that they wanted to commit suicide . 
Their hosts refused . 
They wrappedthe brothers ' wounds , gave them milk and tried to assure them that they wouldsurvive . 
The boys slept fitfully in the parlor . 
Nigerian artillery shells echoedoutside . 
When the sun rose , the boys found themselves on a street newlycontrolled by pro-government forces . 
One of the family with whom they had stayedtook them to the hospital . 
The boys were bedded in a ward where dozens ofamputees were beginning to arrive.The next day , their half-brother tracked them down . 
He told them that their10-year-old brother , <LOCATION>Dawda</LOCATION> , had bled to death in the street after his amputationand had been buried in a makeshift grave nearby . 
Their parents and youngersister had been locked inside their home , which the rebels had set on fire.There was nothing left of them or the house , only charred concrete and rubble.Outside the hospital where the brothers lay , scores of bloodied stragglers anddesperate relatives wandered in the streets , searching for medical help orseeking news of the abducted . 
On street after street in the eastern suburbs , therebels had staged elaborately orchestrated attacks . 
Families were corralled anddivided , some selected for death , some for amputation , some set free . 
Childrenwere raped within earshot or view of their parents . 
The disoriented survivorszigzagged toward <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> 's center , hoping for medical attention or refuge.At the mosque in a section of Kissy 's slopes called Rogbalan , about 100 Muslimsand Christians had huddled for days in the sanctuary . 
Some were neighbors . 
Somewere strangers seeking shelter , people whose names could not later be recalled , whose fate would be registered officially on the lists of the disappeared.After days of harassment and threats , several rebels , including one described bysurvivors as no older than 10 , arrived at the mosque 's gate . 
They wore blackT-shirts and women 's wigs . 
A teenaged boy sitting on the mosque 's steps wascaught warning those in the sanctuary that the rebels were coming . 
The rebelstold the teenager to open his mouth . 
One then jammed an assault rifle down histhroat and shot him dead.They entered the sanctuary and one rebel in a dreadlock wig stood before AlieuBangura , the mosque 's gray-flecked imam . 
" We 've come to see you on a very important matter , " the rebel announced . 
" We ' regoing to kill all of you . " 
" If God Almighty agrees , that will happen , " <PERSON>Bangura</PERSON> replied.They told him to take a few steps back and then they opened fire , tilting theirbarrels down to the floor where dozens lay huddled , spraying wildly from left toright as the refugees screamed . 
Some ran and were gunned down in the courtyardor in the hallway leading to a small school out back.They missed the imam , though he stood right before them -- a miracle , it wouldbe widely agreed . 
As the shooting erupted , a man lying nearby , struggling withpain , kicked <PERSON>Bangura</PERSON> 's legs and knocked him on his back . 
He felt other people ' sblood washing over him , even into his eyes.The stories of other massacres would later echo with common themes : the strange , almost formal deliberateness ; the chilling dialogue between killers and victims , talk that often touched on politics , although the civilian victims usually knewlittle ; and the terrible images of the rebels with their faces covered with drugpatches or masks or bandannas or wigs.All through late <DATE>January</DATE> , corpses lay unattended in the streets . 
At the <ORGANIZATION>KissyMental Hospital</ORGANIZATION> farther up the hill , <ORGANIZATION>Human Rights Watch</ORGANIZATION> would later report , about 16 men were executed and six women hacked with machetes . 
At theBrotherhood of the <ORGANIZATION>Cross</ORGANIZATION> and Star Church in nearby <LOCATION>Wellington</LOCATION> , another 12 , including three children , were massacred with pistols and assault rifles . 
In theeastern suburbs , families were locked in their houses and burned alive . 
Entirestreets were sprayed with kerosene and set alight.Human Rights Watch , citing the government 's senior medical examiner , laterreported that 7,335 corpses were registered for burial after the <DATE>January</DATE> rebeloffensive . 
Thousands more people simply disappeared -- dead or kidnapped , theirfamilies did not know.Helen 's family was among them : They had no idea what had become of her after shewas led away into <ORGANIZATION>Kissy</ORGANIZATION> 's hills by the rebels.As Kissy burned , <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> lay imprisoned at a rebel camp not far away . 
For what shewould later recall as a period of about two weeks , she was gang-raped by boysand men roving in and out of the base . 
Like many other women abducted by therebels , she worked to partially protect herself by forging a union with ColonelBloodshed , relying on him to keep others away . 
By <DATE>February</DATE> , shelled by Nigerianand Guinean troops , they struck camp and trekked to the bush . 
They arrived at anisolated patch of jungle called the <ORGANIZATION>Occra Hills</ORGANIZATION> and settled in . 
Helen wasforbidden to speak freely with other rebel captives . 
In the deepest trough ofnight , she remembers , " when they were asleep , I would raise up my head to see ifeveryone was sleeping . 
But there was no way to escape . 
" <DATE>February</DATE> passed this way . 
And <DATE>March , April</DATE> . 
The <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> resounded with news of amajor war in the <LOCATION>Balkans</LOCATION> . 
In <PERSON>Sierra Leone</PERSON> , the war ebbed ; negotiations for peacehad begun in neighboring countries , sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> . 
The rebelsawaited the results . 
" One night , " <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> recalls , " they were drunk after smoking and drinking . 
Alldrunk , and dancing . 
And they all passed out . . . I was watching them , thinking . 
" She sat down beside another abductee , her friend Fatmatah . 
" Right now , thesepeople are drunk . 
Let 's run away , " <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> recalls saying . 
" They 'll kill us , " Fatmatah whispered . 
" They will not know . 
They 're drunk . 
" They watched some more . 
Fatmatah summoned her courage . 
" Let 's not take a thing , " <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> said . 
" Let 's run . 
" <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> slipped into the forest and soon Fatmatah followed . 
They began to run . 
Forhours they crashed through the blackness , slicing themselves on vines andbrambles . 
They reached a stream and rested until dawn . 
In the light theystumbled down from the hills , found a village and were sheltered by an oldwoman . 
After two days , <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> pressed on for <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> alone . 
She walked until shefound the main road , waved down a van , spilled out her tale and begged thedriver for a ride.In <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> hours later she spotted an uncle in the street , leaped out , andasked about her family . 
Her father , the government official , was in <ORGANIZATION>ConnaughtHospital</ORGANIZATION> . 
The rebels had burned her home . 
Everything was lost . 
But her parentshad survived.At Connaught , she ran to <LOCATION>Ward 8</LOCATION> , where her uncle said her father was recovering.She spotted him sitting in the sun behind a railing on a second-story balcony . 
" Papa ! 
Papa ! 
I 've come ! 
I 've come ! " 
she shouted.Astonished , he called to his wife and raced to meet his daughter . 
Weeping andshouting , they embraced in the hospital hallway , and <PERSON>Helen</PERSON> saw the bandagedstumps above her father 's elbows where his two arms had been.VII.Magburaka : Toward PoliticsSecret societies in painted faces , the graying pooh-bahs of a paramountchieftaincy , the women 's league , children , traders and notables of every stripe -- out they poured by the thousands into dusty streets under a brutal sun , swaying and singing and shouting joyously that the Big Man had come to town . 
" Peace ! " 
he promised when he climbed from a shiny car . 
" Revolution ! " 
they cried , knowing the drill.It was the nearest thing to normalcy we had seen in our travels through ruralSierra Leone -- a holiday festival masquerading as a political rally inMagburaka . 
To the pent-up , school-less , war-weary citizenry of <ORGANIZATION>Makeni District</ORGANIZATION> , just a few hours drive from <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> , it hardly mattered who was the guest ofhonor . 
The party was the thing , and just about any Big Man would do . 
But as ithappened , our slog across <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> territory had led us finally to the rebels ' bossof bosses , " The Leader , " as even General Mosquito called him , former televisioncameraman Foday Sankoh.Shaking his ample belly as he danced and weaved through the throng , Sankohseemed a fuzzy and wizardly man , mild and eccentric . 
" No more war , " he told theyoung <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> combatants who had lined up to greet him in an honor guard , symbolically taking assault rifles out of the boys ' hands . 
" No more war . 
" When <PERSON>Gadhafi</PERSON> organized the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Sankoh</PERSON> was apparently the most credibledissident he could attract to his desert guerrilla school . 
He must have seemedan unlikely cult revolutionary . 
A poorly educated farmer 's son , <PERSON>Sankoh</PERSON> hadenlisted in the army in <DATE>1956</DATE> and never rose above the rank of corporal . 
Hissuperiors sent him to <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> for training as a cameraman , then assigned him toSierra Leonean national television . 
One day in <DATE>1969</DATE> he went to cover a mutiny inan army barracks . 
Instead of reporting on the uprising , he decided to join ; hewas jailed for five years when the coup failed . 
Freetown 's hulking concreteprison became " my first university in politics , " <PERSON>Sankoh</PERSON> said , where he " readabout all revolution -- in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , elsewhere . " 
Upon release , hetraveled east to the rain forest and " used my camera , my photography , as a frontto organize . 
" He fought in the bush during the early years of the war , but after 1996languished in custody or exile until the Lome accord was signed last July.Sankoh ceded the battlefield to Mosquito . 
Tensions between the two men ran high.In Buedu , Mosquito complained to us bitterly that <PERSON>Sankoh</PERSON> was rushing too quicklyto embrace peace , that he was selling out the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> combatants to an uncertainfuture . 
The two men had spent very little time in each other 's company duringthe last several years and each clearly worried that the other might attempt anarrest or assassination . 
" He is my son , " <PERSON>Sankoh</PERSON> said of Mosquito . 
" Why should Mosquito have in mind anyplan to overthrow the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> ? 
He would destroy himself . 
" The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> have invested considerable hope inSankoh . 
They rely on his assertion that he wants to enter politics and run forSierra <PERSON>Leone</PERSON> 's presidency . 
The <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration 's special envoy to <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> , helped persuade <PERSON>Sankoh</PERSON> to embrace the <ORGANIZATION>Lome</ORGANIZATION> deal . 
When thenegotiations reached a critical stage , President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> called him -- Sankohhas been dining out on the conversation ever since . 
" What rebel leader getscalled by the president of the United States ? " 
he asked . 
" I only got that callbecause I fought in the bush for so many years . 
" Not to mention the amputations and kidnappings . 
Here , too , <PERSON>Sankoh</PERSON> went furtherthan Mosquito . 
He sometimes apologized in public for wartime atrocities andbegged public forgiveness for excesses committed by the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> . 
While he said hisenemies staged amputations in order to blame the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> , he was also careful toargue that all of the most offensive atrocities occurred only after <DATE>1996</DATE> -- aperiod when he was no longer leading the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> in the field . 
When governmentmilitias began the amputations and blamed the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> , he said , they created a " political-propaganda machine " that turned opinion against the rebels . 
" But the people know the truth of what happened . 
" That may be so . 
The question is whether it will matter.VIII.Washington : The Meanings of Sierra LeoneWas there really anything the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> or its European allies could havedone to ameliorate <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> 's violence ? 
Perhaps -- and it would not haveinvolved a wrenching decision to put <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> soldiers at risk . 
But it wouldhave required a view of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> far different from the one that has shaped U.S.foreign policy during most of the last decade.As <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> troops withdrew from <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> six years ago after sustaining casualtieson a humanitarian mission , American journalist <PERSON>Robert Kaplan</PERSON> wrote in theAtlantic Monthly an influential essay partially set in <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> titled " TheComing Anarchy . " 
He described the country as engulfed by " an increasinglawlessness that is far more significant than any coup , rebel incursion , orepisodic experiment in democracy , " a lawlessness that signaled a world where " criminal anarchy emerges as the real ' strategic ' danger , " where <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and muchof the rest of the <ORGANIZATION>Third World</ORGANIZATION> would be marked by " the withering away of centralgovernments , the rise of tribal and regional domains , the unchecked spread ofdisease , and the growing pervasiveness of war . 
" <PERSON>Kaplan</PERSON> 's thesis that <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> was drifting beyond governance took hold with manymembers of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> , diplomats and foreign policy analysts . 
It seemed to capturetheir own gathering revulsion and exhaustion with post-Cold War challengesAmerica faced in the <ORGANIZATION>Third World</ORGANIZATION> , especially in violent corners of Africa.Americans and Europeans watched passively during <LOCATION>Rwanda</LOCATION> 's genocide in <DATE>1994</DATE> , where hundreds of thousands of African civilians died in a killing spree fargreater in scale than anything that has taken place in <LOCATION>Sierra Leone</LOCATION> . 
PresidentClinton later expressed pangs of regret . 
Nine months before the crisis inFreetown , he embarked on a six-country tour of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> , and he apologized inRwanda for the West 's failure to intervene . 
But in early <DATE>1999</DATE> , as the rebelsentered <PERSON>Sierra Leone</PERSON> 's capital and began to butcher civilians , the <ORGANIZATION>United Statesshut</ORGANIZATION> its embassy and stood down ; among other things , <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> now had a Senateimpeachment trial on his hands.There was an alternative . 
By <DATE>late 1998</DATE> , <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION> had already placed thousands oftroops in <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> with support from a broad alliance of Africangovernments . 
This alliance would almost certainly have battled the rebelsindefinitely if the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> had provided funding , intelligence , communications and weaponry -- as they have subsequently pledgedto do , on a more limited scale , to support the Lome accord . 
Nigerian and otherAfrican troops fighting from a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> - and European-supplied high-technologyplatform almost certainly could have pushed the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> out of nearly every majorcity and town . 
Not that a military victory would have been certain orinexpensive . 
Nor would it have necessarily curtailed violence against civilians , as the <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION> intervention showed . 
But reducing the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> to a marginal , defeatedforce scattered in the bush probably could have been achieved with anall-African intervention army roughly the size of the one that eventuallyentered Kosovo.Of course , no such scenario was ever seriously entertained . 
State Departmentofficials say it was hardly even discussed at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> . 
Sierra Leone isprobably the last place on <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> in which today 's <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> would wish to fight.Moreover , the handful of specialists paying attention were n't sure the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> couldbe defeated on the battlefield . 
And the humanitarians in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Londonwho</PERSON> complained about <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> 's neglect had little stomach for a militarysolution . 
When <PERSON>Tony Blair</PERSON> 's government was caught early in <DATE>1999</DATE> trying tosmuggle arms to <PERSON>Kabbah</PERSON> to help him fight the rebels , outrage among liberals inBritain forced the government to apologize and back down.So instead , the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> leaned on <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> 's electedpresident to open peace talks with the rebels just weeks after they hadslaughtered thousands in <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> . 
The <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration turned the casefile over to <PERSON>Jesse Jackson</PERSON> , a special envoy with virtually no bureaucraticclout , a negotiator with a one-peace-fits-all approach . 
General Mosquito , commanding 10,000 teenagers in the rain forest , discovered that he could bringthe world 's most powerful military nations to the bargaining table through theselective application of force . 
" When I ran out of alternatives , I had no choicebut to go on the offensive , to use force , which is all they understand , " hesays . 
" I had the upper hand -- I told them that they had to release <PERSON>Sankoh</PERSON> andgo around the table " for settlement talks.And why would the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> go along with his demands ? 
To secure peace , argues <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> , but also because an isolationist <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and an indifferentpublic meant the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> had no alternative but negotiation . 
" If we couldgo in there with half of the <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION> budget and use that budget as an essentialforce to democratize , we 'd have something to offer , " <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> says . 
But countriesonly intervene where public opinion insists or strategic interests are seen tobe at stake . 
" This , of course , is press coverage , " <PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> says . 
" If Americanshad seen Sierra Leoneans walking down the street amputated , babies bludgeonedand pregnant women stabbed , Americans would have been as upset over <PERSON>Sierra Leoneas</PERSON> they were over <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION> . . . Part of this thing is putting light on <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> . 
" Defending the peace negotiations and amnesty plan for the rebels , the architectsof the Lome accord cite <LOCATION>East Africa</LOCATION> 's <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> as inspiration . 
There a similarpeace agreement persuaded <ORGANIZATION>Renamo</ORGANIZATION> -- a guerrilla group that once terrorized andmutilated civilians -- to forswear violence and enter politics . 
Last month , <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> staged its latest successful elections after five years of peace andsurging economic growth . 
Renamo leaders sit in parliament ; they have no warcrimes tribunals to fear.But much has changed in the world since <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> 's peace was forged in <DATE>1994</DATE> . 
War crimes tribunals have convened for <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Rwanda</LOCATION> . 
<LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> 's formermilitary dictator , Gen. <PERSON>Augusto Pinochet</PERSON> , has been arrested on torture chargesin <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> . 
And in <LOCATION>Kosovo</LOCATION> , of course , an entire war was framed in <DATE>1999</DATE> aroundthe ideas of international humanitarian law.Now comes a U.N.-sponsored amnesty absolving the <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> and its allies ofkidnapping , rape , murder and amputation . 
" For civil society in <LOCATION>Sierra Leone</LOCATION> , forcivil society in <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> generally , the amnesty shook the concept ofaccountability to the core , " argues <PERSON>Peter Takirambudde</PERSON> , executive director forAfrica at <ORGANIZATION>Human Rights Watch</ORGANIZATION> . 
" It represented a major retreat by all the parties -- the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> , the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration , the others . 
For the rest of <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> , where there are rebels in the bush , the signal is that atrocities can becommitted -- especially if they are frightening atrocities . 
The lesson to otherrebels is that half measures will not do . 
" That is certainly the lesson Mosquito has learned . 
Last month , four weeks afterwe left his camp , Mosquito reportedly fled Buedu in a spasm of bloodshed . 
TheNigerian general commanding pro-government forces in <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leone</ORGANIZATION> announced thatMosquito had executed eight of his senior aides after accusing them ofconspiring against him , and that he had then left the country . 
In <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Sierra Leoneans</ORGANIZATION> initially celebrated . 
The <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> appointed a new general loyal toSankoh to command guerrillas in the eastern forests . 
On <DATE>December 29</DATE> , <PERSON>Sankoh</PERSON> helda press conference in the capital . 
He announced that Mosquito had been fired forinsubordination , the <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> reported , and he sharply criticized the peace process.Mosquito surfaced in <LOCATION>Monrovia</LOCATION> , where <PERSON>Charles Taylor</PERSON> , now president of <LOCATION>Liberia</LOCATION> , said he hoped to broker a reconciliation between Mosquito and <PERSON>Sankoh</PERSON> . 
How manymen had followed Mosquito ? 
Had <PERSON>Martin Coker</PERSON> stayed with him , or had he beenamong the executed " conspirators " ? 
The <ORGANIZATION>RUF</ORGANIZATION> did not say.There were reports from <LOCATION>Liberia</LOCATION> that Mosquito would be offered -- or forced toaccept -- a life in exile . 
But who would enforce such a deal ? 
Reading theconfused reports of his retreat from <LOCATION>Buedu</LOCATION> , I remembered that at several pointsduring our long talks about his future , Mosquito had hinted that if he wasforced to break openly with <PERSON>Sankoh</PERSON> , he would simply start his own , newrevolutionary movement to carry on the violent struggle . 
Perhaps this was whathe now intended . 
His countrymen will find out soon enough.IX.Freetown : Among the WoundedSome of <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> 's amputees live in a village of blue and white canvas shacks , not far from the center of town . 
The " Medecins Sans Frontieres Amputee and WarWounded Camp , " as it calls itself on a sign scrawled near a busy road , holds 371registered amputees and their families . 
Drainage ditches run among rows oftacked-together homes supplied by a patchwork of foreign charities . 
A primaryschool assembles each morning under an open thatched-roof gazebo . 
Up the slope , men are raising felled tree limbs to construct a new mosque.It is an eerie , nervous time in <LOCATION>Freetown</LOCATION> . 
An uncertain peace has held just longenough that some rebels are beginning to drift out of the bush and back into thecapital , looking for jobs or friends or just a break from sleeping on theground . 
<PERSON>Sierra Leone</PERSON> is small enough and frightened enough that people keeptrack of strangers in their midst , and sometimes a neighborhood can identifyreturning rebels just as soon as they shuffle up the road . 
Then questions ofjustice and equity and international law acquire an immediacy not often felt inThe <LOCATION>Hague</LOCATION> . 
Some of the returnees have been lynched or burned alive . 
More oftenthe streets ring out with shouts or threats or spontaneous debates.The appetite for peace runs so deep and so broad in <LOCATION>Sierra Leone</LOCATION> that itsmothers all else . 
Even some who have been badly abused by the rebels areprepared to accept them into politics if it truly means peace . 
Ask aboutjustice , and you hear about its impossibility -- no one can imagine how youcould give evidence safely . 
The rebels are ministers now , they drive around townin new cars with sirens and armed escorts . 
They can snap their fingers and comeand take you in the <TIME>night</TIME> . 
Who is going to testify against them ? 
Such doubtsflow from an accurate reading by ordinary <PERSON>Sierra Leoneans</PERSON> of their ownpowerlessness.In the voices of the wounded pulses an impressive effort to close off the past.To do so requires a resilience that no outsider can readily imagine . 
Listeningand listening , you begin to feel that the survivors of such an invasion map notonly a random distribution of luck , but also a selection of a certain kind ofemotional muscle.And yet there are those who atrophy , even now , even in the snug village of blueand white canvas shacks , where Alpha and <PERSON>Amadu Jalloh</PERSON> , two brothers with twocomplementary arms , share a room behind a flap and drift off to town most daysto hustle and trade in a loose network of shops run by their diminished family.It is Alpha everybody worries about . 
He sickens easily , he wo n't often leave theamputees ' camp . 
You walk with him around town and you discover that when a22-year-old with girlfriends and gold watches and a reputation in theneighborhood has his arm chopped off while lying face down in the road , he losessomething other than a useful limb . 
He becomes a spectacle , a source ofpolitical meaning , an object of pity , an object of disgust . 
" Look at what the bastards did ! " 
onlookers call out in anger as we walk alongthe road where the rebels had escorted him the year before.Alpha is staring at the eroded red clay . 
" Right now , walking with you , I feel ashamed , " he tells me . 
" I have no fitness.They are pitying me . 
" They are , of course . 
If he sits in the cashier 's chair at his sister-in-law ' svegetable stall , customers will simply walk up to him and hand him money -- notfor vegetables , but for him . 
It infuriates him . 
" I would rather have died than be living like this , " he says softly.We reach the school gate where <PERSON>Tommy</PERSON> stood a year earlier . 
Alpha points out thespots where the line formed , where the boys lay down , where the axe fell.He doubles over . 
He is not feeling well . 
We need to go back down the hill . 
Weneed to take him to the doctor . 
" My arm hurts , " <PERSON>Alpha says.Steve Coll</PERSON> is The Post 's managing editor . 
He will be fielding questions andcomments about this article at www.washingtonpost.com/liveonline on <DATE>Monday</DATE> at 1p .
