On the first day , after revised revenue estimates freedup an additional <MONEY>$ 3 million</MONEY> to <MONEY>$ 5 million</MONEY> , the mayor expanded it , adding 2,126 participants , which he said emptied the waiting list . 
( More than 20,000 hadoriginally registered . ) 
The expansion cost <MONEY>$ 2.5 million.Officials</MONEY> said this year 's program saw far fewer complaints of payroll problemsand " kid-dumping " - or sending participants to work sites where they had nothingto do , as happened in recent years.But the program still had its share of mix-ups .

Itsdirector , <PERSON>Veronica Nolan</PERSON> , said the program 's success should be judged on theskills and experience that participants gain . 
" The city needs to decide what is the purpose of the <DATE>summer</DATE> jobs program - is ita crime prevention strategy , in which case it makes sense to hire as many youthsas possible , or is it a quality jobs program that gets youths on the right trackto a viable career ? "
