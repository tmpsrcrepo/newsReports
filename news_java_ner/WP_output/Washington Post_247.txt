Ferrell and <PERSON>Hart</PERSON> earneasy laughs , but some jokes miss the point " Get Hard " opens with a tight close-up of Will Ferrell weeping - openly , copiously , theatrically - in what has become his signature gesture of doingsomething banal to an absurd extreme . 
In this scattershot , funny-dumb satire , <ORGANIZATION>Ferrell</ORGANIZATION> plays <PERSON>James</PERSON> , a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> financier whose arrest for fraud interruptshis life as a one-percenter . 
He enlists the help of <PERSON>Darnell</PERSON> ( <PERSON>Kevin Hart</PERSON> ) , theguy who washes his car , to help him prepare for prison , assuming that , if it ' strue that one in three black men will end up behind bars , it 's statisticallylikely that a menial laborer will have done time at some point.In fact , <PERSON>Darnell</PERSON> owns the carwashing company , is a devoted husband and father , and aspires to move his family into a better school district . 
But in exchangefor the down payment on a house , he 's willing , as he explains to his wife , to " be every stereotype [ James ] thinks I am . " 
The result is a fish-out-of-waterbuddy comedy that - when it 's working - also does a smartly scathing job ofsending up privilege , entitlement and crony capitalism : the whole phenomenon , asit 's been said , of being born on third base and thinking you 've hit a triple.Or , as <PERSON>James</PERSON> 's weaselly boss , played by <PERSON>Craig T. Nelson</PERSON> , puts it , starting withnothing : " just me , my computer and an <MONEY>$ 8 million</MONEY> loan from my father . 
" Written by <PERSON>Jay Martel</PERSON> , <PERSON>Ian Roberts</PERSON> , <PERSON>Etan Cohen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Adam McKay</PERSON> , " Get Hard " punctuates those ironic zingers with broader , more low-brow physical set pieces , most of which pivot around <PERSON>Hart</PERSON> 's diminutive height and <PERSON>James</PERSON> 's fear of beingraped in prison.The dubious merit of tiresome " do n't drop the soap " jokes aside , " Get Hard " sometimes veers perilously close to committing the very sins it aspires tocriticize . 
The movie is drenched in gay panic . 
( One of those set pieces takesplace in the bathroom of a <LOCATION>West Hollywood</LOCATION> restaurant where James forces himselfto practice the sexual technique he so fears he 'll have to get used to . ) 
And , when the two men enlist the services of <PERSON>Darnell</PERSON> 's street-toughened cousin , someof those stereotypes <PERSON>Darnell</PERSON> invoked earlier - from gangbangers to twerkinghoochie mamas - come floridly and lazily into play.Still , <PERSON>Ferrell</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hart</PERSON> have a genial , easygoing chemistry and " Get Hard " manages to score more than a few good points about facile assumptions and toxichypocrisy . 
In a patronizing but on-point wish-fulfillment sequence , <PERSON>James helpsDarnell</PERSON> 's cousin to monetize his ill-gotten gains by way of complex computertrading programs , resulting in exponential growth of his portfolio . 
" The stockmarket is gangsta , " one of his minions exclaims .
