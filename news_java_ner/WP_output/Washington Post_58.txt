" Law & Order : SVU 's " <DATE>February</DATE> " sweeps " stunt , in which convicted rapist MikeTyson was cast as an abuse victim , appears to have backfired , ratings-wise . 
About 5.2 million people watched <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> 's episode . 
That 's the long-runningNBC drama 's smallest audience for an original , regularly scheduled episode.Tyson played a death-row inmate who was a victim of childhood abuse and whomurdered one of his abusers . 
The episode finished dead last in its time slotamong the major broadcast nets.NBC does n't talk much about its overall audience , preferring to discuss18-to-49-year-old viewers , who are the currency of prime-time ad sales . 
Here , too , the show suffered a record low for an original , regularly scheduledepisode.Before the episode aired , about 7,000 people signed a petition asking <ORGANIZATION>NBC</ORGANIZATION> torecast the role . 
The petition was created by an ardent " SVU " fan who is a rapesurvivor and who said she felt betrayed by the stunt casting . 
Among those whosigned the petition : " NCIS " star and abuse survivor Pauley Perrette.Tyson was arrested in <DATE>1991</DATE> and charged with raping then-18-year-old Miss BlackAmerica pageant competitor <LOCATION>Desiree Washington</LOCATION> ; he was convicted and served threeyears of a six-year prison sentence.Seen on <PERSON>Katie Couric</PERSON> 's syndicated talk show the day after his guest gig , Tysoncontinued to deny having committed the rape , as he did in an interview with TVGuide magazine shortly before the episode aired . 
" I did n't do anything to her , " <PERSON>Tyson</PERSON> told <PERSON>Couric</PERSON> , adding , " I took advantage ofwomen , but never took advantage of her . 
" <PERSON>Couric</PERSON> 's mostly female audience applauded , and <PERSON>Couric</PERSON> noted that <PERSON>Tyson</PERSON> is stillbeing " hounded " by the conviction , introducing the petition motif . 
" Everybody 's entitled to their opinion , " <PERSON>Tyson</PERSON> conceded of that effort to gethis role recast.NBC ignored the petition request but did move the episode - which originally wasscheduled to air next week - after learning that the date was the eve of aglobal event in support of rape and abuse survivors . 
" Law & Order : SVU " was n't the only show to experience a ratings <DATE>setbackWednesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> , though not on quite the same scale . 
" American Idol " and " Modern Family , " for instance , both scored some of theirsmallest ratings in years . 
And TV-industry pundits spent a portion of Thursdaynavel-gazing about the unusually low rate of people watching TV on a night awashin original programming . 
" Why do you think you were violent towards women , or tended to be abusive towomen ? " 
Couric asked <PERSON>Tyson</PERSON> during the pre-recorded interview . 
" No , no , no , no , no , no , no ! " 
Tyson responded , making it seven in all . 
" In your past , " <PERSON>Couric</PERSON> hastened to add . 
" No , listen - I was violent towards everybody , " he explained.Roberts 's ' GMA ' returnNBC 's " Today " show has beat <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> 's " Good Morning America " four of the past fiveweeks among 25-to-54-year-old viewers . 
So " GMA " was particularly happy toannounce that <PERSON>Robin Roberts</PERSON> would be back in time for the last week of theFebruary sweeps ratings race . 
" GMA " host <PERSON>George Stephanopoulos</PERSON> made the announcement on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> 's show . 
Noless than <PERSON>Hillary Clinton</PERSON> , <LOCATION>Denzel Washington</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Sally Field</PERSON> , <PERSON>Bradley Cooper</PERSON> , <PERSON>Jennifer Lopez</PERSON> and the cast of " Modern Family " weighed in with taped congrats toRobin on her return , which also will happen four days before <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> 's broadcast ofthe <ORGANIZATION>Academy Awards</ORGANIZATION> , pretty much ensuring a " GMA " ratings victory.Sorry , " Today . 
" It was one year ago at the Oscars that <PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> said she started feeling poorly , and that one of her goals was to be back in time for this year 's <ORGANIZATION>Academy Awards</ORGANIZATION> , which are broadcast annually on ABC.Roberts began medical leave from the show in <DATE>August</DATE> to undergo a bone-marrowtransplant after receiving a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , a rareblood disorder.Last <DATE>April</DATE> , " GMA " put an end to " Today 's " 16-year weekly ratings winning streak ( and <DATE>last July</DATE> ended its streak among 25 - to 54-year-olds ) .
