How in the world can a parent not get paranoid reading these files?In camps , cul-de-sacs , basement meetings and cars on the ride home , Boy Scoutswere stalked and assaulted by grown-ups they trusted : their scoutmasters andtroop volunteers.The Boy Scouts of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> " perversion files " - a compendium of pedophiles andhow they operated from the mid-1960s to the early <DATE>1990s</DATE> - were released by courtorder last week . 
I swear , they are the scariest reading around today.Pick a state or home town or place you once passed through on a cross-countrytrip , and I 'll bet you 'll find a case there among the nearly 15,000 pages ofhorror.I read through at least 60 files from troops in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> and theDistrict - letters from scoutmasters detailing suspicions about othervolunteers , letters from parents , court records , arrest reports andheartbreaking accounts of abuse handwritten in awkward boy penmanship.In <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> , the documents introduce us to <PERSON>Eric A. Griffin</PERSON> , an assistantscoutmaster in <LOCATION>Arnold</LOCATION> who was booted from the organization in <DATE>1974</DATE> for allegedlytaking nude photos of boys . 
The Scouts red-flagged him , and that kept him outwhen he tried to volunteer in <LOCATION>Scottsdale</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ariz.</LOCATION> , in <DATE>1976</DATE> . 
But two years later , he managed to get back into Scouting in <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> , according to the files , and was accused of messing around with more boys , including the son of thetroop 's scoutmaster.Griffin , who did n't respond to my calls seeking comment , was convicted of lewdand lascivious conduct with a child under 16 in <LOCATION>Pensacola</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION> , in <DATE>1984</DATE> . 
<LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> prison records indicate that he served 30 days for that crime.Then there is <PERSON>David McDonald Rankin</PERSON> , an Adelphi troop leader who pleaded guiltyin <DATE>1987</DATE> in <ORGANIZATION>Prince George 's County Circuit Court</ORGANIZATION> to making boys perform sex actsto get into his special Scout club called " The Rowdies . " 
<PERSON>Rankin</PERSON> , who also did n'trespond to my phone calls , was sentenced to 15 years in prison.But no charges were ever brought against a troop leader who sent graphic lettersto the Scouts he molested in <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> . 
He then tried - unsuccessfully , thank goodness - to rejoin Scouting when he moved to <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> . 
The handwrittenletters in the court files are stomach-churning , with lots of detail andinstructions to rip them apart and throw them away.The parents , according to the file , never went to the police . 
I tracked the guydown but could n't find any criminal charges against him or any appearance on asex-offender registry . 
I doubt that means there have n't been more victims.The release of the files has been an embarrassment to the <ORGANIZATION>Boy Scouts</ORGANIZATION> , which in2010 finally adopted a policy of requiring local Scout leaders to reportsex-abuse allegations to police . 
" There have been instances where people misused their positions in scouting toabuse children , and , in certain cases , our response to these incidents , and ourefforts to protect youth , were plainly insufficient , inappropriate or wrong , " <PERSON>Wayne Perry</PERSON> , the national president of the <ORGANIZATION>Boy Scouts</ORGANIZATION> , said in a statement lastweek . 
" Where those involved in scouting failed to protect , or , worse , inflictedharm on children , we extend our deepest and sincere apologies . 
" Some of the cases are 50 years old , but the methodology of the perpetratorsdoes n't vary much with the passage of time.The pedophiles jumped from city to city and across state lines . 
And for many , Scouting was n't the only access they had to children . 
Some were teachers , counselors and coaches . 
There was a child psychiatrist and a man who lived atand ran a mini-golf course.In some of the files , you could see the efforts the Boy Scouts made to contain aproblem when they saw one coming.In <DATE>1991</DATE> , they opened up a file on <PERSON>Michael E. Eck</PERSON> , a Boy Scout volunteer inRichmond . 
According to his file , he 'd allegedly been " playing doctor " with theScouts.One of the <ORGANIZATION>West Coast</ORGANIZATION> lawyers involved in forcing the Boy Scouts to make thefiles public , <PERSON>Tim Kosnoff</PERSON> , sent me a more detailed file on Eck than the summaryavailable online . 
In it , boys wrote wrenching letters about a man they trusted.He made them sit back as he " practiced " on their bodies for " a medical exam " hewas supposedly about to take to become an EMT . 
The Boy Scouts refused to allowEck to volunteer any longer , despite a rambling , desperate letter that ' sincluded in his file begging to be let back in.End of story ? 
Sadly , no.Three years later , Eck showed up in a <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> court on a sexual battery chargeinvolving a minor . 
That got him a 12-month suspended sentence , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> courtrecords show . 
Then , in <DATE>1999</DATE> , according to court files , he got acquainted withU.S . 
marshals on a federal child-porn charge . 
He spent more than three years injail before being released on <DATE>March 28 , 2003</DATE> , according to federal Bureau ofPrison records.Eck did respond to my repeated calls . 
These days , besides stints as thecoordinator of wine-country events around central <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , he also keepscurrent residence on the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Justice</ORGANIZATION> 's sex - offender registry.Many former scoutmasters live on that Web site , where their repeated offenses , even after the Boy Scouts booted them , are documented.Like <PERSON>David Culver</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Elkton</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION> , who was sentenced to 51 / 2 years after beingconvicted of assaulting two Scouts in <DATE>1979</DATE> , according to the Boy Scout files.Once he got out , he moved on to victims in <LOCATION>Delaware</LOCATION> , where he was convicted ofmore sexual assaults in <DATE>1996</DATE> , according to federal sex - offender records.There 's one of the more famous villains , <PERSON>Alan Horowitz</PERSON> , a Harvard-educated childpsychiatrist who had a whole repertoire of ways to get to little boys . 
Beforepleading guilty to assaulting two boys in <DATE>1983</DATE> in the <LOCATION>Western Maryland</LOCATION> town ofSmithsburg , he had been a scoutmaster in <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> . 
He later made an all-outeffort to reenter Scouting in Iowa.In this case , the Scout 's system worked , and the red flags kept him away frommore Boy Scouts . 
He turned instead to assaulting his patients and thestepchildren of the family he married into in <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> , according to courtrecords . 
He is in prison in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> . 
Throw away the key , please.There are plenty of files with horrible , vivid details of the things that theyoung Scouts had the courage to reveal but no adult had the courage to pursue.In <DATE>1983</DATE> , a married scoutmaster in <LOCATION>Western Maryland</LOCATION> allegedly pursued an EagleScout , repeatedly asking him for oral sex . 
The Scout finally reported it . 
Hisparents were outraged but said they did n't want to hurt Scouting . 
So they agreednot to call police if the Scouts simply removed the guy . 
What do you think he ' sbeen doing since then?Silence , shielding and shunting offenders are ruinous techniques when it comesto something as serious as child sex abuse . 
That 's been true within the CatholicChurch and other religious denominations , our public schools and youth sports.Just this month , we learned that a beloved children 's television host inBritain , the late <PERSON>Jimmy Savile</PERSON> , may have abused about 300 victims over severaldecades.I shudder to think about the damage done by troop leaders who were exiled by theBoy Scouts , then disappeared . 
Research tells us child molesters do n't just quit.They go on to live among us , to keep stalking and hurting . 
They move to otherstates and become <DATE>summer</DATE> camp volunteers or work at a <ORGANIZATION>Boys & Girls Club</ORGANIZATION> . 
Andthey know how to put themselves in places where we trust them with our children.Jerry <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> , anyone?Maybe the spate of high-profile sex-abuse scandals of the past decade means weare finally getting past our secrecy and denial . 
But even today , when it comesto keeping our kids safe , paranoia can be a healthy thing.dvorakp@washpost.comTwitter: @petuladTo read previous columns , go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak.CORRECTION-DATE: <DATE>November 7</DATE> , 2012CORRECTION : In the <PERSON>Petula Dvorak</PERSON> column in the <DATE>Oct. 26</DATE> Metro section , about the Boy Scouts ' " perversion files , " the omission of a word resulted in a sentence that <PERSON>saidMichael E. Eck</PERSON> , one of the men named in the files , " did respond " to phone callsseeking comment . 
Eck did not respond to repeated calls .
