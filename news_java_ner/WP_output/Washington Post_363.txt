I 'm sitting in a cozy little coffeehouse in <LOCATION>Clarendon</LOCATION> , listening for whispers ofevil . 
It 's an important journalistic mission ; I am trying to rescue anendangered literary cliche , the one about how places carry " echoes of theirpast . " 
Every journalist depends on this cliche when we write our crappy storiesabout Civil War battlefields , or the razing of some venerable stadium , or someneighborhood that was once great and is now grim.I 'm here at the <ORGANIZATION>Java Shack</ORGANIZATION> because I 've been told there are no bad echoes . 
Andyet , by the solemn rules of my craft , there must be . 
The building that the JavaShack occupies used to belong to the <ORGANIZATION>American Nazi Party</ORGANIZATION> . 
Back in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> , afulminating racist named <PERSON>George Lincoln Rockwell</PERSON> held court here , plotting worldconquest.How bad was <ORGANIZATION>Rockwell</ORGANIZATION> ? 
Well , he kept a candlelit shrine to <PERSON>Adolf Hitler</PERSON> . 
He worea swastika armband , believed that black men just want to " loaf , loot and rape , " and he publicly advocated the imprisonment of homosexuals and the gassing ofJews . 
He did have a softer , artistic side : He also founded a music companycalled <ORGANIZATION>Hatenanny Records</ORGANIZATION> , featuring the song stylings of <PERSON>Odis Cochran</PERSON> and theThree Bigots.So I 'm hoping for the worst , aura-wise , but so far , things are not going well.The <ORGANIZATION>Java Shack</ORGANIZATION> seems like a friendly place , with a wooden rocking horse forchildren , a featured quiche of the day , yogurt muffins and " free trade " coffeethat costs a little more because the South Americans who harvest the beans get aliving wage . 
The light bulbs are energy-savers , and the Styrofoam is made fromcorn , not petroleum . 
The guy behind the counter is dark-skinned , as is the womanin the corner , talking to her white friend . 
The owner , <PERSON>Dale Roberts</PERSON> , is gay.Hey , <PERSON>Dale</PERSON> , do you let Jews in here ? " 
' Scuse me ? 
" You know , money-grubbing Christ-killers ? 
" Oh . 
Right . 
Sure ! 
" Dale 's laughing . 
He still gets letters sometimes , addressed to the Nazis.There 's a pile of them next to the cash register.These could be the evil vibes I am looking for , except they 're too pathetic toqualify . 
They 're all postmarked from prisons and are mostly written incurlicued , second-grade cursive , like this one that begins , " I 've been a racistsince <DATE>March of '95</DATE> . . . " Here 's one that ends so bizarrely that I take a pictureof it with my cellphone : I tell Dale I 'm looking for echoes of the past . 
They 're gone , he says . 
He gotrid of them with magic . . . ' Scuse me ? 
" In the first few years after we opened , there were eerie sounds . 
Things werespontaneously falling off the shelves . 
I hung a pink neon triangle in the backof the shop , and one day it fell off the wall for no reason and shattered into40 pieces . 
So this reiki master came in , and she purified the place usingburning sage . 
Then all the stuff stopped . 
" This is n't helping my cause . 
" Echoes of the past " ca n't be so weak a cliche thatit can be negated by some mystic lady with a burning herb . 
Newspapers do n't evenrecognize the supernatural . 
It 's not part of our Mission.I am about to give up hope when I decide to visit the <ORGANIZATION>Java Shack</ORGANIZATION> again . 
Bingo!In the corner sits a bearded man in a long coat , muttering to himself , hunchedover a laptop that the store makes available for its clientele at a buck anhour . 
He is literally pounding the keys , stopping every once in a while toglance furtively around . 
He looks like a <DATE>1920s</DATE> anarchist . 
The guy comes in fromtime to time , <PERSON>Dale</PERSON> says , and types so intensely that he once actually broke thekeyboard . 
No one knows what kind of stuff he is sending out onto the Internet.I tap him on the shoulder , and he whips around like he 's been assaulted.Can we talk a sec ? 
" No ! " 
he snarls . 
" I 'm busy , doing important work . 
" What I do next is not taught in J-school . 
It is rude and sneaky . 
But I have toknow what demonic plans he is hatching , helpless in the thrall of whatever foulauras linger . 
I stealthily creep up behind him and peep over his shoulder . 
Thisis what he is typing into an Internet discussion group : " In my opinion , <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> , <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> , <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> , <PERSON>Huckabee</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kucinich</PERSON> are the best choicesfor real change .
