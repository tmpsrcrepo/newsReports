Before buying a house in <LOCATION>Bethesda</LOCATION> <DATE>last month</DATE> , <PERSON>Susan Fiorella</PERSON> tapped away on herkeyboard . 
She researched schools . 
She checked crime statistics . 
She evensolicited opinions about neighborhoods from an e-mail group for urban moms anddads . 
" A lot of people do n't need to be as rigorous to develop this kind of comfortlevel , " said <PERSON>Fiorella</PERSON> , a strategist for a health-care provider and the mother oftwo young children . 
" We did exhaustive research ; that 's our personality . 
" In an era when Googling has become a national pastime , schools , policedepartments , businesses and governments are making it easier to researchneighborhoods , lessening the chances of buyer 's remorse.Many school Web sites , for example , post test scores and write about specialofferings such as magnet programs . 
Some police departments provide statistics oncrime in specific areas . 
Some county governments post locations of parks andneighborhood master plans . 
A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government Web site even pinpoints locationsof sex offenders , down to a specific block . 
" I recommend to all my purchasers : Familiarize yourself with the neighborhoodbefore you write the offer , " said <PERSON>Judi Seiden</PERSON> , an associate broker forPrudential <ORGANIZATION>Carruthers Realtors</ORGANIZATION> on Capitol Hill.Said <PERSON>Joel Abalos</PERSON> , an agent at <ORGANIZATION>Keller Williams Realty of Fairfax Gateway</ORGANIZATION> inFairfax : " You do n't want to sell a house to somebody and two weeks after closingthey find out there 's a rapist next door . 
" In the <ORGANIZATION>BTI</ORGANIZATION> era -- Before the Internet -- would-be buyers or their real estateagents often ran around to gather information packets from schools , librariesand government offices . 
The Web has changed that . 
" It 's made it much easier , " said <PERSON>Robyn Burdett</PERSON> , an agent with <ORGANIZATION>Re/Max Allegiancein Fairfax</ORGANIZATION> . 
" It 's taken away a lot of the legwork , and I want to say the unknownis gone . 
" She said , " Just going to the Metro Web site , my client can figure out the busschedule for the park-and-ride and how they all connect and how long they take . 
" Still , when a Web site wo n't quite satisfy , she recommends finding out theold-fashioned way . 
To find out more about a school , for example , she sometimessuggests that clients talk with the principal or call another parent to askquestions . 
" I 've also had clients walk their kids through the school , " she said.One of her clients , <PERSON>Jason Lynch</PERSON> , an ecologist with the <ORGANIZATION>Environmental ProtectionAgency</ORGANIZATION> , is living with relatives in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> area while he researcheshomes and neighborhoods . 
In the meantime , his wife and two daughters , ages 4 and7 , are back home in Illinois.Besides researching schools on the Web , he said , he has been experimenting withcommutes from <LOCATION>Northern Virginia</LOCATION> to the District.As for crime prevalence , he said , he is relying on what his relatives tell him . 
" My brother-in-law has lived in <LOCATION>Reston</LOCATION> for about 25 years , " he said.Real estate agents say federal fair-housing laws limit what they can say about aschool district or neighborhood , particularly when it comes to race andsocioeconomic indicators.Many simply play it safe by referring clients to Web sites or suggesting otherways to assuage concerns . 
Besides , agents say , they fear giving out badinformation . 
" I try to give them as much information as possible by giving them the Websites , locations and the <ORGANIZATION>Montgomery Board of Education</ORGANIZATION> phone numbers , and I tellthem they should do their homework , " said <PERSON>Kris Feldman</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Coldwell BankerResidential Brokerage</ORGANIZATION> in Bethesda.Seiden said she sometime tells clients to visit a block " in the morning whenpeople go to work and in the <TIME>evening</TIME> when they 're coming home -- and feel freeto have a conversation . 
For the most part , everyone is very forthcoming . 
" She added : " For a third check , go late in the <TIME>evening</TIME> and check out the activityand see how comfortable you feel , acknowledging that anything new is going to bestrange . 
If they come back and say , ' Gee I hate it , ' it 's not the house forthem . 
" <PERSON>Abalos</PERSON> , the <LOCATION>Fairfax County</LOCATION> real estate agent , warned that visits alone sometimesgive an incomplete picture . 
" Sometimes people think , driving at night , they can tell if there 's a high crimerate , " he said . 
" I do n't think it 's accurate . 
It 's better to call the police andcheck statistics . 
" Some police department Web sites , including those for the District and PrinceGeorge 's County , provide a breakdown of crime statistics by neighborhood , oftenreferred to as crime mapping . 
Some other departments that do n't , such asArlington 's , encourage prospective buyers to contact them . 
" What we do is put them through to our district office , whatever districtthey 're moving into , " said <PERSON>John Lisle</PERSON> , a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Arlington CountyPolice Department</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We get a lot of requests . 
The district office pulls up crimestatistics for a certain period to give them an idea what crime has been like inthe area . 
" Neighborhood e-mail lists or Web sites for communities such as Mount Pleasant inNorthwest <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> ( http://mtpleasantdc.org ) are forums to discussneighborhood issues , activities and crime . 
They can give prospective buyers afeel for the area.For many buyers with children , the bulk of the research focuses on schools . 
Somefree Web sites rank schools nationally . 
And schools themselves normally providea wealth of information on their sites , in some cases the number of incidentsinvolving fights or guns.According to the <LOCATION>Montgomery County</LOCATION> school system 's Web site , for instance , <ORGANIZATION>Ashburton Elementary School</ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION>Lone Oak Drive</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Bethesda</LOCATION> had 570 students inthe 2006-07 school year , of whom <PERCENT>56.1 percent</PERCENT> were white , <PERCENT>12.8 percent Hispanic ,17.5 percent</PERCENT> Asian and <PERCENT>13.5 percent</PERCENT> African American . 
The ratio of students toinstructional staff was 9.7 to 1 . 
Kindergarten classes averaged 23.7 students ; for grades 4 and 5 , average class size was 22 . 
The <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post 's Local Explorer service , at http://www.washingtonpost.com/localexplorer , provides neighborhood-driven local news as well as mappinginformation about home sales , businesses , schools and crime.Other commercial Web sites such as Homefair.com provide not only schoolinformation but also profiles of cities . 
Typing a Zip code brings upneighborhood data breaking down the population into categories : male and female ; married , divorced and widowed ; average household income ; ethnic and racialbackground ; and education level . 
The site also provides crime statistics andaverage home sale prices.Jean Lin , a lawyer who moved from <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Bethesda</LOCATION> with her husband , also alawyer , focused her Internet research on schools , comparing two or threedistricts . 
She checked math and English scores and other data.She said she 's not even sure her kids , now 1 and 3 years old , will ever attendthe high schools in the areas she examined . 
However , she said , " We also knewfrom our limited experience there 's a correlation between good school districtsand how well a house keeps its value . 
" For some parents , knowing whether there 's a sex offender in the neighborhood isimportant , real estate agents said.One of the better Web sites for that is the <ORGANIZATION>Dru Sjodin National Sex OffenderPublic Registry</ORGANIZATION> , run by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> and named after a woman whowas killed by a convicted offender . 
Typing in a Zip code produces a list ofoffenders , with photos and locations.For example , in the 20015 Zip code in upper <LOCATION>Northwest Washington</LOCATION> , two sexoffenders were listed : one 66 years old , the other 75 . 
The victims of both werechildren . 
In <LOCATION>Chantilly</LOCATION> , Zip code 20152 had two registered sex offenders : a38-year-old man convicted of taking indecent liberties with a child and a59-year-old man convicted of third-degree sexual assault.Ron Sitrin , a real estate agent for <ORGANIZATION>Long & Foster</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Friendship Heights</LOCATION> , alsowarned that prospective buyers should check the government master plan for aneighborhood . 
Some governments , such as <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> counties , postthem on their Web sites.The key , he said , is to avoid unwelcome surprises . 
" You want to make sure you ' renot buying on a single-lane road that 's getting ready to double in size . "
