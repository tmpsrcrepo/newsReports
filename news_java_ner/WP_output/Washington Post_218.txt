Dear Carolyn : A 17-year-old girl meets a gorgeous guy , flirts with him and asks him out . 
Hetakes her to a motel . 
He kisses her , she kisses him back . 
He keeps going , shesays stop . 
He continues . 
She tells him that it hurts and tries to push him offher . 
He tells her he is almost done and to let him finish.Is it her fault since she asked him out ? 
It 's been three years , but sometimes itfeels like it just happened . 
Does the fear ever go away ? 
-- AnonymousIt is NOT your fault for asking him out.It is NOT your fault that " no " was n't enough.It is NOT your fault that he was stronger than you were.It is NOT your fault that a sloppy , ugly excuse for a man took advantage of yourinnocence and your trusting nature , and raped you.This fear he forced upon you is something you can confront and seize anddismantle , to the point where some days you wo n't know it 's there . 
But you needto talk to someone who can walk you through this process and show you the waysyou can mend . 
The Rape , <ORGANIZATION>Abuse & Incest National Network</ORGANIZATION> ( RAINN ) has aconfidential hot line , 1-800-656-HOPE , that can steer you to a counselor nearyou who understands what you 've been through and will guide you as long as youneed . 
It 's an amazing thing , if you think about it -- punch 11 numbers and startto get your life back . 
Please write back and tell me you did.Hi <PERSON>Carolyn</PERSON> : I moved in a couple of months ago with roommates . 
We 've been going out a lottogether with their friends -- we all really get along . 
I 've had severalout-of-town guests who have come out with us , too . 
The problem is that a friendof one of my roommates keeps hitting on whoever is visiting me . 
He 's a bigplayer , very blatant , and does n't seem too discriminating about the person.After three weeks of this , I want to tell him to stop hitting on my friendsunless he really likes them , but I do n't know if it 's appropriate , since he 's myroommate 's friend , not mine . 
The complication here is that he and I hooked up amonth ago and things have been rocky between us . 
-- CaliforniaWelcome to another round of Find the Motives!You want to hunt this guy down and scold him , ostensibly shielding your friends.That 's so good of you . . . except that you could accomplish the same thing bysimply warning them all what he 's like.If what you really want is to broadcast how badly he hurt you , then telling himoff will work great . 
But it sounds like you just want to win one , to have anexcuse to say , hey , I did n't want you anyway . 
I get it . 
It 's frustrating to beburned and worse to just sit there and take it.Still , that does n't make his behavior your business -- and you do n't own yourfriends , either , for that matter . 
If they want to get hit on , that 's their call.If he wants to hit , he can hit . 
This is strictly a case of free will ; whetherhe 's your friend or someone else 's really has nothing to do with it . 
You " own " your story ; share it with your friends and be done with it.Dear <PERSON>Carolyn</PERSON> : My brother is handsome , funny , generous and successful . 
He 's also nearly 30 andsingle . 
He dates often , but there has never been a girlfriend whom we thought hefelt seriously about . 
My married older sister has asked me if I thought he mightbe gay . 
I wanted to tell her that he probably took one look at her shallow , pathetic suburban life and swore off marriage and kids forever . 
I did n't , ofcourse , but now she 's talking to my other sisters about it . 
And naturally she ' sacting like his being gay would be the end of the world . 
We 're from aconservative family , but I would have thought my sisters would be moreopen-minded about their own brother . 
How do I get her to shut up and mind herown business ? 
-- New JerseyNearly 30 ! 
And single !! 
Order the His-and-His towels !!! 
If you do n't mind my saying , and I strongly suspect that you wo n't , yoursister 's an [ unprintable two-syllable word for shallow and pathetic ] . 
Normally , the best way to treat one of those is to ignore it and let its foulness speakfor itself.But in this case , it sounds like your brother has n't been allowed to speak forhim self , so you have to do it for him . 
Explain to Miss Congeniality thatwhatever she " thinks " on this subject , she can take it up with the brother.Click.You ca n't force her pie-hole shut , but you can let her know you deplore everyword that it says . 
Indulging her homophobia -- even hearing her out -- is a blatantbetrayal of him . 
Your sisters should hear that as well , from you , now . 
As shouldhe ; when were you planning to tell him?Write to Tell Me About It , Style Plus , <DATE>1150</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>15th St. NW</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> 20071or tellme@washpost.com, and join <PERSON>Carolyn</PERSON> 's live discussion at noon <DATE>Fridays</DATE> or 3p .
