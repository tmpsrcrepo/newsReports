We have to face the ugliness and deal with it.Jesse <PERSON>Ryan Loskarn</PERSON> could n't , and because of that , one tragedy became another andanother . 
And yes , the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> staffer is a victim - and an abuser , too.Loskarn , 35 , spoke from the grave this week in a sad , searing letter heapparently wrote before hanging himself in his parents ' basement.The chief of staff for Sen. <PERSON>Lamar Alexander</PERSON> ( R-Tenn . ) 
was arrested last monthafter a child pornography investigation led to his Capitol Hill home , where hetried to hide a computer hard drive that contained seriously horrid films ofchildren being raped.Loskarn had these films for a couple of years . 
After going to committeemeetings , campaign fundraisers and Hill happy hours , he came home and watched , according to court charging documents , a video of a young girl being raped inthe woods . 
And hundreds of others like that . 
While watching them , he wrote inhis letter , he " felt a connection . 
" He spent 30 years feeling alone . 
And then he found others like him . 
" He found out that he was n't alone through the child porn , " said <PERSON>Curtis St.John</PERSON> , a sexual abuse survivor who tries to help others through a network calledMaleSurvivor . 
" He found the same scenarios that he was put through . 
" Loskarn did n't find a sense of belonging through support groups or PoliticoPlaybook microfame or in the bottom of happy-hour glasses . 
He foundcompanionship in child porn . 
" I found myself drawn to videos that matched my own childhood abuse , " he wrote . 
" It 's painful and humiliating to admit to myself , let alone the whole world , butI pictured myself as a child in the image or video . 
The more an image mirroredsome element of my memories and took me back , the more I felt a connection . 
" I know . 
Ugly . 
Really ugly . 
And that 's the problem.Loskarn used that letter , which his mother posted online this week , to divulgethat he had been sexually abused when he was ages 5 and 9 , somewhere in theMaryland suburb of <PERSON>Carroll</PERSON> County.We do n't know who abused him . 
It could have been anyone . 
Statistics say it wassomeone he knew and trusted - about three-quarters of abusers are a friend , teacher , coach or family member.We do n't know if <LOCATION>Loskarn</LOCATION> 's parents knew about his abuse . 
Sounds like they did n'tbecause <PERSON>Loskarn</PERSON> said he had n't told anyone until he was on suicide watch at theD.C . 
jail after his <DATE>Dec. 11</DATE> arrest , and one perceptive counselor drew it out ofhim.Before that , he felt alone , even though he never was . 
" If you know more than six men , then you know someone who has been abused , " saidSt . 
John , who kept silent until his abuser , middle-school teacher AlbertFentress , went on to abuse , kill and cannibalize a teenage boy in his home townof <LOCATION>Poughkeepsie</LOCATION> , N.Y.Then , when St. <PERSON>John</PERSON> showed up to testify at a parole hearing , he ran into hisbest friend , who had been abused , too . 
They were both in their own privatehells , keeping quiet , being stoic , sparing everyone from the ugliness.Loskarn did that , too . 
" As a child I did n't understand what had happened at the time of the abuse , " hewrote . 
" I did know that I must not tell anyone , ever . 
In my mind I instigated andenjoyed the abuse - even as a five and nine year old - no matter the agedifference . 
Discussing what had happened would have meant shame and blame . 
" The cycle of abuse continued when Loskarn bought and watched child porn.Certainly , most victims do not go on to become abusers . 
And all abusers were n'tonce victims , said <PERSON>Scott Berkowitz</PERSON> , president and founder of RAINN , the Rape , Abuse and <ORGANIZATION>Incest National Network</ORGANIZATION> , based in <ORGANIZATION>Northwest</ORGANIZATION> Washington.But the culture of silence is the most dangerous incubator of abuse.Loskarn was not innocent and made it clear that he knew what he was doing waswrong . 
His history as a victim is an explanation but not an excuse.He 's guilty , but so are we . 
Because we are a society so reluctant to confrontsexual abuse , to go beyond oversimplified " good touch/bad touch " explanations , to call police , we are perpetuating the cycle , too . 
Being a victim of sexualabuse is so taboo in our society , <PERSON>Loskarn</PERSON> made it a badge of honor in his mind . 
" I told myself that I was superior to other people because I had dealt with thisthing on my own , " he wrote . 
" In retrospect , the qualities that helped me succeedon Capitol Hill were probably developed partly as a result of the abuse and howit shaped me . 
" He did not , in the end , succeed in dealing with repercussions on his own.Instead , he became an abuser himself , trafficking in other children 's misery andthen taking his own life amid the guilt and shame.If only it had been okay for him - and for us - to talk about the ugliness.Maybe Loskarn would still be alive.petula.dvorak@washpost.comTwitter: @petulad Ã¯ ...
