From <TIME>8 a.m.</TIME> until just before dark <DATE>Monday</DATE> , the female veterans told theirstories . 
" I 'd go into the medical closet and cry , cry , cry , " one said . 
" The men got Purple Hearts . 
We got broken hearts , " another said . 
" The sound . 
That sound of the helicopter . 
You heard that sound , and you knewmore were coming , " another woman said.For more than two decades , <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> did n't want to hear the stories of nurses andother women who served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> . 
They were scorned and disrespected.When they began pushing for a memorial to the women who served , detractorsworried that would open the floodgates to even more memorials - such as forscout dogs.But supporters said the fantastic , perfect <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> Veterans Memorial by <PERSON>Maya Lin</PERSON> - the Wall - was nevertheless incomplete . 
Then-Sen . 
Frank <PERSON>Murkowski</PERSON> ( R-Alaska ) said during one of the <DATE>1988</DATE> congressional hearings that there was a " void . 
" <PERSON>Larry Sudweeks</PERSON> knows about that . 
" <PERSON>Larry</PERSON> had this hole . 
Like a big old void , " said <PERSON>Larry</PERSON> 's wife , <PERSON>Loretta Sudweeks</PERSON> , as she pointed to <PERSON>Larry</PERSON> 's chest.The void in <PERSON>Sudweeks</PERSON> 's life goes back to his time in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> , where he spent 45days in the <ORGANIZATION>93rd Evacuation Hospital</ORGANIZATION> in Long Binh.He knew it was the nurses who kept him alive . 
Once they made him strong enough , he was flown home , back to family and away from that place of blood and gauzeand death . 
Another broken , dying soldier took his bed before <PERSON>Sudweeks</PERSON> got achance to thank them or even get their names.His was a common experience . 
" I ca n't remember your name , but I just wanted to say thanks for saving mylife , " read one of the notes left on the Mall on <DATE>Monday</DATE> . 
It was signed " One ofMany . 
" The rest of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> had the same problem : never getting the women 's names , neverhaving the time to thank them.It was n't until <DATE>1993</DATE> that the <LOCATION>Vietnam Women</LOCATION> 's Memorial was dedicated to honorthe ones who volunteered to serve , who stayed while others were flown out , whodid the comforting but were never comforted.There was no draft for women . 
About 11,000 - most of them nurses - raised theirhands and went over on their own.A few hundred of them came to the women 's memorial in the District to remember , talk , embrace , share and celebrate the 20th anniversary of their memorial - andtwo decades of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> finally acknowledging their service.Sudweeks , 66 , finally got to say thanks , too.He lives in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> . 
And he came to the Wall a couple of years ago to see thenames of his buddies who died , to get closure . 
" But he kept circling that women 's memorial ; he was drawn to it , " <PERSON>Loretta said.He</PERSON> still did n't know who the women were who saved him.Meanwhile , <PERSON>Annie Koch Voigt</PERSON> , 68 , one of the women who kept him alive , wonderedabout him , too . 
This was many , many years after those dark days of war . 
Afterchildren and grandchildren and other wars.Voigt had this one picture she took of a wounded soldier on Easter <DATE>Sunday</DATE> , whenthey all wore nurse whites rather than their fatigues . 
And it haunted her.She remembered his unusual name . 
She remembered that he was nice and courteous.Most men spent a couple of days at her evacuation hospital , then were flownaway . 
But <PERSON>Sudweeks</PERSON> was there for weeks and in bad condition.Part of her did n't want to learn his fate . 
You never knew who made it and whodid n't . 
And sometimes , it was best not to know.And part of her did n't want to revisit that time in her life . 
Like the men , thewomen who served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> were often scorned when they returned to <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> . 
Itwas especially bad for women , who were judged as harlots for having served amongthe men . 
The television show " M * A * S * H " did n't help , either . 
They 'd say " Armynurse , " and all people heard was " Hot Lips Houlihan . 
" Many of them folded their uniforms , put away their caps and stayed silent abouttheir service.Not anymore.There is a new wave of female veterans , including women who saw combat and wereinjured or lost friends on the battlefield . 
" We talk to the women who are out there now , " said <ORGANIZATION>Army 1st</ORGANIZATION> . 
Lt. <PERSON>Brenda Jansons</PERSON> , who came up from <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> for Veterans Day . 
She still suffers from PTSDfrom her time in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> . 
" And you know what ? 
Their story is our story.Nothing 's changed . 
" That 's true in the saddest of ways . 
" There 's a secondary war , " said <PERSON>Jennie Rose</PERSON> , 66 , a retired <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> lieutenantcolonel . 
" The sexual assault of women is the secondary war on them . 
And it 's there andit 's very , very real , " she said , pointing to herself and another female veteran . 
" We both lived through it . 
" It was Gen. <PERSON>Colin Powell</PERSON> who first publicly thanked the nurses who saved him . 
" General <PERSON>Powell</PERSON> said words we 'd never heard before , " said <PERSON>Diane Carlson Evans</PERSON> , president and founder of the <ORGANIZATION>Vietnam Women</ORGANIZATION> 's Memorial Foundation.Powell dedicated that memorial 20 years ago and returned to the Mall on Mondayto remind <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> what women had done in that war . 
" The nurses were the ones who never got respite , " he said , and he askedeveryone , on this Veterans Day , to give thanks " especially to the women whoserved silently . 
" <PERSON>Voigt</PERSON> decided to end her silence . 
She looked up <PERSON>Sudweeks</PERSON> 's unusual name andfound his address in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> . 
She mailed him the picture , the details of hiswounds and her memories . 
" It took me three or four tries to finish reading that card , " <PERSON>Sudweeks</PERSON> said . 
" Itwas her . 
" At the memorial , <PERSON>Loretta</PERSON> and <PERSON>Larry Sudweeks</PERSON> and <PERSON>Voigt</PERSON> hugged.And <PERSON>Larry Sudweeks</PERSON> finally said , " Thank you .
