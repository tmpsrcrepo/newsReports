CRIMINALS SEEMED to have hijacked <ORGANIZATION>Prince George 's County</ORGANIZATION> three years ago . 
Therewere two carjackings a day and more than three murders a week . 
Rapes andburglaries were out of hand . 
The police chief at the time did n't help byconcluding that the problem was lazy officers . 
One fed-up resident , no doubtspeaking for many , wrote in early <DATE>2006</DATE> in The Post , " When my neighbors and Ihear those numbers , we wonder if this really is where we want to live , where wewant to bring up our children . " 
Since then , the county has achieved a remarkableturnaround . 
At a time when crime is rising in some neighboring jurisdictions , the violence continues to wane in <ORGANIZATION>Prince George 's</ORGANIZATION> . 
The county is safer than it ' sbeen in years as a result of an injection of resources from the countygovernment and improved communication between officers and residents.The drop in crime has occurred across the board : Assaults , robberies , propertycrimes and homicides are all down by more than <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> since <DATE>2005</DATE> . 
Carjackings , which had reached epidemic levels , have plummeted an astonishing 60percent . 
Only burglary has inched upward.There 's no single reason for the drop , but increased funding , a priority ofCounty Executive <PERSON>Jack B. Johnson</PERSON> ( D ) , has been instrumental . 
The policedepartment 's budget has grown by about <PERCENT>77 percent</PERCENT> , to <MONEY>$ 256.6 million</MONEY> , sincefiscal <DATE>2003</DATE> , according to the county <ORGANIZATION>Office of Management and Budget</ORGANIZATION> . 
Policestaffing has increased by about 450 positions , to 2,132 . 
A larger , better-fundedforce has arrested <PERCENT>40 percent</PERCENT> more suspects since <DATE>2005</DATE> . 
Other factors that have contributed : <ORGANIZATION>Justice Department</ORGANIZATION> scrutiny has improvedthe training of new officers ; the county government has limited liquor storehours and shut down illegal nightclubs ; and police officials have worked withproperty owners in high-crime areas to make apartments and businesses moresecure . 
Acting Police Chief <PERSON>Roberto L. Hylton</PERSON> , who took over the force lastsummer , gets crime updates every 15 minutes and seems to have brought neededenergy to the department.Even Chief <PERSON>Hylton</PERSON> acknowledges , however , that the perception of the departmentcontinues to lag reality . 
As one wary resident told <ORGANIZATION>The Post</ORGANIZATION> 's <PERSON>Aaron C. Davis</PERSON> , " It 's too soon for me to feel any safer . " 
Any amount of crime is too much , andpotential public safety cuts , brought by a county budget deficit , may threatensome of the gains . 
Still , residents should take pride and comfort in thereduction in crime.Do you have a different view of this issue ?
