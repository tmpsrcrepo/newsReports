Before <DATE>summer</DATE> goes into full swing , parents and students should know that somechildren fall behind academically and others jump ahead during the break . 
Thedifference seems to be that some do little besides watch television , whileothers read and become engaged with the world.Parents should make sure that their children 's library cards are up to date andused weekly . 
Let them choose a dozen books at a time on whatever subjectsinterest them . 
If they have trouble choosing , ask the librarian for suggestions.Read together . 
If your children are reluctant readers , try to entice them withmagazines . 
Wonderful ones are available and sometimes are less intimidating tokids than books.While at the library , discover <ORGANIZATION>Howard County</ORGANIZATION> 's wonderful community resources forchildren . 
For example , the county recreation department holds all sorts ofevents , such as races and concerts and classes in art , music , rock climbing andbasketball , to name a few . 
If the fees are prohibitive , ask for a scholarship.If your library does n't have recreation department brochures , visitwww.co.ho.md.us / recparks/rpcat . 
htm . 
You can use computers at the library . 
I ' venever met a librarian who was n't happy to show people how . 
Also , visit some ofthe amazing places in this area -- the Inner Harbor in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> , theSmithsonian museums , the <LOCATION>Shenandoah</LOCATION> mountains and the <LOCATION>Chesapeake Bay</LOCATION> . 
Thesekinds of field trips are not expensive and help to open children 's minds to theworld 's possibilities in ways that are difficult to calculate.In Homeroom <DATE>June 7</DATE> , I discussed the school system 's policy of open enrollment , which led to some <ORGANIZATION>Howard County</ORGANIZATION> schools having too many students and others toofew . 
Many underenrolled schools are in <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and tend to have higher numbersof poor , African American and Latino students . 
To stop what some consider whiteflight , the school system issued a moratorium on open enrollment and recentlyextended it for a year . 
I received interesting responses , including thefollowing.Dear Homeroom : You asked people who have moved so their children could attend a more desirableschool why they moved . 
When I then read the front page article of our localnewspaper , the <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Flier</ORGANIZATION> , I had to laugh at your question . 
The article wasabout a girl attacked by three boys at recess at <ORGANIZATION>Hammond Middle School</ORGANIZATION> when onlyone adult was outside supervising her entire grade . 
Although the perpetratorswere suspended for 11 days , they were allowed to return to the school.The victim now has a home tutor and is afraid to return to school . 
You can betyour last dollar that her family will be moving as soon as they can afford it toget their daughter into a safer school . 
Plus , any parents in that schooldistrict who have the money will most likely open enroll elsewhere or move a fewmiles to a better school.When your school caters to the troublemakers ( who have been charged with sexualassault by <ORGANIZATION>Howard County</ORGANIZATION> police ) , it is time to switch schools or just move . 
Bydisallowing open enrollment , you just make the " white flight " happen morequickly.Make no mistake about it . 
Parents pay what it costs to move where they get theschool they want . 
So much moving around makes the neighborhoods lesscommunity-minded . 
Sandy GrahamClarksvilleThe incident at <ORGANIZATION>Hammond Middle School</ORGANIZATION> was certainly disturbing . 
A seventh-gradegirl was beaten and badly bruised by other students , and police have chargedthree boys with assault and sexual <PERSON>assault.Patti Caplan</PERSON> , the school system spokeswoman , said appropriate disciplinaryaction was taken but would not confirm whether the students were suspended . 
Shedid , however , confirm that only one adult -- an assistant principal -- wassupervising recess at the time . 
Normally two adults are there , she said , but thesecond was called away . 
At the mother 's request , <PERSON>Caplan</PERSON> said , the girl is beingtaught at home by an instructor provided by the school system.Determining facts in such cases is always very difficult , in part because schoolsystems have an obligation to protect a student 's privacy . 
However , biggerissues involve how safe children and their parents feel in schools . 
As you pointout , parents will move heaven and earth to try keeping their children safe . 
Ifthey perceive that their child 's school is unsafe and they have sufficientresources , they will move . 
If enough people do so , a serious population shiftresults.But flight is not the only option . 
The other is banding as a community anddemanding that schools be made safe . 
One problem faced by many schoolsnationally is that not enough grown-ups are available , particularly in secondaryschools . 
One adult was not enough to supervise recess at <LOCATION>Hammond</LOCATION> , and two mightnot have been either . 
Enough adults must be present so children understand thatthe culture of the school is set by grown-ups , not kids.Caplan said that 's the case at <PERSON>Hammond</PERSON> and that she would n't hesitate to sendher child there . 
But an incident such as this understandably causes unease amongparents and students and requires that the community look closely at what occursin the school.On <DATE>July 1</DATE> , <PERSON>James Pope</PERSON> will become principal at <LOCATION>Hammond</LOCATION> . 
Parents there should askthat he talk with everyone -- parents , faculty , support staff and students -- about the school 's environment to make sure that it 's governed by respect,self-discipline and orderliness.Here 's another response to that column , from someone who asked that she not beidentified.Dear Homeroom : People will only begin to leave a local school when they perceive a real , immediate compromise of their children 's education . 
There was too great adisparity between the underpopulated and overpopulated schools in terms ofnewness , program and staff.Old <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> schools were losing population , and they were old physically , withdiminished programs . 
New schools in the new , outlying developments had spiffyplants and shiny new stuff -- computers and the wiring to support them , forexample.Furthermore , the central office and board permitted new principals to cull thebest teachers from their old schools to take with them to staff the new schools.New schools thus had the advantage of a cohesive team of personnel . 
The oldschools were left with vacancies and an incoming principal.This writer is addressing some of the real difficulties in any rapidly growingschool system where new schools are built . 
I would be interested in otherthoughts from you , so please write .
