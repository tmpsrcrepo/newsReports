<PERSON>Aaron Thomas</PERSON> was scary.He jumped out from behind bushes and lurked in dark corners . 
Women were objects , not people , to this serial rapist , who is scheduled to plead guilty <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> torape and abduction charges in <LOCATION>Prince William County</LOCATION> . 
He said so himself , when hespoke with The <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post.But you know what 's scarier ? 
Guys like him are n't the majority of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> ' srapists.Predators like <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> - who became known as the <ORGANIZATION>East Coast Rapist</ORGANIZATION> after morethan a dozen attacks since the <DATE>1990s</DATE> in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> area and <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> - are the minority.According to the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</ORGANIZATION> , only 13.8 percentof such attacks are by a complete stranger . 
More likely to rape you is a friend , a date or a relative , statistics show.There is a sexual assault in this country every two minutes . 
That means morethan 200,000 a year , according to the D.C.-based Rape Abuse and Incest NationalNetwork ( RAINN ) . 
But <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> is n't a total anomaly . 
That repulsive , cruel inner core that makeshim so cinematically frightening - he hurt other kids , tortured animals and seta girl 's hair on fire - is the same stuff that turns the seemingly nice guysinto serial attackers , too.Remember when we first started talking about date rape and acquaintance rape?The widespread assumption was that these attackers were otherwise nice guys whogot a little too drunk and carried things a bit too far . 
They did n't understandthat just because you 're making out in the dorm room does n't mean it 's an openinvitation to go all the way , right?So we thought that maybe a " No means no " campaign would stop date rapes fromhappening.Well , no , actually.Because most of the people who were doing the raping - acquaintances , friends , dates , family members - knew their victims meant " no , " and that was part of theallure of their crime.Some of the most solid evidence of that has been developed by <PERSON>David Lisak</PERSON> indecades of work . 
The psychology professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Massachusetts atBoston</ORGANIZATION> has surveyed about 2,000 college-age males , about 120 of whom basicallyadmitted to rape and averaged about six rapes each . 
" We 've come to understand , it 's not the innocent guy who has one beer too manyand does something foolish , " said <PERSON>Scott Berkowitz</PERSON> , the president and founder ofRAINN . 
" These are criminals who plan out how they are going to select theirvictims , how they are going to do it . 
" The best example of that caused a furor this <DATE>summer</DATE> , when a thread on Redditasked to hear stories from " the other side of the story " on sexual assault.One Redditor wrote about his tactics . 
He prefaced it by telling everyone he 's areally nice guy , a community activist , volunteer , liked by all and so forth . 
" I am a post-college aged male who raped several girls through use of coercion , alcohol , and other tactics over a course of 3 years , " he explained . 
He got tiredof " all the sluts and sorority girls " who threw themselves at gorgeous him , sohe began getting his thrills by being a predator . 
He was very calculating , looking for small-statured and modest girls and going on at least one veryproper , genteel date.Then he would invite them to his place and rape them.He said that " the great nights were the ones who squirmed , ones who did n't wantto give in . " 
" I 'd have to shush them down , and try to work on them slowly enough so theydid n't know what was going on until it was pretty much already happening , " theman wrote . 
" To be honest , even remembering it now , the squirming always made it better , they did n't want it to happen , but they could n't do anything about it , " he said.This man , as well as the men who admitted to rape in the surveys , did n't believethey were actually rapists . 
And that 's just like <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> , who called it " the Rword " when he talked to The Post 's <PERSON>Josh White</PERSON> about his crimes.Thomas used a fake gun to march three trick-or-treaters into the woods to attackthem . 
He admitted that he started by attacking prostitutes , assuming theywould n't report him . 
And still , he did not consider himself a rapist.Listen to this line from the anonymous <LOCATION>Reddit</LOCATION> rapist : " I did n't know how tostop , and just when I thought maybe I could , I 'd find myself back in my pattern , back on the hunt . 
" That was a sentiment echoed over the phone from the <LOCATION>Prince William County</LOCATION> jail , where the <ORGANIZATION>East Coast Rapist</ORGANIZATION> is being held : " I do n't know why I could n't juststop . 
" The <LOCATION>Reddit</LOCATION> rapist is a self-described college graduate , community volunteer,good-looking husband and successful businessman . 
The <ORGANIZATION>East Coast Rapist</ORGANIZATION> is aconvicted felon , has been homeless , and was violent and utterly impressed withhis own ability to keep getting away with it.Thomas faces the possibility of several life terms in prison.The <LOCATION>Reddit</LOCATION> rapist has never had to answer for his actions . 
He had one thing tosay before he left the conversation this <DATE>summer</DATE> : " Let me leave you with thismessage , you never know who someone truly is , so be careful .
