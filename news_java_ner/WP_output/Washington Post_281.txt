' The <DATE>November</DATE> Man ' is a generic , unthrilling thriller <ORGANIZATION>Pierce Brosnanscowls</ORGANIZATION> his way through the instantly forgettable , unthrilling thriller ' TheNovember Man . ' 
Pierce Brosnan is an ex-spy who looks as bored as the viewers ofhis forgettable new film . 
" The <DATE>November</DATE> Man " is less a movie than cinematic filler , the kind ofaudio-visual wallpaper meant to keep movie screens occupied with bland , instantly forgettable product while " Guardians of the Galaxy " plays itself outand better , smarter movies settle nervously into their gates for the fall awardsrace.For most of this generic , unthrilling thriller , <ORGANIZATION>Pierce Brosnan</ORGANIZATION> practices - unsuccessfully - a sexy scowl , an expression that makes him look either tetchyor mildly peeved , depending on how many explosions he 's dodging . 
Brosnan playsan ex-CIA agent named <PERSON>Devereaux</PERSON> who is pulled back into service by his old matesand winds up in the middle of a shadowy conspiracy involving a sleazy Russianpolitician and some dubious doings in Chechnya.His ally in this shifting landscape of loyalties and misplaced trust is astatuesque social worker named <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> ( the eye-popping <PERSON>Olga Kurylenko</PERSON> ) , who atone point simply must don a sequined miniskirt , sky-high heels and a magentawig in order to get the bad guy , because . . . well , she just has to.Roger <ORGANIZATION>Donaldson</ORGANIZATION> makes efficient hack work of a script adapted from a book byBill <PERSON>Granger</PERSON> . 
Stringing together every cliche , trope and cherished chestnut fromthe established canon of Thrillers 101 , <PERSON>Donaldson</PERSON> dutifully puts his charactersin their assigned places without flourish , fuss or inspiration . 
Words such as " ops " and " exfil " are tossed around like so many bread crumbs on a fish pond , the better to bring viewers to the surface so they can be whacked on the head bybrutish but mercifully quickly moving violence.Those moments are so predictable , and executed with such workmanliketediousness , that the action is actually pulse - slowing , which may beappropriate for a protagonist whose main motivation is simply to get back to aplacid retirement in <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> .
