<PERSON>Susan McGuire</PERSON> knows the exact moment when her college life will end.It wo n't be the last day of classes or exams , or the final performance of theShakespeare play she 's in , or the graduation ceremony itself . 
No . 
" The biggerthing is going to be when we strike the set , " she says , " and it 's no longer myspace . 
" It 's nothing much to look at , this space she 's talking about , just a bigsquarish room with the walls and ceiling painted black . 
But it 's been herpsychic home since she arrived at <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> <DATE>four years ago</DATE> , a tall , articulate , shy , strong-minded , sometimes awkward 17-year-old from <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> who 'd never beenon a date . 
Tucked into the back of a modest brick building on 37th Street NW , just across from the main campus , it is the headquarters of the Mask and <ORGANIZATION>BaubleDramatic Society</ORGANIZATION> , the independent theater club that <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> now runs . 
Last <DATE>spring</DATE> , she says , after she 'd been elected executive producer , and after the final showof the year had ended , " I just walked around in the space by myself . 
The spacewas completely empty , and it was mine . 
And that was such an incredible feeling . 
" This <DATE>spring</DATE> -- well , she does n't want to look too far ahead . 
The space is stillthe center of her world.Right now , " The Taming of the Shrew " is in rehearsal , and she 's playing thefemale lead . 
This <DATE>Friday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> in mid-March finds her straddling an armlessplastic chair , clutching a Sprite -- she 's given up <ORGANIZATION>Coke</ORGANIZATION> for Lent -- and tradingverbal jabs with <PERSON>Brian Soja</PERSON> , who plays Petruchio to her <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> , as they wait forthe action to begin . 
" What did we say yesterday ? 
It 's all about me , " she says . 
" No , it 's all about the taming of you , " he replies . 
" So it 's all about me . " 
" You 'd be nothing without me , " she snorts.A minute later , she holds out her hand and tugs <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> out of his chair . 
Theywalk out into the center of the space and he stands behind her , arms around herwaist , as the play 's director , <PERSON>Jason Yarn</PERSON> , issues his marching orders . 
" So let 's do four-one , " he says.That would be Act 4 , Scene 1 . 
It 's the scene in which <ORGANIZATION>Petruchio</ORGANIZATION> , the blusteringstranger to whom <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> has just been married against her will , attempts to " curbher mad and headstrong humor " by starving her and keeping her from sleeping . 
Sofar , at least , she remains unbowed . 
" Why sir , I trust I may have leave to speak , and speak I will , " she says angrilya couple of scenes into the rehearsal . 
" I am no child , no babe . 
" She 's still in character as <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> when she says this . 
But the real <PERSON>Susan McGuire</PERSON> -- were she to think back on the person she was when she came to <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> , andon the person she has since become -- could scarcely disagree . ' 
A <ORGANIZATION>Kind of Possession About Herself</ORGANIZATION> ' If there were such a thing as a typical member of the nation 's college class of2000 , it would most certainly not be <PERSON>Susan Frances McGuire</PERSON> , who , with roughly1 ,500 of her fellow Georgetown seniors , will put on a cap and gown this <DATE>weekend</DATE> , claim her diploma and step out from what she calls the " utopia " of herundergraduate life and into the so-called real world.For one thing , she 's far too accomplished to be typical . 
A dean 's list studentand one of 30 Georgetown juniors and seniors inducted this winter into <ORGANIZATION>AlphaSigma Nu</ORGANIZATION> , the Jesuit honor society , she is also an unusually talented singer andactress , with a stage presence so commanding that it can overpower those aroundher . 
" She 'll sweep out onstage and everyone just gives way , " <PERSON>Jason</PERSON> says . 
" We ' vehad to work on that . 
" Her leadership skills are " remarkable , " says Father <PERSON>Scott Pilarz</PERSON> , one of herEnglish professors and a former head of Mask and Bauble himself . 
" There 's not apompous or pretentious bone in her body . 
She 's very straightforward , honestabout what she thinks , and she 's got a kind of possession about herself that isuncommon among her classmates . " 
" She 's a doer , not a talker , " says <PERSON>Ted Parker</PERSON> , a university staffer who servesas a technical adviser to the school 's theater groups . 
In <DATE>September</DATE> , <LOCATION>Parkersays</LOCATION> , he told her that her club was in desperate need of a new <MONEY>$ 16,000</MONEY> lightingsystem . 
" Before I knew it , there it was . 
She found a way to get the money thatwas needed and just proceeded to do it . 
" Susan finds herself untypical as well . 
She 's much closer to her family , shethinks , than most of her friends , and more serious about her Catholicism ( sheprays every day , though she does n't flaunt her faith ) . 
She 's more intenselyinvolved with her longtime boyfriend , too . 
She does n't much like doing " hotspot " -- a warm-up exercise for actors in which you take turns leading the groupin song -- because what 's most likely to pop into her head is some BarbraStreisand number that nobody else knows or likes . 
She also understands that shehas an exceptionally forceful personality . 
" I 'm a big girl . 
I am very expressive with my body and I 'm very loud and I ' mvery blunt , " she says with a somewhat rueful laugh . 
" So I guess I should n't besurprised when people say that they 're intimidated by me . 
But I always am . 
" And yet , despite her indisputable individuality , it is also possible to view herlife as a representative one . 
For to enter the world of <PERSON>Susan McGuire</PERSON> -- fourcenturies after <PERSON>Shakespeare</PERSON> created his imperious <PERSON>Petruchio</PERSON> and his ultimatelysubservient <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> , eight decades after American women won the right toparticipate in American democracy , and 40 years after the introduction of thebirth control pill -- is to consider what it means to be young , gifted andfemale at the dawn of the 21st century.Susan 's world is one where there are virtually no restrictions on what a womancan do . 
She takes her equality with men as a given , and is surprised and annoyedif this equality is questioned , as it was once by a Georgetown administratorshortly after she was voted executive producer of Mask and Bauble . 
" He said , ' Now , how is it going to be with you being a female in the head position ? ' " 
sherecalls . 
" And I said , ' You know , I do n't think it 's going to make anydifference . ' " 
Then she reminded him that all four <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> theater groups areheaded by women this year.She says she would never let anyone talk about her the way the newly weddedPetruchio talks about <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> ( " She is my goods , my chattels ; she is my house , myhousehold stuff , my field , my barn , my horse , my ox , my ass , my anything " ) . 
Noway . 
" I would go and rip their head off if I had to . 
" But do n't get her wrong : She does n't identify this stance with feminism . 
" Iwould never call myself a feminist , " she says , and goes on to explain that whileshe greatly respects the historic struggle for women 's rights , the term nowimplies -- to her , at least -- an intolerant narrowness and an exclusion of menthat she finds abhorrent.This perspective is shared by many of her Georgetown peers , as even those who docall themselves feminists acknowledge . 
" Boy , that 's the big F-word here , " <PERSON>saysCarolyn Hurwitz</PERSON> , the university 's sexual assault and women 's health servicescoordinator , who came to know and admire <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> when they worked together on anorientation program for incoming freshmen . 
" When I came to campus and I toldsomebody I was a feminist , they were like kind of hushing me or something . 
" <PERSON>Hurwitz</PERSON> thinks today 's students see feminism " as a really radical kind of viewinstead of understanding it on any kind of basic level about equality . 
" Which <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> has no problem with , of course . 
Which none of her friends have aproblem with , and none of the people working on " The Taming of the Shrew " have aproblem with . 
In pursuit of basic equality , a number of the male roles in " Taming " have been cross-cast , with women playing men 's roles . 
Sure , thedirecting staff turned out to be all male -- " which they think is just a riot , " <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> says -- but no one has a problem with that either . 
There is , in fact , justone gender-roles issue that 's giving them serious grief : The play itself . 
" The Taming of the Shrew " was viewed by many as unacceptably sexist before theword " sexism " was invented . 
" The last scene is altogether disgusting to modernsensibility , " wrote <PERSON>George Bernard Shaw</PERSON> in <DATE>1897</DATE> . 
" No man with any decency offeeling can sit it out in the company of a woman without being extremely ashamedof the lord-of-creation moral implied in the wager and the speech put into thewoman 's own mouth . " 
<ORGANIZATION>Shaw</ORGANIZATION> is referring to the winning bet Petruchio makes with acouple of other new husbands about whose wife will prove the most obedient , andto <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> 's long closing monologue -- delivered at his command -- on a wife 's dutyto " serve , love and obey . 
" In the past , says <PERSON>Jason</PERSON> , the director , the play has been done basically one oftwo ways : " either the more classic way where <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> is tamed in the end , which isreally difficult to do these days , " or " the more modern way , in which <PERSON>Kate tamesPetruchio</PERSON> . " 
In this second version , <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> 's speech is viewed as a big joke on herhusband -- she 's not really tamed , as he 'll soon find out -- and she lets theaudience see this . 
In some productions , she goes so far as to grab his foot andliterally upend him , like a wrestler surprising a complacent opponent with atakedown move.Jason did n't like either of the standard versions . 
A thoughtful junior whodreams of directing films and who will take over from <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> next year as head ofMask and Bauble , he preferred a third option , " where in the end <PERSON>Kate andPetruchio</PERSON> are sort of equal , and they both wink out at the audience . " 
In thisscenario , both hate the hypocritical , money-mad society they 're stuck in , whichtreats marriage as a financial transaction , and each is looking for a way out.At first , <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> fails to see the potential for an emotional merger , so Petruchioweds her in what amounts to a hostile takeover . 
But by the end the two areco-conspirators , " playing the same game on everyone else . 
" The concept was n't wholly original -- <PERSON>Jason</PERSON> credits , among other influences , ananthology called The Woman 's Part : Feminist Criticism of Shakespeare -- but hehad n't seen the play done that way . 
He knew it would n't be easy . 
He thought he ' dfound some parts of the text that supported his interpretation . 
Still , therewas n't much for the actors to work with , and there were so many things -- theaudience 's expectations , the plot , the language itself -- that they would needto work against.Susan did n't care . 
" I wanted this part so much , " she says . 
" Kate just always seemed so much likeme . 
" By which she means . . . " Very strong . 
Very -- on the surface one way and underneath another . 
Not afraidto say anything . 
And that gets her in trouble a lot . " 
' Are You in College , or What ? ' 
" Woman ! 
Now ! 
Get up here ! " 
Brian yells . 
Susan slaps him . 
He pretends to fall tohis knees.It 's around 2 o'clock on a <DATE>Sunday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> , and they 're just starting to workon Act 5 . 
The actress who plays <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> 's simpering sister , <PERSON>Bianca</PERSON> , is drapedacross three plastic chairs with her eyes closed ; the stage manager gently wakesher up . 
Susan yawns as she waits for her entrance cue . 
Along with many in thecast , she was up late at a party <TIME>last night</TIME> . 
If you stayed past 1:30 , you got toplay a drinking game called <ORGANIZATION>Circle of Death</ORGANIZATION> . 
If you stayed later still , therewas a trip to the <ORGANIZATION>International House of Pancakes</ORGANIZATION> , after which you got to watchthe sun rise . 
It was <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> 's third sunrise this week . 
" Omigod , do n't shake me , " she says when <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> playfully grabs her shoulder.She gets through the first scene without incident . 
On to the wager , and to herfinal monologue , and to <ORGANIZATION>Petruchio</ORGANIZATION> 's immortal response ( " Why , there 's a wench!Come on and kiss me , Kate " ) . 
" You 've won ! " 
Jason tells <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> after he and Susanexit hand in hand . 
Then he amends this : " Both of you have won ! 
" Rehearsal is over for the day . 
An actor starts to fret about an economics exam . 
" Just pull an all-nighter , " <PERSON>Jason</PERSON> tells him . 
" Are you in college , or what ? 
" Well . . . yes.And is n't that the point ? 
" I see college as a sort of utopia , " <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> says a few days later , trying todescribe the charmed life she 's about to leave , " where you can try lots ofthings out in a very safe environment for the most part . " 
She understands thatit 's not safe all the time ; it would be hard for anyone to argue otherwiseduring a year in which vandals twice attacked a menorah on the <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> campusand a <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown</ORGANIZATION> student was killed in what appears to have been analcohol-fueled fight . 
Still , for her , college remains fundamentally " a city on ahill , protected from everything . 
" As a citizen of this temporary utopia , she says , she can behave in ways the realworld does n't allow . 
She can learn whatever she wants to learn , she does n't haveto worry about paying bills and she can do as little or as much work as shepleases . 
She mostly chooses to work hard , because she thinks you get more out ofschool that way , " but that 's something that needs to be learned . . . not a rulethat should just be blindly obeyed . 
" More important is the fact that in college , " all your friends are right there . 
" Any night of the week , she can find someone to hang out with . 
" We can go out andhave a good time , whether we 're drinking or not drinking . 
I can stay up until 5o ' clock in the <TIME>morning</TIME> , like I did <TIME>last night</TIME> , talking to three of my friends . 
Ican make new friends who are my own age all the time , because they 're all aroundme . 
" Asked which classmates she 'll stay close to after she graduates , she reels off16 names without hesitation ( they 're evenly split : eight women , eight men ) . 
Herwalks across campus are punctuated by affectionate greetings -- " Hi , babe ! " 
" Hi , sweetie ! " 
( the language does n't vary , never mind the gender of the friend ) . 
Athome in the on-campus rooftop apartment she shares with two of her closestfriends , she can count on a stream of drop-in visitors . 
After a Wednesdayevening rehearsal , if she does n't have theater work or schoolwork to catch upon , she 's likely to head over to the Tombs , a student-dominated eating anddrinking establishment a stone 's throw from campus , where <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> is '80s Night . 
She 'll join half a dozen of her friends there , share <MONEY>$ 6</MONEY> pitchers ofMiller , talk about anything and everything . 
They 'll interrupt the conversationto chorus along with <PERSON>Bryan Adams</PERSON> on " Summer of <DATE>' 69</DATE> " : And if I had the choice -- Yeah , I 'd always want to be there.Those were the best days of my life . . . Most of <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> 's friends are Mask and Bauble people , which is hardly surprising.The club offers instant community for anyone passionate about theater . 
But M&B has been part of <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> 's undergraduate utopia in a more surprising way as well.Because it requires the exercise of genuine responsibility , it has provided thekind of real-world experience -- both artistic and entrepreneurial -- that thereal world itself may deny her for years.With no theater department to oversee them , <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown</ORGANIZATION> 's student-run troupeshave more independence than those at other schools . 
The university 's Office ofPerforming Arts contributes <MONEY>$ 7,000</MONEY> or so to <ORGANIZATION>M&B</ORGANIZATION> 's roughly <MONEY>$ 30,000</MONEY> budget , andtwo part-timers who work for <ORGANIZATION>OPA</ORGANIZATION> offer significant technical and artisticadvice . 
But the fact remains that the club produces five shows a year largely onits own.Susan has made a second home of the M&B office , a small , cramped room downstairsfrom the space that holds a couple of desks , a battered couch , a computer andprinter , and a bookshelf filled with decaying scrapbooks from old productions.The mottled gray carpeting looks like it has n't been vacuumed in months . 
Aboveone desk hangs a snapshot-covered bulletin board . 
It 's not quiteall-Susan-all-the-time , but it 's close : Here she is in " Assassins " ( " my secondshow at Georgetown " ) and " The Heidi Chronicles " ( " I played a foul-mouthedlesbian " ) and " Tommy " ( " my least favorite show ever " ) and " The Fantasticks " ( " <PERSON>Alison</PERSON> and I are roommates because of that show " ) . 
In all , she 's acted in 13shows in four years.In the office , however , she trades her actor 's hat for her manager 's hat . 
Sheoften spends three or four hours there after a weeknight rehearsal ends at 11 . 
In addition to the normal responsibilities of an M&B executive producer -- overseeing the budget , running board meetings and generally managing theorganization -- she has had to spend far more time than her predecessors dealingwith the university administration . 
The good news is , there 's been a <MONEY>$ 5 milliondonation</MONEY> toward a new arts center , and the donor has apparently specified Maskand Bauble involvement in its use . 
The bad news is that different constituencieshave different ideas about who should control it , and this apparent boon toGeorgetown theater could end up undermining M&B . 
It 's a complicated politicalequation , and <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> has devoted more energy to it than she would have liked.Meanwhile , she is still in college . 
Which means she does still have classes , even if she 's picked a low-stress schedule this semester . 
She piled up enoughcredits to graduate , as an English literature major , long ago.She 's taking her first art class ever , printmaking , which offers an opportunityfor schmoozing and sharing career anxieties . 
" Any hope , <PERSON>Lize</PERSON> ? " 
she asks apre-med friend one day . 
" Wait-listed at <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> , " comes the reply . 
Her ownapplications to three highly competitive master of fine arts programs -- atDePaul , <ORGANIZATION>NYU</ORGANIZATION> and Yale -- are still pending , and she 's not sure precisely whatshe 'll do if she does n't get in.She 's taking an acting class that she helped talk one of her favorite teachers -- veteran local actress <PERSON>Sarah Marshall</PERSON> -- into offering.She 's taking Poetry and Religion in <LOCATION>Early Modern England</LOCATION> with Father Pilarz , whoone day turns the discussion to <PERSON>John Donne</PERSON> 's Holy Sonnet 7 . 
The Holy Sonnets area " strange combination of arrogance and vulnerability , " <PERSON>Pilarz</PERSON> says , and thisparticular poem is " incredibly dramatic . " 
Susan 's hand goes up . 
" But the theatricality of it completely goes with the vulnerability , " she says , " because that 's why people are theatrical : to mask themselves against thatvulnerability . 
" Finally , she 's taking a children 's literature class , where one day the assignedreading is <PERSON>Madeleine L'Engle</PERSON> 's A Wrinkle in <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> . 
This was one of Susan ' schildhood favorites -- she loved the physics-like explanation of how you crossthe boundaries between different worlds , and she was proud that she understoodthe big words . 
So when her professor , <PERSON>Leona Fisher</PERSON> , makes fun of some ofL ' <ORGANIZATION>Engle</ORGANIZATION> 's awkward prose , she rises to the book 's defense . 
" When I was 9 and I read this , " she says , " I remember how smart I felt I was . 
. 
. " 
" All right , that 's going to be our transition , " <PERSON>Fisher</PERSON> says . 
" Who 's the audiencefor this book -- specific audience , not just 9-year-olds ? 
. . . Keep Susan inmind as you answer . 
" Perhaps it 's children who feel like outsiders , someone suggests , and Fisheragrees : " It 's the 150-IQ kid who has never had a friend . " 
She turns quickly toSusan : " That 's not personal ! " 
" It 's true ! " 
Susan says . 
" It 's true ! " 
' What 's Going On , Is Something Wrong ? 
' On <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> 's bedroom wall , across from the show posters and the Mask and Bauble " Guess Who 's REALLY in Charge " award and above the shelf where she keeps thefire-breathing wind-up nun and the pearl necklace her boyfriend gave her forChristmas one year , there is a framed photograph of three little girls sittingon a stone wall . 
Their backs are to the photographer -- they 're looking out atthe ocean , <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> thinks -- and it 's not really a picture of anyone she knows , " but we call it ' My Two Sisters and I , ' and I 'm the little one on the left thatthe dress is too big and the hair 's all messy , and <ORGANIZATION>Hillary</ORGANIZATION> 's the one in themiddle , the biggest one , embracing both sisters , and <PERSON>Katie</PERSON> 's the one on theright with , like , the curly hair . 
" She was born on <DATE>December 5 , 1978</DATE> , the youngest of four children in a warm andexceptionally close family ( her brother , <PERSON>Christopher</PERSON> , is the oldest ) in theChicago suburb of <LOCATION>Park Ridge</LOCATION> . 
Her sisters soon took to calling her " Midget Mama " because she behaved so much like a miniature adult . 
" She was just a very mature , real heady , real smart kid , " says her mother , <PERSON>Lynn McGuire</PERSON> . 
" She spoke very wellfrom a very young age , and she 'd be the one to say , ' You should n't do that ! ' 
" Her father , <PERSON>Tony</PERSON> , was a mechanical engineer who would soon start his owncompany . 
Lynn , who 'd been an editor at Institutional Investor when she met herhusband , went back to work -- as an office manager -- when <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> was 3 . 
Thefamily needed the cash.In kindergarten , <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> 's favorite thing was the Letter People , a set ofthree-foot blow-up alphabet dolls in which " all the vowels were women and allthe consonants were men . " 
She did n't think about the fact that the guy dollsoutnumbered the girl dolls , though she did think it was sort of cool that thevowels were female , " because you have to have a vowel to make a word . " 
Shestarted reading before she got to first grade and read voraciously -- as herfamily invariably describes it -- throughout her childhood . 
Social interactionswere not her first priority ; sometimes she 'd be playing with a group of kids , get bored , and wander off to find a book . 
But she was a cheerful,self-sufficient child , and she especially loved going to school.Until , one year , she did n't love it anymore.The problems began in third grade and got much worse in fourth . 
" What 's goingon , is something wrong ? " 
Lynn would ask when her daughter trudged through thedoor in the <TIME>afternoon</TIME> , but <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> would n't tell her . 
" She 'd come in andimmediately go upstairs , no conversation . 
I mean , I knew this kid who had beenhopping home from school laughing and talking . 
Her personality just changed . 
. 
. 
and every couple of weeks we 'd realize it was a little worse . 
" It turned out that <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> was the girl her female classmates had decided toostracize . 
( The boys were never a problem . ) 
No one knows why , but the reasonsare n't hard to imagine . 
She was the smartest kid in the class , and did n't try tohide it . 
She was the biggest girl , and physically a little awkward . 
She alwaysspoke her mind , and did n't know that bluntness can inspire resentment -- or thatchildren , especially in packs , can be ferociously intolerant and mean.The worst was when she showed up at a girl 's front door for a party that wasalready over . 
She 'd been out sick when the invitations were distributed , andsomeone had whited out the time on hers and written in a false one . 
Lynn hadbeen trying to stay low-key about the situation , figuring it would only hurt herdaughter if she made a scene , but now she marched into the principal 's officescreaming mad . 
" I said , ' I have known things to happen , I 've known mean things , but this -- ' " I think it changes kids for life . 
I really do . 
" The rest of fourth grade was a blur . 
Susan remained stoic in class , her mothersays , but at home she " cried all the way through the <TIME>night</TIME> , cried in my lap withevery piece of her body because she was devastated and humiliated and hurt . " 
Atthe end of the year , the McGuires moved from the suburbs into <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> . 
They ' dbeen planning to do this anyway , but they looked forward to giving <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> a newstart.Fast-forward a couple of years . 
Susan has skipped fifth grade and done fine insixth . 
Sometime in seventh grade , her father recalls , " she kind of casuallymentioned to us , ' Well , I 'm in a play at school . ' 
" The McGuires trooped off to see it , though <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> " never told us anything aboutthe play , never told us what role she had . " 
Turned out it was a musical called " Magellan . " 
Tony <PERSON>McGuire</PERSON> sat and watched as " all these kids come out and they ' redoing this choral-type thing , and all of a sudden this kid comes up to centerstage and knocked the audience off their feet . " 
Nine years later , he rubs hiseyes as he remembers the first time he saw his daughter sing onstage . 
" I said , ' Who the hell is this ? 
It 's not my kid ! ' " ' 
I Need to Do This for Myself ' " You guys walk away if I turn my back to you ! 
Everyone here has attentiondeficit disorder ! 
" The " Taming " cast is being bad , and <PERSON>Jason</PERSON> is yelling at them . 
It 's a week and ahalf before the show goes up , and today they 're supposed to run through the playwith minimal interruptions . 
But now the rehearsal 's at a standstill andPetruchio and <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> are in a slow-dance clinch , with Petruchio making strangegrunting noises , and one of the suitors is throwing <PERSON>Bianca</PERSON> over his shoulder asthe rest of the actors clap and stomp.Half an hour later , they 're up to Act 2 , Scene 1 . 
Petruchio has just introducedhimself to <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> , and they 're in the midst of the tense and funny exchange ofpuns through which they take each other 's measure . 
The scene is crucial inestablishing that they 're evenly matched , and thus capable of forging an equalpartnership . 
Susan wants to tone down the excessive shrewishness she thinks mostpeople are expecting . 
Her <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> is angry , and with good reason -- her father istrying to sell her , after all -- but there 's much more going on than that . 
" There 's such an emotional roller coaster in the whole scene , " she says . 
Atvarious times she must be not only angry but also " sort of nonchalant , laughing , and starting to see that this may be someone who I might be interested in . 
" That incipient interest shows most clearly near the end , when Petruchio praisesher beauty so convincingly that she drops the book she 's carrying -- <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> plansto use her copy of A Room of One 's Own . 
But then he sees her father approach andinstantly reverts to macho posturing . 
" For I am he am born to tame you , <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> , " he cries , and before she knows what 's hit her , he 's announcing that <DATE>Sunday</DATE> willbe their wedding day . 
" I 'll see thee hanged on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> first , " she says , with a glare that would curdleBudweiser.Nose to nose , they seem an even match . 
At 5-9 3/4 , <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> looks taller than <PERSON>Brianwhen</PERSON> her hair is up ; when it 's down , or when her heels are low , he may have halfan inch on her . 
This equality in stature is a recent development , however . 
Whenrehearsals began , <PERSON>Jason</PERSON> and his stage manager , <PERSON>Mike Boyle</PERSON> , noticed that Susanseemed to tower over <LOCATION>Brian</LOCATION> . 
This would n't do ; their <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> was a bit too much of apowerhouse already , compared with their mild-mannered , sweet-faced Petruchio , and they could n't afford to have him just blown away . 
So they taped two-by-foursto his back -- " I was crucified , basically , " <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> says -- until he learned tostand up straight.It 's <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> 's first year at <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> , and he 's a little in awe of <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> . 
Thegap between freshman and senior can be huge , he says , though she 's doneeverything she can to bridge it , and he 's grateful.In truth , it can either be huge or -- not so huge . 
Sometimes it 's both at once.As the story of <PERSON>Susan McGuire</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jack Shay</PERSON> proves.Susan had been on campus all of three days when she first laid eyes on herfuture partner in what she describes as " matched , mutual love . " 
She and herfreshman roommate went to the Mask and Bauble orientation show , and there , up onstage , she saw " this five-foot-nine stocky long-blond-haired goateed person " whowould pop out every now and then to spit out a one-word joke derived from hischaracter 's name , Mr. <PERSON>Fuchs</PERSON> . 
" And I , like , grabbed my roommate 's hand and said , ' Oh , I think he is so cute ! ' 
And she sort of looked at me like , ' Omigod , we justmet -- what are you telling me ? ' 
" In <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> 's <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> apartment , protected by a clear plastic envelope -- " It willbe bound one day , I 'm sure , " he says -- there is a detailed record of whathappened next . 
It 's called " Travels with <PERSON>Jack Shay</PERSON> : A Journal Made With Love onMay 4 , <DATE>1997</DATE> " ; <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> gave it to him for his <DATE>22nd birthday</DATE> , and it charts theearly stages of their romance . 
A section labeled " The Prehistory " makes note ofthe Mr. <PERSON>Fuchs</PERSON> encounter , plus every single time she laid eyes on him before theday , a month and <DATE>a half later</DATE> , they finally were introduced.This was not what she 'd had in mind when she graduated from <ORGANIZATION>St. Ignatius CollegePrep</ORGANIZATION> and headed off to <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> . 
Eighth grade had been rough ; she 'd gonethrough a painful reprise of her fourth-grade social problems . 
She 'd survivedthat , however , and had a wonderful time in high school , complete with academicsuccess , singing and acting triumphs , profoundly rewarding religious retreatsand close friendships with both guys and girls.There had been no boyfriends , though . 
And while she felt a little left out , itwas n't like she was planning to rush things . 
She fully expected to get marriedeventually , but she expected to have a career in place first , " and I was n'tgoing to meet the person I married in college , I did n't think . 
" As for Jack : He was starting his senior year , he 'd had plenty of girlfriends , hedid n't know what he wanted to do with his life , but he had made one firmdecision : " I had promised myself that freshmen were out of bounds . 
" Never mind.By <DATE>November</DATE> , they were officially a couple -- a major milestone in theprevailing <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> social system , where casual " hook-ups " are more commonthan formal dates . 
By <DATE>December</DATE> , <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> was surprising her with that pearlnecklace . 
Over the next two years , during which time he graduated but stayed intown and worked as a copy aide at <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> , they were always eachother 's number one priority.In the fall of her junior year , however , <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> started to feel that she wasmissing out on something . 
Her college experience had been totally shaped by theromance , and she felt herself too rigidly cast in the role of <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> 's Girlfriend.She wanted to be closer to her other friends , but could n't , because theiremotional lives and schedules were so different . 
She started to think she neededto date other people , to go through some of the normal college experiences thatJack himself had been through . 
She asked herself , " What 's going to happen whenI 'm 30 and I 'm thinking , ' Omigod , there 's never been anybody else in my life ' ? 
" The breakup was " horrible -- horrible . " 
At one point , she tried to tell him thatshe did n't love him , " but I had to take it back , because I knew it was n't true . 
" All she could say was , " I need to do this for myself , because I know that I needto do this . 
" <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> was heartbroken and furious -- but he had another reaction , too . 
One of hisfirst thoughts , as he walked out of her house that <DATE>January</DATE> day , was , " I ca n'tbelieve she did it . 
Whatever I think of the decision . . . it was something thatshe was able to do it . 
" She then crammed a whole college career into 11 months.She spent much more time with her friends , as planned -- especially herroommates , <PERSON>Liz Pentecost</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alison Habiger</PERSON> -- mostly just going out and havingfun . 
( " Those girls know more about me than I know about myself " is how Alisondescribes their closeness now . ) 
She made new friends , too , who 'd never known heras anybody 's girlfriend.But more important : She was able to be sure that the things she was achieving , she was achieving by herself . 
" While we were still dating , " she explains , " sometimes I felt like things I did , I achieved because of him , or I could because of him . 
And now I was out on myown , and -- I 'm more proud of these accomplishments . " 
She became executiveproducer of Mask and Bauble , which proved how much her peers respected her . 
Sheacted in both musicals and straight plays , the latter being something that shehad n't tried before . 
She did well in school.Somewhat to her surprise , she never really dated anyone . 
" There were a fewpeople that I hooked up with , " she says , " but no one could be <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> , " and shehad , it turned out , no interest in going any further with any of them . 
Still , she was satisfied that she 'd experienced " the single life at <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> , " or atleast enough of it to know that " I 'm okay not experiencing it anymore . 
" <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> , meanwhile , had acquired a new girlfriend , and he 'd found a new job in anew city -- her hometown . 
They 'd barely spoken since they 'd broken up , but theymanaged a cup of coffee in <DATE>October</DATE> just before he moved . 
By the time she saw himagain , when she went home for Thanksgiving , she could n't hold back her feelingsany longer . 
" I said to him , ' I 'm still in love with you , and I ca n't not tell you . ' 
. . . Iwas opening up like I never had before . 
He said , ' I 've never seen you thisvulnerable , ever . ' 
And I was like , ' Welcome to the new me . ' " ' 
I Know I 'm a Foul Contending Rebel ' Welcome to the new <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> , Petruchio is saying.Well , not quite in those words -- but that 's the gist of it . 
They 're runningthrough the final scene once more , five days before the dress rehearsal.Petruchio has won his bet and his newly " tamed " wife has just reappearedonstage , dragging with her the other two new wives -- her sister and a certainrich widow -- who have failed to respond when summoned . 
She 's got <LOCATION>Bianca</LOCATION> in apainful-looking headlock . 
" See where she comes and brings your froward wives , " is what Petruchio actuallysays . 
Then : " <PERSON>Katherine</PERSON> , I charge thee , tell these headstrong women what dutythey do owe their lords and husbands . 
" Cue the monologue . 
" Fie , fie , " <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> begins , striding toward the infuriated widow , " unknit thatthreatening unkind brow and dart not scornful glances from those eyes to woundthy lord , thy king , thy governor . . . " And she 's off , launched into one of themost famous speeches in <LOCATION>Shakespeare</LOCATION> , the one <PERSON>Bernard Shaw</PERSON> said no right-mindedmodern can sit through without squirming.She 's still having trouble with it.Susan knows her lines , knows how to move onstage , knows when to " break thefourth wall " and address the audience directly . 
But it 's hard to fight throughShakespeare 's language to reveal who this <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> really is . 
The monologue " is notwritten to be said the way we 're saying it , " she explains . 
In their version , with <ORGANIZATION>Petruchio</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> now willing partners in a private game , " Kate does n'tbuy into what she says in the end , and it 's all said with irony and sarcasm . 
" So when this <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> says that a wife who flouts her husband 's will is nothing but " a foul contending rebel , " she must somehow convey , through tone and expressionand body language , that " I know I 'm a foul contending rebel " and " I do n't thinkthere 's anything wrong with that . 
" When she asserts that women " are bound to serve , love and obey , " she does n'tmean it . 
" Love , yes . 
Serve and obey , no . 
Throw it out the window . 
You need apartnership . 
You need to find someone who thinks the same way you do . 
" And when she says , " I am ashamed that women are so simple " -- whoa ! 
She reallydoes n't mean it . 
That last word , in the Shakespearean sense , means " silly , " butto <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> 's <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> it means " non-complex " as well . 
" Women are complex , " sheinsists . 
" Women are bitchy . 
Women are control-oriented . 
Women are wonderful.Women are powerful . 
They 're anything but simple . 
" It 's an inarguable point . 
Certainly no one who knows the real <PERSON>Susan McGuirewould</PERSON> ever dispute it . 
Her choices and her views do n't fit any pre-shaped mold.Here is <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> , for instance , who would never call herself a feminist , on thecommodification of women : " I think the selling no longer has anything to do withmarriage necessarily , but it has to do with why magazines with hourglass-bodiedwomen on the cover sell so many ads . 
Why do plastic surgeons reconfiguringpeople 's bodies buy so many ads ? 
Why do makeup companies sell so much makeup ? 
. 
. 
. 
These are all marketing ploys and massive , massive money enterprises , allfocused on selling the female image that they have picked out to be the ideal . 
" Here she is on the related subject of male obtuseness : " One of my friends inparticular , whom I will not name , wants to date somebody so much , right ? 
Andthere are people who have liked him , but they do n't fit into his little , like , Hoya girl , cute body , sort of dumb image that he thinks he wants . 
He thinksthat 's what he wants , and yet he just goes off all the time about how thesegirls are n't good in class and they are n't smart and they do n't know how tospeak for themselves and da-da-da-da-da . 
" And here she is on the subject of <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> edicts and her school 's policy onbirth control : " I do not believe in what the pope says . . . It seems totallyridiculous to me : People are dying because they have unprotected sex , and westill can not get birth control on our campus in any form ! 
" To suggest an overlap with feminist ideas would be only to state the obvious.But to leave it at that would be both unfair and , well -- Too simple . 
" Some people live their lives and everything they talk about falls into an ' ism , ' " <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> says angrily one afternoon , tired of trying to make herself clearon this point . 
She 's sprawled on the futon in her living room , chin in hand , andshe 's doing her best not to scream . 
" I just do n't think that way . 
It 's not theway my mind works . 
My mind works : What makes me happy ? 
What can I do for myself?What can I give back to those people who have given to me ? 
And frankly , I justdo n't think in terms of male and female right now . . . Look at my friends ! 
It ' snot a male thing or a female thing . 
There 's no sense of not being equal betweenus ! 
" Older people ca n't seem to get it through their heads , she says , that she andher generation have a vastly different perspective on men 's and women 's roles . 
" Because as much as we have heard about the way things were , it 's still historyto us . 
It 's still past . 
We have not experienced it to any large extent . 
" She 's not blind . 
She knows there 's still inequality out there . 
" And I know I ' mgoing to experience it , and I know it 's going to completely piss me off . 
Butthat 's something that I do n't even want to think about dealing with quite yet.Because we do have equal relationships in my little utopian world right now -- and I 'm trying to hold on to that as much as I can . 
" So forget the labels and the isms -- please . 
" I just want to be my own person ! 
" Who is she , then , this independent , stubborn , caring , ambitious , talented , vulnerable yet seemingly unstoppable woman of the new century ? 
Or perhaps moreto the point : Who will she be when she hits the non-utopian world and finds outhow much it either has or has n't changed since previous generations matriculatedthere?It 's a rhetorical question at this point ; the real answer wo n't come for 10 or20 years . 
But perhaps a tentative one is suggested by the following story.A year ago <DATE>last fall</DATE> , <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> took part in a series of skits on alcohol abuse , racism , sexual assault and other hazards of campus life . 
The skits are presentedeach year as part of <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> 's freshman orientation program . 
One of her roleswas as the injured party in a date-rape scenario . 
Perfectionist that she is , shetook her preparation seriously , spending time with <PERSON>Carolyn Hurwitz</PERSON> , the sexualassault coordinator , as well as incorporating what she had learned about rapeand its emotional consequences from someone she knew who had been through it.The program was held in <PERSON>Gaston Hall</PERSON> , a formal , stained-glass-and-dark-woodGeorgetown auditorium . 
In it were packed some 700 restless freshmen who 'd justsaid goodbye to their parents , who 'd already been doing some partying , and who , in short , did not particularly want to be there . 
The skit called for <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> andthe young man playing her attacker to alternate monologues , giving theirseparate versions of the event . 
When they got to the part where <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> explainedthat his feeling around above her waist had been fine with her , she just had n'twanted things to go any further , the audience -- led by a group of male athletesin the balcony -- went crazy . 
" They were screaming and hooting and hollering and laughing , " <PERSON>Hurwitz</PERSON> says . 
" Butshe just stayed in character , and she got this higher level of intensity andlooked at them and said , ' You do n't understand what it 's like . ' 
. . . A lot ofother people in that moment would have lost the scene and it would have beenover . " 
" I was so offended that they would even laugh , " <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> says . 
" I stopped and Ilooked up in the balcony and I said , ' What , do you think that 's funny ? 
Do youthink it 's really funny ? 
Well , listen to what happened ! ' 
" She said it " right to them , " says <PERSON>Karen Berman</PERSON> , who 's an artistic adviser forthe <PERSON>Georgetown</PERSON> theater groups , " and they shut up . " 
It was a stunningperformance , something even a much more seasoned actress might have had troublepulling off.Still , it did n't stop one of the guys in the balcony from calling <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> themodern equivalent of " a cursed shrew " as he passed her on his way out . 
' It 's Like a Movie Is Playing in My Mind ' Perhaps utopia is not the word for this.Perhaps it would be more precise to think of college as a kind of extendedrehearsal time . 
A time to test how firmly your persona has been shaped , how longyou can stay in character with a live audience hooting and hollering out there.And in <LOCATION>Susan</LOCATION> 's case , a time to see how the different parts of your characterhave balanced out . 
" People say to me , ' Oh I was so intimidated when I first met you , ' " she says . 
" I still think of myself as this very small little girl -- and I 'm just not ! 
-- who did n't have any friends in fourth grade . 
" One more rehearsal , then , before graduation time.It 's a little before <TIME>7 p.m.</TIME> , just over an hour before the curtain . 
Susan archesher eyebrows in front of a mirror in Mask and Bauble 's basement makeup room , acontainer of baby wipes and a <PERSON>Ben Nye</PERSON> theatrical makeup kit at the ready . 
Ghostsof old performances hang from the costume rack above her head . 
With half a dozenother members of the " Taming " cast , she sings sporadically along as a boom boxlays down a soundtrack from generations past : <ORGANIZATION>Fleetwood Mac</ORGANIZATION> , the RighteousBrothers -- oops , no , that 's a <ORGANIZATION>Hall & Oates</ORGANIZATION> cover -- and <PERSON>Cher</PERSON> 's tarted-upversion of <PERSON>Betty Everett</PERSON> 's " The Shoop Shoop Song " : Is it in his eyes?Oh no , you 'll be deceivedIs it in his sighsOh no , he 'll make-believeIf you want to know if he loves you soIt 's in his kiss.Actually , tonight , it 's in her kiss -- at least as far as <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> and Petruchio areconcerned . 
Not the megasmooch at the play 's end , the one that sometimes causesthe rest of the cast to break out in the Big Red chewing gum jingle ( " So kiss -- a little longer , hold tight -- a little longer " ) during rehearsals . 
The realacting challenge , for <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brian</PERSON> , comes with a more subtle kiss in theprevious scene , the kiss that first lets Petruchio know Kate truly cares forhim . 
Tonight 's the dress rehearsal , but they 're still fine-tuning it . 
Betweennow and opening night , they 'll change it once again.They 'll change a few other things as well , including the costume Petruchio wearsin the wedding scene ( he 'll charge out , to hilarious effect , in a Supermanshirt ) and the book <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> is reading when she meets him ( <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> could n't find ARoom of One 's Own , so she 's borrowed a copy of The Princessa : <ORGANIZATION>Machiavelli</ORGANIZATION> forWomen instead ) . 
Opening night will go off well , and afterward they 'll toast eachother at a party where <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> will look around the room and say , " I feel reallyold , " and they 'll do five more shows and strike the set and the space will beJason 's , not hers.She 'll spend the next few weeks crying with her friends , collecting a batch oftheater honors , and answering questions about what happened with the fine artsprograms -- she did n't get in -- and what she 's going to do . 
She knows she ' sgoing home for the <DATE>summer</DATE> , where she 'll be a maid of honor in her sister ' swedding , and in the fall she 'll get some kind of job while she figures out hernext move . 
In moments of frustration , she sometimes thinks she should just getan engineering degree and take over her dad 's company , but she does n't reallywant to be an engineer . 
Meanwhile , she and <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> will get used to being in thesame city again . 
They got back together -- for good , they both believe -- inDecember , and they use the M-word openly these days . 
No one expects it to happensoon , however , so they 'll have plenty of time to argue the <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> as Stay-at-HomeMom question.He ca n't picture it . 
She can.But right now , before the dress rehearsal , as she sits before the mirror dabbingmakeup above her eyes , she 's thinking only as far ahead as Act 5 , Scene 2 . 
Herstomach hurts . 
Her mouth is dry . 
Her heart pounds so hard and fast that she canfeel it.She gets up and puts on the deep magenta satin knee-length dress she 'll wear inher first scene . 
The cast gathers for warm-ups in the parking lot behind thebuilding . 
They stretch and do tongue twisters ( " I am a mother pheasant plucker ; I pluck mother pheasants " ) . 
They sing " Brown-Eyed Girl " and " Margaritaville " ( " Some people claim / that there 's a woman to blame / And I know / it 's my owndamn fault " ) . 
They finish up with a wild rendition of the school fight song andhead inside . 
Except that a few minutes later , <PERSON>Susan</PERSON> reemerges to stand and singalone -- almost inaudibly now -- in the <LOCATION>Georgetown</LOCATION> dusk.All this time , there 's been a kind of private warm-up going on inside her . 
" It ' slike a movie is playing in my mind of our rehearsals , " she says , " and I canwatch the whole play in my head . " 
She runs through all her lines , over and over.But she also conjures up those moments when -- between the lines , or in spite ofthe lines -- she must evoke the bond Petruchio and <PERSON>Kate</PERSON> have forged , andhighlight the hidden equality of their connection . 
And every time she gets tothe end of the movie in her mind , she comes up against that closing monologue.Which , against all odds and isms , she must somehow persuade the audience to hearthe way she wants it heard.She is no child , no babe . 
She knows this will be hard . 
" It would be easy if I could just be tamed , " she says.Bob <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> is a staff writer for the Magazine . 
He will be fielding questionsand comments about this article <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> at <TIME>1 p.m.</TIME> at www.washingtonpost.com/liveonline .
