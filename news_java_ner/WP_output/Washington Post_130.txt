Anthony " Carlos Danger " <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON> has so far resisted calls from his former <LOCATION>NewYork</LOCATION> congressional colleagues to drop out of the race and get some " serious " help for his sexting habits.Polls had shown the Democrat in the lead in the crowded field for thefirst-round vote on <DATE>Sept. 10</DATE> but losing in an <DATE>Oct. 1</DATE> runoff.The late-night comics , led by <PERSON>Jay Leno</PERSON> , desperately pleaded for him to hang inthere . 
" I 'm pleading with the voters of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> , " <PERSON>Leno</PERSON> said , " please elect thisman , please . " 
( Probably not going to happen , but it would be nice if he hung in there untilSeptember , to help get us through traditionally slow <DATE>August</DATE> . ) 
Meanwhile , on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> , a congressman-turned-mayor , <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> 's <PERSON>Bob Filner</PERSON> ( D ) , is also resisting calls for him to step down , amid allegations that hesexually harassed several women.Things got worse this week when his former communications director filed aharassment suit.The <ORGANIZATION>City Council</ORGANIZATION> president suggested that employees be given " alternativeworkspace " away from <PERSON>Filner</PERSON> 's office " to ensure a safe work environment andmaintain productivity . 
" <PERSON>Filner</PERSON> also apologized and promised to change his ways.We had assumed <PERSON>Filner</PERSON> was surely a goner any day now . 
But then , just as a thirdwoman came forward <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> with more allegations against him , we got a " You ' reInvited ! 
Save the Date " e-mail from him asking us to join him <DATE>Sept. 28</DATE> at the " Grand Opening Ceremony " of the new <LOCATION>San Diego</LOCATION> Central Library.We tentatively penciled in the event.A George boom?The royal couple picked the name <PERSON>George Alexander Louis</PERSON> for their new baby . 
It ' sdistinguished , for sure , and quite British ( see the various King Georges andGeorge <PERSON>Harrison</PERSON> ) . 
Some political trivia : Although we 've had a good run of presidents named <PERSON>George</PERSON> ( <LOCATION>George Washington</LOCATION> , and then those two <PERSON>George Bushes</PERSON> ) , it 's not the most popularpresidential name . 
That would be <PERSON>James</PERSON> ( six of 'em ) , followed by <PERSON>John andWilliam</PERSON> at four each.But <PERSON>George</PERSON> is n't so common among the current political set.Congress has only two <PERSON>Georges</PERSON> , both in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> : Reps. <PERSON>George Miller</PERSON> ( D-Calif . ) 
andGeorge Holding ( R-N.C . ) 
. 
Not a one in the Senate.There are no Georges to be found in the Cabinet , either.Though if , as expected , the royal baby name sets off a global trend , we canexpect a <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> full of Georges starting in about . . . <DATE>2070</DATE> ( since theaverage age of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> is 57 ) . 
The Vote for Me ActBill titles , with their often loaded and coded language , have become marketingtools for lawmakers looking to sell their policies to their colleagues andconstituents.From clever acronyms to carefully chosen buzzwords , the names of pieces oflegislation are rarely afterthoughts.The <LOCATION>Loop</LOCATION> sorted through some of the immigration and other bills floating aroundCongress , and helpfully translated them.S . 
1348 ( of the <ORGANIZATION>110th Congress</ORGANIZATION> ) : The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of2007.Translation : Here 's our latest attempt at a really , really big bill that fixesimmigration . 
( Snooze - that was so 2007 . ) 
S. 1 : The Immigration Reform that Works for <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's Future Act . 
( This is theSenate Democrats ' signature bill . ) 
Translation : " Works " - that 's a double entendre - means it creates jobs . 
And " <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's Future " has a grand sort of scope to it , so you know it 's good.S . 
744 : The <ORGANIZATION>Border Security</ORGANIZATION> , Economic Opportunity , and Immigration ModernizationAct.Translation : There 's something in here for everyone ! 
Sealing up the borders?Yup . 
Creating jobs ? 
Done . 
Also , it 's not that scary , liberal " reform , " it 's just " modernization " ( i.e. , the current system is outdated ) . 
H.R. 2131 : The Supplying Knowledge Based Immigrants and Lifting Levels of STEMVisas Act.Translation : We can let the smart ones in.H.R . 
2278 : The Strengthen and Fortify Enforcement Act.Translation : Who does n't like their enforcement nice and beefy?And a few non-immigration bills with titles that caught our eye : H.R. 23 : The Sanctity of Human Life Act.Translation : Vote against this one , and you might as well vote for theAnti-American Pie Act.H.R . 
2643 : The Stay in Place , Cut the Waste Act of <DATE>2013</DATE> . 
Translation : Keeping federal workers right where they are instead ofgallivanting off to far flung conferences = saving money.S . 
1192 and <LOCATION>H.R.</LOCATION> 2444 : The Commonsense Contractor Compensation Act of <DATE>2013</DATE> . 
Translation : What , you do n't like a little common sense with your reforms?Those darn scribesAs the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Vietnamese media were leaving the <ORGANIZATION>Oval Office</ORGANIZATION> on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> aftera brief photo op , one of the television cameras still rolling caught PresidentObama quipping to <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> 's president , <ORGANIZATION>Truong Tan Sang</ORGANIZATION> , about the slow pace ofthe media pool in exiting the room : " Reporters are the same everywhere . 
" Of course , that 's arguably an accurate observation . 
But probably not somethingyou want to tell the head of a government that the <ORGANIZATION>Committee</ORGANIZATION> to ProtectJournalists says is engaged in " a campaign of harassment and intimidation thathas specifically targeted the country 's few independent online journalists andbloggers .
