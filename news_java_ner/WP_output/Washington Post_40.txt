You hear that sound ? 
Is that <PERSON>Perry Como</PERSON> on the radio ? 
Because I 'm getting apretty strong <DATE>1953</DATE> vibe here.On the <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> campus , where students are still reeling from aRolling Stone article about an alleged gang rape that probably did n't happen , the backlash from the scandal was strong this week . 
And , predictably , it wasaimed at women on campus.Sorority sisters were ordered by their national chapters to avoid fraternityevents during bid night this <DATE>weekend</DATE> ; organizing " sisterhood events " for theirsafety was a suggestion . 
Some sororities went so far as to plan requiredstay-inside retreats . 
Are bedazzled chastity belts next ? 
Oh , wait ! 
It 's <DATE>2015</DATE> ? 
Mybad . 
I thought I had stepped into a time machine.Because this Wicked Stepmother edict of locking up the Sweethearts of Sigma Chisounds a lot like the rules in the <ORGANIZATION>Michigan State University Associated WomenStudents Handbook</ORGANIZATION> , 1953-54 . 
Lots of schools had rules like this in the era ofMRS degrees : " Women students may visit only those men 's residences where an officialhousemother employed by the college is present under the following conditions : ( 1 ) The housemother must be present . 
( 2 ) Women may not go above the ground floor . 
( 3 ) Women students may not visit in men 's residences during the morning hours . 
" See , back then , women were treated as though they could n't make decisions ontheir own , as though they were the problem when it came to unwanted sexualcontact , as though their behavior had to be moderated and controlled and theywere infantilized to keep young men from ravaging them.A housemother was their greatest defense ? 
How different is that from whathappened this week at <LOCATION>U-Va</LOCATION> . 
? 
It was an insult to the women as well as the men.It 's not like campus rape is not a huge problem all over the country , despitethe Rolling Stone debacle . 
One in 5 American women reports being sexuallyassaulted at some point in her life , according to the <ORGANIZATION>Centers for DiseaseControl</ORGANIZATION> and Prevention.There are many examples of the college rape problem - no need for a made-upstory sensationalized by a music-and-culture magazine to underscore that fact . 
( Listen in on a book club or a girls ' night out . 
You 'll be surprised at how manywomen tell their own rape stories . ) 
Or just look at the papers . 
This week , two <ORGANIZATION>Vanderbilt University</ORGANIZATION> footballplayers - <PERSON>Brandon Vandenburg</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cory Batey</PERSON> , both 21 - were convicted of rapinga 21-year-old neuroscience major . 
They dragged her around , slapped her on thenaked behind and took turns assaulting her.To make matters worse , <LOCATION>Vandenburg</LOCATION> recorded the assault and sent the video tofriends while it was happening . 
He then tried to say he should n't be heldresponsible because he just watched . 
The jury rejected claims that the men weretoo drunk to know what they were doing , and that a college culture of bingedrinking and promiscuous sex should be blamed for the attack.Seriously . 
That was their defense - that everyone 's doing it.In <DATE>2015</DATE> , we 're still a herd , even in our institutions of higher learning . 
Andit 's not just the guys who are guilty of heinous peer pressure.Have you seen the wave of wicked sorority grooming requirements burning it uponline ? 
Paging <DATE>1953</DATE> . 
Makeup ! 
" This means eyebrows waxed , roots dyed , nails done , hair curled orstraightened , makeup done in a neat and clean fashion , " one example said.Sororities issued PowerPoint presentations on acceptable shades of turquoise towear , appropriate hairstyles ( " No Waves ! " 
one memo screeched ) and onedictatorial diva simply said , " can not express how important Spanx are . 
" Yup , back to <DATE>1953</DATE> . 
Is your petticoat properly starched?What happened to crusading for your rights , both on campus and off ? 
The womenbefore you had to fight to get on campus , they had to fight to keep thehousemother from signing them in and out like property , they had to fight to getjobs and fight to keep them . 
We 're still fighting.By locking down the sorority sisters instead of fighting for their right to besafe , we assume the worst of our young women . 
And our young men.Shame on that defense attorney for trying to make the Vanderbilt rape a crime ofcampus culture . 
Shame on the people who refuse to make alcohol abuse - by menand women - part of this conversation . 
And shame on the people who have given upon raising good and decent men . 
Smart men who understand the difference betweenyes and no , power and passion and right from wrong , who have to take charge inthis conversation and lead the way in the cultural shift that must continue.And seriously , ladies , enough with the turquoise and unruly eyebrows . 
That ' spretty darn horrid , too.petula.dvorak@washpost.comTwitter: @petulad Ã¯ ... OE To read previous columns , go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak .
