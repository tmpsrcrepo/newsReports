This was <PERSON>Mark Emmert</PERSON> 's moment , the most important news conference of the NCAApresident 's career , the one time he could stand on a podium and send aresounding message that his organization mattered in the real world . 
And hefailed.The <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> president dropped the ball by not forbidding <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> to playfootball for at least a year in the wake of a child sexual abuse scandal , atragedy that went all the way to the top of the university and its main cashcow , <PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> 's poisoned program.Emmert took away money and scholarshipsand all but congratulated himself and theorganization for administering what he called " unprecedented " penalties , punitive measures that went far and beyond , he said , the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> 's sentencingguidelines . 
But he let the games go on.He merely showed us the same thing the late <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> , former <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> presidentGraham <PERSON>Spanier</PERSON> and two functionaries now facing criminal charges for their rolesin the cover-up showed us : that no matter how heinous the scandal , collegefootball must go on.With <DATE>Monday</DATE> 's decision not to pull the plug on the <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> program , Emmertand the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> essentially said that grade-fixing and paying players in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> - violations that led to the " death penalty " shutdown of Southern Methodist ' sfootball program for two seasons - was more egregious than former defensivecoordinator <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky</PERSON> molesting pre-pubescent boys in the footballbuilding 's showers even after <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> and others received eyewitness accountsof the behavior.Never has <PERSON>Emmert</PERSON> and his ineffective bureaucracy looked so afraid of the majorcolleges who line their coffers and pay their salaries . 
Never has a <MONEY>$ 60</MONEY> millionfine seemed driven by public relations.Yes , that money will go to organizations committed to the restoration of victimsof child sexual abuse . 
But <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> , the second-highest-grossing program inAmerica , will essentially be able to pay that fine by having a <DATE>2012</DATE> season.What <PERSON>Emmert</PERSON> did was not a complete slap on the wrist . 
Punishing Paternoposthumously , vacating every <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> victory after <PERSON>Louis Freeh</PERSON> 's independentreport concluded the late coach was part of the cover-up , was important . 
For itlet <PERSON>Jay Paterno</PERSON> and every last say-it-isn ' t-so-Joe loyalist know that theirfallen icon - the coach who passed <PERSON>Eddie Robinson</PERSON> to become the Division Icareer leader in wins last <DATE>October</DATE> - now has fewer wins than <PERSON>Bobby Bowden andBear Bryant</PERSON> , among others . 
<ORGANIZATION>Joe Pa</ORGANIZATION> is n't No. 1 . 
There . 
Given what we know now , ofcourse , he never was.The one tangible penalty was the drastic reduction in scholarships . 
Eighty-fiveplayers used to have their tuition , room and board at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> paid for . 
Now , just 65 kids have full-ride deals . 
That means <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> will not be competitivewith <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> or anyone else with tradition and talent in the BigTen for years to come.That 's almost as much salt on an open wound in <LOCATION>State College</LOCATION> as <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's statuebeing taken down and put in storage somewhere in the stadium . 
To the zealots whosaw <PERSON>Joe Pa</PERSON> and football as their religion , that 's akin to the ark of covenantbeing pushed into a nondescript warehouse at the end of " Raiders of the LostArk . 
" But <PERSON>Emmert</PERSON> did n't go far enough . 
<ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> needed to lose football for at leasta year . 
Saturdays in <LOCATION>Happy Valley</LOCATION> needed to remain silent for a fall . 
No NittanyLion paraphernalia needed to be sold , no steaks and sausage needed to crackle onthe grill outside Beaver Stadium.Look , innocent people who had nothing to do with the scandal were going to behurt . 
Every college football community suffers collateral damage when theirprogram goes awry , but none went awry like this one . 
The paragon of virtue <ORGANIZATION>thatPenn State</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> represented - among all the shady boosters paying Miamikids , all the lying and cover-up associated with <PERSON>Jim Tressel</PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION>Ohio State</ORGANIZATION> - wasa big lie , a ruse that ruined other children 's lives.After no one went to off-campus police at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> when they knew a kid ofmaybe 10 was raped in the showers , after those same people never even tried tofind out what became of that kid , the prism through which we view all evil incollege athletics changed forever.That 's why the facade of Pleasantville needed to go away . 
Having footballSaturdays return to campus in any fashion was giving the university back itsmost sacred possession , the main commodity that made grown men protect a programbefore a child . 
" There are no actions we can take that will take away their pain and anguish , " <PERSON>Emmert</PERSON> said of the victims , rationalizing later the decision to let footballcontinue at <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> State.This was his moment . 
And he and the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> , no matter how unprecedented thesanctions appear , failed when they did n't take away one football season from theuniversity.His organization stood toothlessly on the sideline while a former <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> director ' slaw firm did his homework for him , amassing millions of documents and testimonythat showed a star chamber of men covered up child sexual abuse at a big-timecollege football powerhouse.All the things deemed so consequential in <LOCATION>Emmert</LOCATION> 's world - appeasing theanti-BCS jihad , expanding the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> men 's basketball tournament , making sureevery kid accused of getting a free breakfast or his parents ' free airlinetickets was investigated to the fullest - now seemed trite compared to whathappened in Happy Valley.In their little world , <PERSON>Emmert</PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> were seen as stern . 
In the realworld , they cowered at the idea of taking <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> off all those <DATE>2012</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Big Tenschedules</ORGANIZATION> . 
Sadly , they let the season go and and made sure college footballremained king.wisem@washpost.comFor <PERSON>Mike Wise</PERSON> 's previous columns , visit washingtonpost.com/wise.More on the <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> sanctions : Sanctions include bowl ban , <MONEY>$ 60M</MONEY> fineHard Hits : Time to fix thingsHamilton : <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> shows surprising muscleAudio : <PERSON>LaVar Arrington</PERSON> 's reactionPaterno family : ' A panicked response'Players must decide whether to playOn Leadership : <PERSON>O'Brien</PERSON> 's tough road aheadPhotos : The <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> scandalEarly Lead : Too harsh or too lenient
