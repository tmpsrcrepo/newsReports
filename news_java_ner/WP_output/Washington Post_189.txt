Dear Carolyn : Am I doing the right thing ? 
I 'm single , mid-thirties , never had consensual sexwith a man . 
I was raped twice when I was little . 
I 've never had a relationshipand , frankly , do n't believe love exists . 
I have given up on finding a person tobuild a life with . 
I 'd like for sex to feel normal , to feel that someone couldfind me attractive . 
My plan is to go to a bar , meet someone and go home withhim . 
Three close friends have voted against the idea , citing disease , possibility of meeting a nut , etc . 
I 'm tired of being alone and feeling like Imust be the most repulsive thing anyone has ever seen . 
If I were the kind ofperson someone would have a relationship with , it would have happened by now . 
Ithink a one-night stand would at least give me some reassurance . 
What do yousay?Given Up on LoveIf someone asked me the best way to feel alone and repulsive , one of my firstsuggestions would be to go to a bar , meet someone and have a one-night stand.Your circumstances are unique and distressing , but seven years of mail fromseven years of unhappy people has a way of herding individual cases into adiscernible whole . 
One-night stands do n't work . 
Using sex to alleviateself-loathing does n't work . 
Giving up does not work.I could pretend I had as easy a list of things that do work , but you 've beenjerked around enough for several lifetimes , so I wo n't . 
Truth is , everythingthat works takes work . 
And an open mind , many trials , many errors -- and dumbluck , because no answer is for everyone.Therapy , for example . 
Life-saving when it 's good , hope-sucking when it 's bad . 
( In your case , I urge you , seek competent , experienced care . 
Try the Rape , <ORGANIZATION>Abuseand Incest National Network</ORGANIZATION> , 800-656-4673 . ) 
Faith is another example -- fillingor draining , depending on the vessel.Love is one that rarely disappoints and so deserves more credit from you . 
Youlove those friends , no doubt , and they you . 
There 's nothing that says a manca n't see in you what they do , if you 're willing to give the same . 
There 's alsonothing that says remaining single must mean you 're repulsive . 
Your friendsserve as proof that you 're not . 
And do n't say you meant physically , because Ido n't believe you . 
You led with the rapes . 
Any damage from those is internal -- and no one-night stand will repair it.Nor , frankly , would " building a life " with a man . 
I 'm going to have my Societyfor the <ORGANIZATION>Prevention of Simplistic Cornball Advice</ORGANIZATION> membership revoked for thesetwo paragraphs , but : You 're the only one in a position to declare yourselfworthy of love . 
So go find a mirror , and declare it.And then laugh at yourself for talking to a mirror.Believing yourself wo n't be so easy , obviously . 
That 's a matter of making amillion little decisions in your own favor , every day , from what to eat to whereyou go and with whom . 
Starting now.Starting with , " I 'm going to get professional help until my self-image is n'trepulsive . " 
And , " I 'm better than one-night stands . " 
And , " I was raped , notruined for life .
