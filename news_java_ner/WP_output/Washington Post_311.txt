Andamong those invited to speak was a future presidential candidate : <PERSON>Rick Santorum</PERSON> , http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/rick-santorum-courts-conservative-christians-as-evangelicals-embrace-him/2012/03/19/gIQAOhaFMS_story.html-URL-whose faith had become soessential to http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/does-rick-santorum-want-religion-in-government-or-government-out-of-religion/2012/02/27/gIQAH14VeR_blog.html-URL-his politics that onfederal documents he listed the trip , paid for by an Opus Dei foundation , aspart of his official duties as a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> senator from Pennsylvania.In a speech at the gathering , <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> embraced the ideas of Opus Dei founderJosemaria Escriva , who had urged ordinary Catholics to bring an almost priestlydevotion to Catholic principles in every realm of life and work.During <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> debates about abortion , <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> told the audience in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> , hehears Escriva telling him that " it is not true that there is opposition betweenbeing a good Catholic and serving civil society faithfully . " 
In his public fightto uphold " absolute truths , " <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> said , " blessed Josemaria guides my way . " " 
' As long as you are making straight for your goal , head and heart intoxicatedwith God , why worry . . . Ã¢ [ #x 20ac ] [ #x 160 ] ? ' " 
<PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> said , quoting <LOCATION>Escriva</LOCATION> , according to a transcript of the speech.Within the story of how <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> grew up and decided to run for president , thereis the story of a boy who grew up to become ever more devoutly Catholic , ajourney all the more relevant as <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> has vigorously asserted a role forreligious conviction in the realm of governance.On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> , <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> will face http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/mitt-romney-rick-santorum-in-tight-race-in-illinoiss-primary-poll-shows/2012/03/11/gIQA1PiC5R_blog.html-URL-a showdown with <PERSON>Mitt Romney</PERSON> inthe <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> Republican primary , which comes after http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/santorum-wins-in-mississippi-alabama/2012/03/13/gIQATN5SBS_story.html-URL-significant wins in <LOCATION>Alabama</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> . 
In his victory speech lastweek , <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> - http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fblogs%2Felection-2012%2Fpost%2Fkaren-santorum-husbands-presidential-run-is-gods-will%2F2012%2F02%2F23%2FgIQAhCkdWR_blog.html&ei=6JxnT6TAOMbx0gGes-y2CQ&usg=AFQjCNE1DSHRct-LxMAcF2XBNdl8oAAbsw&sig2=4Le00HF6dadIneWO_gRcAg-URL-whose wife has said her husband believes " God is calling " him to seek the presidency - said what he hears most often from voters is " I ' mpraying for you . 
" The man they are praying for was raised in the liberalizing church of the early1970s and has since taken several turns toward the deeply conservativeCatholicism that now anchors his worldview . 
There was his marriage to KarenGarver and the influence of her devoutly Catholic parents . 
There was the deathof <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> 's infant son Gabriel in <DATE>1996</DATE> . 
All have been part of the candidate ' spublic narrative.Less well known is <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> 's embrace of the Catholicism of Opus Dei , arelatively small yet influential group within the church that is defined by theintensity with which followers are urged to live out church doctrine - inEscriva 's words , to " seek holiness " in all realms of life.The group encourages " unity " between followers ' personal and public lives asCatholics , the rigorous practice of church sacraments and , to some degree , gestures of self-denial . 
Its most devoted members follow a daily two-hour ritualof wearing a spiked metal chain on their thighs to recall Christ 's suffering - apractice followed by Mother Teresa.Santorum , whose campaign declined several requests for comment , is not a memberof Opus Dei , according to the group , and it is not clear to what degree headheres to its tenets.But Opus Dei , whose name is Latin for " Work of God , " has become a significantpresence in his life . 
<PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> has for years attended a church with a number ofOpus Dei followers and other affiliations with the group , and he has sent two ofhis sons to a school run by Opus Dei members . 
Among his family friends is theRev . 
C. <PERSON>John McCloskey</PERSON> , an Opus Dei priest who is a spiritual mentor to manyprominent <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> conservatives . 
McCloskey traveled to <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> , led him on a retreat with the group and baptized one of his children . 
" He was attracted to Escriva and the spirit of Opus Dei , the idea of layCatholics . . . giving Jesus Christ a presence in the workplace , " said <PERSON>MonsignorWilliam Stetson</PERSON> , a priest with the organization who knew <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> after he leftthe <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>2007</DATE> . 
By then , <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> had come to embrace a version of Catholicism far removed fromthe one he knew in the early <DATE>1970s</DATE> , when church rituals were relaxing , whenCatholic kids were being taught to see moral complexity , and when <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> , ayoung teenager then , developed a rapport with a freewheeling Franciscan priestwho spoke of Catholicism in terms of moral shades of gray.Shades of graySantorum 's introduction to faith came while he was growing up in the hilly,working-class town of <LOCATION>Butler</LOCATION> , at a time when parishes were embracing thehistoric new policies of the <ORGANIZATION>Second Vatican Council</ORGANIZATION> , which sought to make thechurch more relevant to a changing world.Priests who had said the Mass in <LOCATION>Latin</LOCATION> with their backs turned began facing thecongregation and saying it in English . 
Folk Masses became common . 
Even Godappeared gentler : In one <PERSON>Butler</PERSON> church , a parishioner recalled painters erasingthunderbolts alongside a portrait she understood to be the Almighty andreplacing them with a blue sky and angels.At the veterans hospital where <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> 's parents worked and his family lived , change came in the form of the Rev. <PERSON>Alex Mullaugh</PERSON> , a priest who was assigned tothe chapel on the hospital grounds , where <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> was the only altar boy.Father <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> , as he was known - a tall figure in sandals and a brown robe - madean impression , said <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> 's younger brother , <PERSON>Dan</PERSON> . 
" He was just a younger , cooler guy , " recalled <PERSON>Dan Santorum</PERSON> . 
" He 'd sometimes comeover to the pool . 
You did n't think of a priest going swimming , so it was justdifferent . 
" A neighbor , <PERSON>Ray Stierer</PERSON> , said Father <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> and his childhood friend " just hit itoff . " 
" He was always there , " <PERSON>Stierer</PERSON> said , referring to <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> 's friendship withMullaugh . 
" It just came out of nowhere . 
" In a recent interview , <PERSON>Mullaugh</PERSON> said he " pushed the envelope " of churchtradition , roaming up and down the chapel aisles giving sermons that aimed to " stir people up . " 
" I remember saying that there were gray areas , " recalled <PERSON>Mullaugh</PERSON> , who left thepriesthood in <DATE>1975</DATE> and is now a retired computer salesman living in <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> . 
" I remember saying that there are a lot more letters in the alphabet than A andZ and we need to use all of them . 
" Santorum heard similar lessons at the Catholic school he attended until theeighth grade . 
In religion classes there and at <LOCATION>St. Paul</LOCATION> church , where he wasconfirmed , young priests , some wearing jeans and longer hair , talked aboutmorally complex situations . 
" I remember discussions about how it 's not always clear what the right choiceis , " said <PERSON>Amy Pierce</PERSON> , a classmate of <ORGANIZATION>Santorum 's</ORGANIZATION> . 
Mullaugh said <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> absorbed those ideas . 
" He just seemed to be so serious , " he said . 
" Such a serious kid . 
" Finding claritySantorum 's first turn away from the gray-area Catholicism of his youth came whenhe met his future wife , <PERSON>Garver</PERSON> , around <DATE>1988</DATE> . 
She had only recently ended a six-year relationship with an obstetrician andabortion provider 40 years her senior . 
Her relationship with <PERSON>Tom Allen</PERSON> - whodelivered her in <DATE>1960</DATE> - had led her to drift from her devoutly Catholic family.Santorum , a lawyer moving toward his first campaign for <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> , describedhimself as " a nominal Catholic " at the time . 
" I did n't like the idea of abortion - I knew it was wrong , but I was n't sure ifit was the government 's business to do anything about it , " he wrote in his 2005book , " It Takes a Family . 
" Then came a dinner at the home of <PERSON>Garver</PERSON> 's parents , and a discussion aboutabortion , and then , recalled her mother , <PERSON>Betty Lee Garver</PERSON> , " we had them watch atape that we had , called ' Meet the Abortion Providers . ' 
" In the video , people introduced as doctors and nurses who formerly performedabortions graphically described the procedures , their words accompanied byphotographs of what appeared to be dismembered fetuses in trash cans . 
" They just sat there crying , " <PERSON>Betty Lee Garver</PERSON> said in a brief interview at herPittsburgh home . 
" And they became instantly pro-life . . . . With this and whenthey started to have children , they started to think more about their faith . 
Ithink through the years maybe they watched us , " she said , referring to herselfand her husband . 
" And we are devout Catholics , not cafeteria Catholics . 
" <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> has said that switch to being firmly opposed to abortion had to do withhis reading of scientific literature , but also with his religion.In the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> , he crusaded against what some opponents call " partial-birth " abortion , saying in a <DATE>1996</DATE> floor speech that there must be " some sort of moralcode in this country . 
" At the time , <PERSON>Karen Santorum</PERSON> was pregnant with the couple 's fourth child andbegan to develop serious complications . 
Their son http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/karen-santorum-opens-up-about-miscarriage-128/2012/03/05/gIQAHwJCtR_video.html-URL-Gabriel was born prematurely and died two hours later . 
They tookhim home and buried him the next day.Betty <PERSON>Lee Garver</PERSON> said the loss caused her son-in-law to " go deeper " in hisfaith . 
And in the years after , both he and <PERSON>Karen</PERSON> spoke of " God 's purpose " inGabriel 's short life.In <PERSON>Karen Santorum</PERSON> 's <DATE>1998</DATE> book , " Letters to Gabriel , " she includes a kind ofexhortation to her husband , writing : " Your daddy needs to proclaim God 's messagefor life with even more strength and devotion to the cause . 
" A ' turn away from God ' That same year , <PERSON>Rick Santorum</PERSON> met <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> , the Opus Dei priest , and began toassert his faith more publicly.He started a prayer group in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> . 
McCloskey enlisted <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> 's help inconverting then-Sen . 
<PERSON>Sam Brownback</PERSON> ( R-Kan . ) 
to Catholicism . 
And in <DATE>2002</DATE> , <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> traveled with <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> to <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> for the conference on Escriva.It was there that <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> , in response to a reporter 's question , first publiclyrejected a speech in which <PERSON>John F. Kennedy</PERSON> , speaking as a presidential candidatein <DATE>1960</DATE> to voters wary of his Catholicism , affirmed that his religious viewswould not dictate his public policies . 
<PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> said it had caused " much harm inAmerica . 
" In his address , <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> embraced <ORGANIZATION>Escriva</ORGANIZATION> 's view that it is " absurd " to leaveone 's Catholicism aside in conducting politics . 
He said that " as an American , and as a public figure , I am deeply troubled by this turn away from God . 
" The crux of the speech was a point that <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> returned to several times . 
" Without a shared belief system that is held and enforced , " he said , " a culturedisintegrates into moral chaos . 
" For guidance on these matters , <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> said , he turns to " blessed <LOCATION>Josemaria</LOCATION> . 
" The speech was his first public embrace of the organization Escriva founded in1928 , which now has about 90,000 members worldwide , including 3,000 in theUnited States.The group has been criticized in the past by former members as " cult-like " andpraised by other members and a succession of popes for its strong commitment tochurch teachings and loyalty to the Vatican.About <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of its members are " supernumeraries , " who can marry , whileabout <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> are " numeraries , " who live in celibacy . 
Numeraries typicallywear the spiked chain and perform " the discipline , " occasionally strikingthemselves with a braided cord as a reminder of Jesus 's suffering.Brian <LOCATION>Finnerty</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> spokesman for Opus Dei , said that the group has noexpectation with regard to political positions , but encourages " coherence " between religious principles and politics , especially for Catholic politicians . 
" Any person who is either voting or acting in public life should base his or heractions on these fundamental principles , " <PERSON>Finnerty</PERSON> said.In <DATE>2002</DATE> , the scandal over sexual abuse by priests was shaking the CatholicChurch , including <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> 's former parish in <LOCATION>Butler</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>St. Paul</LOCATION> , where one of theyoung , long-haired priests of the <DATE>1970s</DATE> was accused of molesting three boys , including a classmate of <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> 's , and placed on leave that April.It is unclear whether <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> knew that when he gave a speech in <DATE>July</DATE> , expressing " profound sympathy " for victims and blaming the abuse on the moralrelativism he had just spoken of in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> . 
" Priests , like all of us , are affected by culture , " he said . 
" When the cultureis sick , every element in it becomes infected . 
" What was needed , he said , was greater fidelity to church teachings instead of " watered-down versions of our faith . " 
' We are all sinners ' When two of <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> 's sons were around the age he was when he met Father <PERSON>Alex</PERSON> , he sent them to the Heights , a private liberal arts boys school in <LOCATION>Potomac</LOCATION> runby Opus Dei members . 
Its headmaster , <PERSON>Alvaro de Vicente</PERSON> , is a numerary.When <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> is home in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , he attends <ORGANIZATION>St. Catherine of Siena</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>GreatFalls</LOCATION> , one of the few churches in the diocese that host a monthly Opus Deispiritual meeting . 
A priest from the group comes in to hear confessions.Santorum often attends the noon Mass in <LOCATION>Latin</LOCATION> . 
" We are all sinners , " the Rev. <PERSON>Alexander R. Drummond</PERSON> said one recent <DATE>Sunday</DATE> , faulting Catholics for accepting a world in which " every possible sin [ is ] exalted . 
" In a <DATE>2008</DATE> speech at <ORGANIZATION>Ave Maria University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> strongly echoedthat idea.He said that Satan has used " the great vices of pride , vanity and sensuality " tocorrupt universities , politics and even most Christian churches , except one . 
" You say , ' The Catholic Church ? ' 
No , " <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> said , explaining that Satan aimedat the country 's Protestant roots . " 
. . . If you look at mainline Protestantismin this country , it is in shambles . 
It is gone from the world of Christianity . 
" <DATE>Three years later</DATE> , <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> has incorporated those views into a campaign thathas steadily gained momentum . 
On <DATE>Friday</DATE> , he traveled to <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> , the nextcrucial state in the Republican primary battle . 
On a day of rallies andfundraising , he spent half an hour meeting with <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> , the Opus Dei priest.mccrummens@washpost.commarkonj@washpost.comMcCrummen reported from <LOCATION>Butler</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION> ; <ORGANIZATION>Markon</ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> .
