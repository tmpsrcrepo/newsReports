Below is an excerpt from " On Faith , " a daily online religion section sponsoredby <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> . 
Each week , <PERSON>Jon Meacham</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sally Quinnengage</PERSON> figures from the world of faith in a conversation about an aspect ofreligion . 
This week , On Faith asked panelists whether the news media were beingfair to the pope . 
Is the media biased against the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> or itshierarchy ? 
How would you advise the pope?Media decides , then reports : Some quarters of the media in the past few weeksseem to have a difficulty in getting stories right and fair . 
Fact-checkers andskeptical editors may have gone the way of dinosaurs . 
Some media appear to citepeople for inflammability and absurdity , not knowledge . 
At times it seems thatbias abounds , libel runs freely and scrutiny lies by the side of the road.Mary <PERSON>Ann Walsh</PERSON> , director of media relations , <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Conference of CatholicBishopsPope 's opportunity to talk : Is the press biased and unfair ? 
Some are ; someare n't . 
But so what ? 
Trying to make the story about the bias of the press is ablatant dodge of legitimate questions about the behavior of abusive priests andcovering-up bishops . 
To own his rightful place as the moral leader of theCatholic Church , the pope needs to stop running away from this conversation andjoin the dialogue that will allow the Holy Spirit to heal the crisis in hischurch.Janet <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> , co-moderator , More Light PresbyteriansAn institution accustomed to kid gloves : Far from being biased against the pope , the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> or the hierarchy , I think the mainstream media are being onthe whole eminently fair . 
Of course , that is the problem . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> has longbeen accustomed to deferential , even fawning treatment by most mainstream mediaoutlets , especially on the searing-hot topic of clergy sex abuse . 
Fairness isunfamiliar -- and <PERSON>stinging.Tom Flynn</PERSON> , executive director , <ORGANIZATION>Council for Secular HumanismMedia</ORGANIZATION> bias and Catholic bashing : One of the hallmarks of bigotry is thecollectivization of guilt . 
By that measure , much of the criticism against thepope has been nothing if not Catholic bashing . 
From militant atheists likeChristopher <PERSON>Hitchens</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richard Dawkins</PERSON> indicting the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> as a " child-raping institution " to newspaper cartoons branding all Catholic clergy asmolesters , the evidence is clear that anti-Catholicism is alive and <PERSON>well.Bill Donohue</PERSON> , president , <ORGANIZATION>Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights</ORGANIZATION>
