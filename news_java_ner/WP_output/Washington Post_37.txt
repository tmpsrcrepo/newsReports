" Yeah , I mean , [ former president <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> is ] a predator , a sexual predator , basically . 
Repetitive - you know there 's dozens , or at least half a dozen , public women who have come forward . " 
- Sen. <PERSON>Rand Paul</PERSON> ( R-Ky . ) 
, in an interview with " The <PERSON>Steve Malzberg</PERSON> Show " onNewsMax TV , <DATE>Feb. 5</DATE> , 2014The Fact Checker does not quite perceive the strategic logic behind Sen. <PERSON>RandPaul</PERSON> 's attacks on former president <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> as a " sexual predator . " 
Is heputting <PERSON>Hillary Rodham Clinton</PERSON> on notice that this stuff is fair game if shedecides to run for president ? 
Is he trying to dampen enthusiasm for theDemocrats ' biggest fundraiser ? 
Is he trying to say that Democrats are hypocritesin the " war on women " ? 
That 's for political pundits to decide . 
We are interested in his use of numbers.He first referenced " dozens " of women but then amended that to " at least a halfa dozen public women who have come forward . 
" Is that really correct?The FactsPaul 's office declined to answer questions about how the senator reached thiscount , which is unfortunate because there are some definitional issues.The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a sexual predator as " a person who hascommitted a sexually violent offense and especially one who is likely to commitmore sexual offenses . " 
That 's a pretty harsh claim , but in his variousinterviews , <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> appears to be placing <PERSON>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON> on the list of <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> " victims . 
" That was a consensual affair , but <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> appears to take umbrage with the factthat she was 22 when the affair started and <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was the boss . 
" Having sexwith an intern at the office is inappropriate by any standard , " <PERSON>Paul toldNewsmax</PERSON> TV . 
On C-SPAN 's " Newsmakers " show , he described <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> as " some kind of abusive boss that uses their position of authority to takeadvantage of a young woman - a perpetrator of that kind of sexual harassment . 
" <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> 's point is a bit muddled . 
On the one hand , he is using terms that suggesthe is talking only about women who were allegedly the subject of sexualviolence . 
But then he also cites women who became lovers when <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was in anexecutive position.Let 's first compile a list of consensual liaisons admitted by the women inquestion : lGennifer Flowers.A model and actress whose claim of a long-term affair nearlywrecked <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> 's first run for the presidency in <DATE>1992</DATE> . 
( <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> denied herclaim at the time , but under oath in <DATE>1998</DATE> he acknowledged a sexual encounterwith her . ) 
lMonica Lewinsky.Intern at the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> whose affair with <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> fueledimpeachment charges.lDolly <PERSON>Kyle Browning.A</PERSON> high school friend who said in a sworn declaration thatshe had had a 22-year off-and-on sexual relationship with <ORGANIZATION>Clinton.lElizabeth Ward Gracen</ORGANIZATION> . 
A former <LOCATION>Miss America</LOCATION> who said she had a one-night standwith <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> while he was governor - and she was married . 
She went public tospecifically deny reports that he had forced himself on her.Perhaps one could claim that <PERSON>Lewinsky</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gracen</PERSON> had relations when <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> wasin a position of executive authority . 
But both clearly appear to be consensual.Now let 's look at the list of women who came forward and alleged an unwantedsexual encounter : lPaula Jones.A former <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> state employee who alleged that in <DATE>1991</DATE> Clinton , while governor , propositioned her and exposed himself . 
She later filed a sexualharassment suit , and it was during a deposition in that suit that Clintoninitially denied having sexual relations with <PERSON>Lewinsky</PERSON> . 
<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> in <DATE>1998</DATE> settledthe suit for <MONEY>$ 850,000</MONEY> , with no apology or admission of guilt . 
All but <MONEY>$ 200,000</MONEY> was directed to pay legal fees.lJuanita Broaddrick.The nursing home administrator emerged after the impeachmenttrial to allege that <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> had raped her 21 years earlier . 
<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> flatlydenied the claim , and there were inconsistencies in her story . 
No charges werebrought.lKathleen Willey.The former <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> aide claimed that <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> groped her inhis office in <DATE>1993</DATE> , on the same day when her husband , facing embezzlementcharges , died in an apparent suicide . 
( Her story changed over time . 
During adeposition in the Paula Jones matter , she initially said that she had norecollection about whether <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> kissed her and insisted he did not fondleher . ) 
<PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> denied her account , and the independent prosecutor concluded that " there is insufficient evidence to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubtthat President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> 's testimony regarding <PERSON>Kathleen Willey</PERSON> was false . " 
Willeylater began to claim that <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> had a hand in her husband 's death , even thoughher husband left behind a suicide note.Note that there is a pattern with these claims . 
As political analyst KirstenPowers put it in a column for <ORGANIZATION>USA Today</ORGANIZATION> , " Paul surely knows that no court of lawever found <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> guilty of the accusations . 
" <PERSON>Peter Baker</PERSON> , in " The Breach , " the definitive account of the impeachment saga , reported that <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> investigators later found in the files of the independentprosecutor that <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> 's lawyers had collected the names of 21 women theysuspected had had a sexual relationship with <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> . 
<PERSON>Baker</PERSON> described the filesas " wild allegations , sometimes based on nothing more than hearsay claims ofthird-party witnesses . " 
Some of the allegations , involving a state employee anda babysitter , suggested unwelcome advances.But <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> ca n't possibly be citing claims concerning unnamed accusers . 
Whensexual harassment claims were made against <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> presidential hopeful <PERSON>Herman Cain</PERSON> , <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> dismissed them because the women refused to publicly identify themselves.He said such anonymous allegations should never have been the subject of a newsstory . 
" To libel someone 's character and not put your name on it , I think isinappropriate and should n't be printed , " he told the National Review.The Pinocchio TestUnder the most generous accounting , one can find just three women who publiclycame forward with claims of sexual assault , but none was ever proven in a courtof law . 
Paul apparently also includes <PERSON>Lewinsky</PERSON> on this list , although that isdebatable given that she was an adult and never claimed that she was sexuallyharassed . 
( Indeed , she testified that the affair started after she flashed herthong at the president . ) 
Paul needs to get his facts straight , rather than cavalierly toss out claims of " dozens " or " half a dozen " women publicly claiming that <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was a sexualpredator . 
That 's a serious charge to make , which <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> certainly recognizes givenhis defense of <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> . 
The number of public claims amounts to three - and thereare enough questions about each of those allegations to wonder why Paul isscreaming " sexual predator " in the first place .
