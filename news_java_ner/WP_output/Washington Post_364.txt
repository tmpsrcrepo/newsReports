A WOLF AT THE TABLE By <PERSON>Augusten Burroughs</PERSON> ( unabridged , 9 hours , MacmillanAudio : 8 CDs , <MONEY>$ 29.95</MONEY> ; audible.com download : <MONEY>$ 20.97</MONEY> ) There has long been an impulse in the publishing business to make audio booksmore entertaining by introducing sound effects and music or by mountingfull-cast performances . 
Though this often propels a production out of the realmof literature into theatrics , there are books that were born for bells andwhistles , and <PERSON>Augusten Burroughs</PERSON> 's A Wolf at the <ORGANIZATION>Table</ORGANIZATION> is one . 
This fifth memoirof abuse and excess is read , bleated , rumbled and , at times , tearfully shoutedby the author himself . 
The audio book includes sound effects and occasionalinstrumental music , and it breaks new ground by presenting four songs writtenexpressly for the production.There is one each from <PERSON>Patti Smith</PERSON> , <PERSON>Ingrid Michaelson</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Sea Wolf</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Tegan Quin</PERSON> ( " Augusten , if I write something beautiful will it squash the hurt that isliving deep inside of you ? " ) 
. 
The songs smack vaguely of the New Age and make acurious contrast with this book , whose foul-breathed , skin-rotting , monster-metamorphosing creepiness transports the listener straight into StephenKing territory . 
Comic passages are rare , though one -- a brilliantly executedrendition by <PERSON>Burroughs</PERSON> of his father 's emotionally obtuse , professorialdisquisition on " ought " -- is a triumph . 
This is really an audio book for fansof <PERSON>Burroughs</PERSON> , and maybe of horror . 
Others will find most of it harder to takethan the author 's previous memoirs , which , if they did not possess the ring oftruth , were at least grotesquely funny.UNACCUSTOMED EARTH By <PERSON>Jhumpa Lahiri</PERSON> ( unabridged , 10 hours , <ORGANIZATION>Random House</ORGANIZATION> Audio : 8CDs , <MONEY>$ 39.95</MONEY> ; Books on Tape , www.booksontape.com : Collector 's edition , 6cassettes or 8 CDs : <MONEY>$ 64</MONEY> ) <PERSON>Sarita Choudhury</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ajay Naidu</PERSON> share the narration of <ORGANIZATION>Jhumpa Lahiri</ORGANIZATION> 's splendidand deeply moving collection of eight short stories , <ORGANIZATION>Unaccustomed Earth</ORGANIZATION> . 
Eachtakes full custody of three stories , and they share two , handing off thenarration as it switches between female and male points of view . 
This and anintroductory and concluding passage of music are the audiobook 's only frills.Though both narrators are actors , they maintain low-key reading voices , a mutedstyle that is entirely in keeping with <ORGANIZATION>Lahiri</ORGANIZATION> 's narrative temper . 
Indeed , theplainness of the performance grants these extraordinarily poignant stories ofdislocation , alienation and loneliness their full potency . 
Both Choudhury andNaidu read most of the text in American accents -- appropriately , as most of thecharacters are second-generation Indian Americans -- but they do deliver fineIndian cadences when characters demand it . 
It would have been nice if <ORGANIZATION>Naiduhad</ORGANIZATION> n't pronounced Nice biscuits " nice , " but that is where criticism of thisperformance ends.THE SWORD IN THE STONE By <PERSON>T.H. White</PERSON> ( unabridged , 9 3/4 hours , <ORGANIZATION>Naxos AudioBooks</ORGANIZATION> , www.naxosaudiobooks.com : 8 CDs , <MONEY>$ 54.98</MONEY> ; audible.com download : <MONEY>$ 20.95</MONEY> ) A Royal Academy of Dramatic Art-trained actor , <PERSON>Neville Jason</PERSON> brings a fullrepertoire of voices to <ORGANIZATION>T.H. White</ORGANIZATION> 's Arthurian tale , The Sword in the Stone . 
Hedelivers the narrator 's passages with kindly , avuncular calm and gives eachcharacter his or her own voice . 
Among them is Wart ( the boy <PERSON>Arthur</PERSON> ) , filled withyouthful eagerness ; his friend <PERSON>Kay</PERSON> , tinged with callow conceit ; Sir Ector , bluffly benevolent ; <PERSON>Merlin</PERSON> , schoolmasterly ; and wicked , wicked <ORGANIZATION>Madame Mim</ORGANIZATION> , malevolence incarnate ( " Oh , what a lovely baby ! 
/ How nice it would go withgravy " ) . 
The beasts and fish speak like English country folk for the most part , though the night congregation of hawks sounds marvelously like a mixed group ofShakespearean players and ex-colonials . 
And then there is valiant , stubborn KingPellinore , zealously what-what-ing over hill and dale in hapless pursuit of theQuesting Beast . 
The text of The Sword in the Stone was left in some disarray atWhite 's death , but <PERSON>Naxos</PERSON> has produced a fine version that should transfix yourwhole family , perhaps on some <DATE>summer</DATE> quest of its own.WORLD WITHOUT END By <PERSON>Ken Follett</PERSON> ( unabridged , 45 1/2 hours , Penguin Audio : 36CDs , <MONEY>$ 59.95</MONEY> ; Books on Tape , www.booksontape.com : Collector 's edition , <MONEY>$ 103.20</MONEY> ; audible.com download , <MONEY>$ 41.97</MONEY> ) Quite another <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> from days of yore emerges from <PERSON>Ken Follett</PERSON> 's World WithoutEnd , which at over 45 hours approaches endlessness itself . 
This is a big read , addictive when taken through the ear , an old-fashioned family saga with all thefixings : murder , rape , treachery , foul machinations , doomed love , obsessivehatred , intoxicating suspense and liberal helpings of sweet revenge . 
Set in <DATE>the14th century</DATE> ( viz . 
Black Death ) , it is a sequel of sorts to <PERSON>Follett</PERSON> 's enormousPillars of the <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> , set 200 years earlier . 
The book 's main characters areMerthin , a self-made man , and <ORGANIZATION>Caris</ORGANIZATION> , feisty and a healer -- a trait de rigueurin medieval heroines . 
The book is read by a virtuoso of historical novelnarration , <PERSON>John Lee</PERSON> , whose mellifluous voice comes with a Celtic torque . 
Hekeeps the cast of characters separate with discreet modifications of tone andaccent , effects that express their dominant character traits . 
Though one couldnever imagine taking the time to actually read this book , <PERSON>Lee</PERSON> 's performancemakes it an enthralling salvation from the tedium of 21st-century tasks.Katherine <ORGANIZATION>A. Powers</ORGANIZATION> , who regularly reviews audio books for Book World , writes aliterary column for the <ORGANIZATION>Boston Globe</ORGANIZATION> .
