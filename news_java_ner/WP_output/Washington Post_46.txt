However , at issue is whether <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> did enough when presentedwith an eyewitness account of one of the alleged assaults in the showers of <ORGANIZATION>thePenn State</ORGANIZATION> locker room and to what degree he is responsible for everything thathappens in the program over which he has presided for 46 years.Athletic Director <PERSON>Tim Curley</PERSON> , to whom <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> relayed the report of the allegedassault , and <PERSON>Gary Schultz</PERSON> , the university 's senior vice president for financeand business , have been charged with failing to notify authorities when toldof the alleged assault .

The statement also said that at <DATE>Friday</DATE> 's regular meeting itwould appoint a special committee to investigate the allegations.On <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> , when the <LOCATION>Harrisburg</LOCATION> Patriot-News devoted its entire frontpage to an editorial calling for university president <PERSON>Graham Spanier</PERSON> to stepdown and for this to be <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's last season as coach , hundreds of reportersdescended on campus to hear the coach answer questions for the first time sincethe grand jury report was released.Forty-eight minutes before <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's weekly news conference was scheduled tobegin , <PERSON>Jeff Nelson</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> 's assistant athletic director for communications , read a statement in front of roughly 150 reporters outside an entrance toBeaver Stadium . 
" Due to the ongoing legal circumstances centered around the recent allegationsand charges , we have determined that <DATE>today</DATE> 's press conference can not be held andwill not be rescheduled , " <PERSON>Nelson</PERSON> said.Then he tried to walk away , but the media horde followed , allowing him only toinch down the sidewalk as a <DATE>1957</DATE> matador red <ORGANIZATION>Chevy Bel Air</ORGANIZATION> drove by with acardboard cutout of <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> in the backseat.The news conference cancellation set off an at times surreal pursuit of Paternoby media members , and the media reports inspiredrallies of support for the manwho is affectionately known as " JoePa . 
" A short distance away from where <PERSON>Nelson</PERSON> made the announcement , dozens of tentswere propped up outside the southeast corner of Beaver Stadium .

" I just hope he did the right thing , becausehe is such a great part of <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Late <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> , hundreds of <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> students marched in support ofPaterno down <LOCATION>College Avenue</LOCATION> , the main drag through campus . 
They cheered , screamed and blocked traffic , on the way to Old Main , the university ' sadministrative nerve center . 
At one point , the song ' Sweet <PERSON>Caroline</PERSON> ' blared froman apartment along the route.Police in riot gear helped to disperse the crowd , which later moved on towardBeaver Stadium , chanting pro-Paterno and anti-Sandusky messages.Earlier in the <TIME>evening</TIME> , students http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/post/penn-state-students-rally-to-support-joe-paterno/2011/11/08/gIQAMNny2M_blog.htmlcrowded in the street outside <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's ranch-style brickhouse at 830 McKee Street.One student held a sign that read : " Occupy McKee Street . 
We are the <PERCENT>99 %</PERCENT> thatbelieves JoePa deserves to stay . 
" They chanted and cheered to see <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> , and finally he obliged .

He immediately was swarmed by students and media . 
" We want Joe ! "
