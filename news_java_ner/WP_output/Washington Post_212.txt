Hollywood is reportedly at work on a remake of the <DATE>1991</DATE> film " Do n't Tell Mom theBabysitter 's Dead . " 
This , however , is unnecessary , because a remake is alreadyplaying . 
It 's called the Republican presidential primary.In the original , a mom leaves her kids with a babysitter for three months , butafter the babysitter dies of a heart attack , the children fend for themselvesfor the summer.The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> nominating contest so far follows a very similar plot . 
With thegrown-ups ( played by <PERSON>Jeb Bush</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mitch Daniels</PERSON> ) out of town , the field has beenleft in the custody of caretakers ( played by <PERSON>Mitt Romney</PERSON> , <PERSON>Donald Trump</PERSON> and NewtGingrich ) . 
When even the babysitters fail to show up at the first debate of theseason , the juveniles run the thing themselves.At <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> 's debate in <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> , libertarian Rep. <PERSON>Ron Paulexplained</PERSON> why heroin and prostitution should be legal and why the Department ofHomeland Security should be eliminated.Retired pizza executive <PERSON>Herman Cain</PERSON> explained why the Internal Revenue Serviceshould be abolished and why people who would allow abortion in cases of rape andincest are " pro-choice . 
" Former <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> governor <PERSON>Gary Johnson</PERSON> argued for eliminating the minimum wageand corporate taxes and for cutting Medicare nearly in half.Former <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> senator <PERSON>Rick Santorum</PERSON> attempted to explain why he criticized " radical feminism " for pushing women into the workforce and why he said <PERSON>Islamwas</PERSON> " stuck in the seventh century . 
" Former <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> governor <PERSON>Tim Pawlenty</PERSON> declared the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> a " patheticorganization . 
" On a day when President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> placed a wreath at Ground Zero , his would-bepresidential opponents looked comparatively childish . 
Half an hour into thedebate , <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> interrupted moderator <PERSON>Chris Wallace</PERSON> . 
" It 's , like , nine questionsfor all these guys and none for me , " he protested.If there 's any good news for the Republican Party to come out of the firstpresidential debate , it 's that the <ORGANIZATION>Associated Press</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> did n't cover it.In the absence of adults , the first presidential debate favored the noisiest andthe least likely to win . 
<PERSON>Cain</PERSON> , a man who wants to return to the gold standard , had the most successful line of the <TIME>night</TIME> when he defended his inexperience . 
" I ask people , ' Most of the people in elective office in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> , theyhave held public office before . 
How 's that working for you ? ' " 
the formerGodfather 's Pizza boss said . 
" We have a mess ! 
" GOP pollster <PERSON>Frank Luntz</PERSON> , doing a focus group for debate-sponsor <ORGANIZATION>Fox News</ORGANIZATION> , reported that he had seen a massive shift in voter sentiment toward the man fromGodfather 's Pizza ( motto : " A pizza you ca n't refuse " ) . 
" This is unprecedented ! 
" <PERSON>Luntz</PERSON> said of the candidate in the godfather-style double-breasted suit.Contrast that with <PERSON>Pawlenty</PERSON> , arguably the only one of the five men on stage whohas a chance of winning the nomination . 
He elicited boos from the crowd when hetried to explain his shift away from a cap on greenhouse-gas emissions . 
" I waswrong . 
It was a mistake and I 'm sorry , " he pleaded.Pawlenty 's explanation : " If anybody is perfect , come on up here and stand bythis podium , because we would like that person to be running for president . 
" At this point , the Republicans would settle for somebody well short of perfect.There remains a hope that a white knight will arrive to rescue Republicanprimary voters from this lackluster field , but there is growing concern amongparty elders that such a person may not exist.There 's Romney , but he 's the paternity-denying father of Obamacare . 
There ' sTrump , but he 's the midwife of the birther campaign . 
Gingrich has been rejectedby his peers and married three times.Could it be that <PERSON>Herman Cain</PERSON> really is the best they 've got?There certainly is something intriguing about him . 
Consider , for example , hisAfghanistan plan : He does n't have one . 
" No , " <PERSON>Cain</PERSON> admitted when asked if he had a policy . 
He explained that " at thispoint , I do n't know all of the facts . 
" In their opposition to <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> , the five men agreed . 
What they could n't agree onwas a consistent counter-argument . 
<PERSON>Cain</PERSON> defended his claim that <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's actionon gay marriage is " bordering on treason . " 
Paul defended his proposed end to allforeign aid , including <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> 's , saying it 's not as if " every Jew in thiscountry believes we ought to have the policy we have . 
" Late in the debate , <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> was asked about a suggestion by one of the missinggrown-ups , <PERSON>Daniels</PERSON> , that Republicans should call a " truce " on social issues . 
" Anybody that would suggest that we call a truce on the moral issues does n'tunderstand what <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is all about , " <PERSON>Santorum</PERSON> inveighed.We 'll just have to let the kids fight it out on the playground.http://live.washingtonpost.com/dana-milbank-live-0506.htmldanamilbank@washpost.com
