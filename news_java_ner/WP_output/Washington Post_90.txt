You know Sarge from the <ORGANIZATION>Beetle Bailey</ORGANIZATION> comic strip ? 
Beetle 's hot-tempered " boss " peppers many of his conversations with @ * # $ , or sometimes the good old * <MONEY># $ &</MONEY> andthe ever-popular * <MONEY>$ #</MONEY> * & <MONEY>$ #</MONEY> @ ! 
Does that sound like your boss ? 
Or perhaps even you?As workdays grow longer and workplaces grow more casual , so , it seems , growsworkplace cussing . 
Sure , it may have been around for a while , but many see it asmuch more prominent today . 
And with that comes some workplace problems.I 'm sure most of us throw a few swear words around here and there . 
I wo n't tellyour mom -- or your kids . 
But those few words can cause much larger issues insome cases.First of all , you never know whom you are offending , even if you 're simplycursing at your computer.One reader asked if cussing in the workplace is now the " corporate cool . " 
Shewas mortified when her 16-year-old daughter came to work with her and heard thefoul language that the adults in the company used.James <PERSON>V. O'Connor</PERSON> , author of the book " Cuss Control : The Complete Book on How toCurb Your Cursing " ( <ORGANIZATION>Three Rivers Press</ORGANIZATION> , <MONEY>$ 12.95</MONEY> ) , stated the " cursing in theworkplace " issue rather succinctly : " It just adds a little extra tension . 
Theythink they 're venting , but it actually causes more stress . 
" O'Connor first began his stop-the-swearing mission about six years ago . 
Hebecame tired of hearing all the swearing in public , and he realized all thewords that disturbed him were words he used himself . 
He found the bad-languagehabit a tough one to break and started doing some research . 
Then he wrote thebook and began speaking to groups about the subtle dangers of cursing.A few people have benefited from listening to <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> 's ( curse-free ) <PERSON>talks.John R. Wagner</PERSON> , founder of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION>Wagner Group</ORGANIZATION> advertising agency , realized that his " loose " creative workplace was also one of constant swearing . 
" There was more cussing going on here than at a law firm or a newspaper , " hesaid . 
" Sometimes temperamental , creative people are outspoken . 
And sometimes itbecomes a task to deal with that environment . 
" <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> 's company does n't have any no-swearing rules , but it does try to controlthe bad-mouth bantering . 
" We 're not a real conservative bunch by any means , " hesaid . 
" But it just affects the environment , particularly with clients . 
You wantto make sure you 're creating the right impression . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>Wagner Group</ORGANIZATION> learned from <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> that there are good alternative words forthe four-letter ones . 
They also learned to think about speaking as if onnational television . 
The reason ? 
There are certain words that ca n't be said onthe air . 
If everyone takes that as a standard , they learn self-control . 
So , what 's the big deal?A lot of the swearing we do is " expressing negativity -- complaining , criticizing , grumbling , " <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> said from his office near <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> . 
" Notshowing a spirit of cooperation and a can-do attitude employers look for does n'thelp your career . 
" And ultimately , he said , swearing in the workplace can result in legal issues . 
" Cases of sexual harassment and violence never talk about the swearing . 
Butviolence begins with them fightin ' words , " <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> said.In the case of <ORGANIZATION>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Ball-Foster GlassContainer Co.</ORGANIZATION> , a <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> court said a company 's failure to stop a femaleemployee from harassing other female workers constituted sexual harassment . 
Thewoman 's use of sex-based epithets to other employees , her unwelcome andthreatening physical motions , and her sexually derogatory comments created ahostile work environment , the court held.The company tried to argue that the language was simply shoptalk , which it saidit does not monitor . 
But <PERSON>Sandra Radtke</PERSON> , the employment and labor lawyer on theaccuser 's side , argued that the language was much more intimidating than simpleworkplace cursing.Radtke won the case , but the situation shows the ambiguity , and possible dangerfor a company , of deciding how much swearing is too much or what sort of cursingis considered to be harassment.A 55-year-old woman who works at an agency on <LOCATION>Capitol Hill</LOCATION> has a hard timedealing with the day-to-day life in her office because of her co-workers ' language . 
She finds a direct correlation between the amount of bad language themen in her office use and their attitudes toward women . 
No , she said , no man inher office has ever sworn at her , but just the same , it 's painful to be privy tothe bantering . 
The women in her office do n't curse as much as the men do , andthat seems to separate the sexes even more . 
" I really do cringe , " she said . 
" Sometimes they can get pretty rank . 
I 'm notonly embarrassed for myself , I 'm embarrassed for them . 
If they only knew howthey look . 
" <PERSON>Carl Jaskolski</PERSON> is a convert . 
A few years ago , he supervised five people . 
Theyknew they swore , and really , they knew it was n't a good thing . 
So they set up aswear jar . 
Each curse word uttered would result in a quarter in the jar . 
Theysoon found their pockets empty , and they realized just how much time they spentusing curse words.But it was n't until <PERSON>Jaskolski</PERSON> heard a preacher years later that it hit him : Those words were not necessary to get a point across . 
The preacher made hispoint without turning the air blue , so why could n't others , <PERSON>Jaskolski</PERSON> wondered?Jaskolski now teaches a workplace-language course at <ORGANIZATION>Milwaukee Area TechnicalCollege</ORGANIZATION> , as well as human-resources and labor law at <ORGANIZATION>Concordia UniversityWisconsin</ORGANIZATION> . 
In his research , <PERSON>Jaskolski</PERSON> has tracked court cases that involvelanguage in the workplace . 
Employers are often found liable for not dealing witha person who was abusive with language . 
" The common denominator in any kind ofharassment is language , " he said.Which may be why a language code he drafted in late 2000 , much like a dresscode , is starting to catch on among <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> companies.He has received more than 120 requests for the policy . 
Seventy percent of thosewho have requested it were women who work in industries including manufacturing , banking , social services and even a religious retreat , he said.His view may be a bit rosy . 
My guess is we 're all going to continue to drop afew swear words here and there , but perhaps not so many . 
After all , saysO'Connor , workplace swearing was n't always so prominent . 
" Things go wrong at work . 
Everyone has problems . 
Computers do n't work . 
You ' restuck in traffic . 
It 's not going to go away by swearing , " <PERSON>O'Connor</PERSON> said . 
" Backin the old days when you could n't swear anywhere , you just dealt with it .
