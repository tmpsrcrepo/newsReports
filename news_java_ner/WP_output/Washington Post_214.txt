I am pleased to report that the members of the <ORGANIZATION>Fairfax County School Board</ORGANIZATION> didtheir homework . 
Most of them read the book -- all 983 pages . 
And I am happy tosay that this week 's seminar , in which the board debated whether to ban KenFollett 's " The Pillars of the Earth " from school libraries , was spirited andrespectful.But the bottom line is that by a 7 to 4 vote , the board said that only certainchildren will be permitted to read the book , ordering librarians to restrictcirculation to students in 10th through 12th grades . 
This is the third time injust over a year that the <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> board has bowed to a campaign by a handful ofparents who are proud of their anti-intellectualism and intent on deciding whatyour kids may read.Some of the books that Parents Against Bad Books in Schools ( PABBIS ) havedeclared " bad " are classics . 
Some are poorly written , sensational books designedto capitalize on the current passion for stories of victimization and identitypolitics . 
But literary quality has nothing to do with these parents ' objections.They scour texts for bad words , violence and sex.The group 's Web site is a lurid catalogue of sexually explicit and bloodypassages from books by <PERSON>Gabriel Garcia Marquez</PERSON> , <PERSON>Alice Walker</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Umberto Eco</ORGANIZATION> andJames <PERSON>Michener</PERSON> ( ! ) 
as well as far lesser writers.Around the nation , the book-banning campaign has eased up a bit , in part becauseschools have caved in , permitting parents to demand alternative readings if theydo n't like what teachers assign . 
But in <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> , the censorship campaign is justgetting rolling . 
On the <ORGANIZATION>American Library Association</ORGANIZATION> 's list of the 100 MostChallenged Books of the <DATE>1990s</DATE> , " The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn " and " Of Miceand Men " make the top 10 . 
Number 1 on the <DATE>2000</DATE> list : the <PERSON>Harry Potter</PERSON> books ( violent , Satanic , anti-family ) . 
The <PERSON>Follett</PERSON> novel -- a <DATE>1989</DATE> bestseller about the construction of a cathedral inthe Middle Ages that is a recommendation in most school librarians ' catalogues -- has naughty words , violence and descriptions of sexual behavior that neitherfeminists nor fundamentalists endorse.Board members were , for the most part , revolted . 
" I contemplated readingexcerpts from the book , but frankly , I could n't , " said board member <PERSON>Mychele B.Brickner</PERSON> ( At Large ) . 
But she had heard enough to know the book must go . 
" Shouldthis school system follow popular culture as they sink into the pit of depravityin music , movies , particularly rap music ? 
" Board member <PERSON>Rita Thompson</PERSON> ( At Large ) read the book but wishes she had n't . 
" Itencourages acts of sexual abuse , " she said . 
" It promotes raging acts ofviolence . " 
I 've missed the <PERSON>Ken Follett</PERSON> riots , but <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> 's jeremiad turned thetide against " Pillars . 
" Nothing the book 's supporters said mattered . 
Not even <ORGANIZATION>Hunter Mill</ORGANIZATION> board memberStuart <PERSON>D. Gibson</PERSON> 's quotation of <PERSON>Benjamin Franklin</PERSON> , who said , " They that can giveup essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither libertynor safety . 
" Board member <PERSON>Gary A. Reese</PERSON> ( Sully ) agreed that the bad guys in the book paid fortheir misdeeds with their lives , " and that 's history . 
But , you know , so is thefact that the Emperor Tiberius loved little boys . 
That 's history -- but . . . it 's not age-appropriate . 
" <PERSON>Cathy Belter</PERSON> , a librarian , was one of the few board members to consider theradical notion that other times had other values and that violent scenes in a1,000-page tome on medieval architecture do not necessarily mean <ORGANIZATION>Fairfaxteenagers</ORGANIZATION> will arrive at school bearing crossbows and catapults.Note that <PERSON>Follett</PERSON> 's book is not assigned to any classes in <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> . 
It just sitsin some libraries , where it has been checked out all of five times in the pastyear . 
But that wo n't stop <PERSON>Kathy Stohr</PERSON> and <PERSON>Richard Ess</PERSON> , the parents leading thePABBIS campaign.Ess , a project manager for the <ORGANIZATION>Department</ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> who has five children inFairfax schools , found " Pillars " on a list of 24 books from which his15-year-old daughter at <ORGANIZATION>Thomas Jefferson High School</ORGANIZATION> had to pick one . 
" Half thebooks had things like oral sex and gang rape , " <ORGANIZATION>Ess</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" We could n't findanything for her . 
" The girl chose the first chapters of the <LOCATION>Bible</LOCATION> , said her mother , <PERSON>Alice</PERSON> . 
" Sheknew the Bible anyway , so she did n't have to read it . 
" Stohr wanted a total ban on " Pillars , " but she 'll settle for partial victory.And she 'll be back : " Taking them one by one is the only way we can get them topay attention .
