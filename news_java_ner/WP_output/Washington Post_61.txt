THE BED IS TILTING!Or the couch , or whatever . 
A futon . 
Slanted.She had n't noticed it before , but now she ca n't stop noticing . 
Like the princessand the pea.By objective measure , the tilt is negligible , a fraction of an inch , but sheca n't be fooled by appearances , not with the sleep mask on . 
In her innerdarkness , the slight tilt magnifies , and suddenly she feels as if she mightslide off , and that idea makes her giggle . 
" I feel really , really weird , " she says . 
" Crooked ! 
" <PERSON>Donna Kilgore</PERSON> laughs , a high-pitched sound that contains both thrill andanxiety . 
That she feels anything at all , anything other than the weighty , oppressive numbness that has filled her for 11 years , is enough in itself tomake her giddy.But there is something more at work inside her , something growing from thelittle white capsule she swallowed just minutes ago . 
She 's subject No. 1 in ahistoric experiment , the first <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government-sanctioned research in twodecades into the potential of psychedelic drugs to treat psychiatric disorders.This <DATE>2004</DATE> session in the office of a <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>S.C.</LOCATION> , psychiatrist is beingrecorded on audiocassettes , which <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> will later hand to a journalist.The tape reveals her reaction as she listens to the gentle piano music playingin her headphones . 
Behind her eyelids , movies begin to unreel . 
She tries to saywhat she sees : Cars careening down the wrong side of the road . 
Vivid images ofher oldest daughter , then all three of her children . 
She 's overcome with anall-consuming love , a love she thought she 'd lost forever . 
" Now I feel all warm and fuzzy , " she announces . 
" I 'm not nervous anymore . " 
" What level of distress do you feel right now ? " 
a deeply mellow voice beside herasks.Donna answers with a giggle . 
" I do n't think I got the placebo , " she says.FOURTEEN YEARS AGO , <PERSON>Donna Kilgore</PERSON> was raped.When the stranger at the door asked if her husband were home , she hesitated . 
Notlong , but long enough . 
That was her mistake . 
" That was it , " <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> , 39 now , is saying . 
" He pushed in . 
I backed up and pickedup a poker from the fireplace . 
I was screaming . 
He says , ' I 've got a gun . 
If youcooperate , I wo n't kill you . ' 
He unzipped his jacket and reached in . 
I thought , this is it . 
This is how I 'm going to die . 
My life did n't flash before my eyes . 
Iwas n't thinking about my daughter . 
Just that one cold , hard fact . 
I checked out.I could feel it , like hot molasses pouring all over my body . 
I went completelynumb . 
" She dropped the poker.Afterward , she stayed strong . 
She was n't going to make the classic victim ' smistake of blaming herself for provoking the attack . 
She had no doubts aboutthat . 
She 'd screamed and screamed until the police came through the door . 
( Theylater reported that her attacker jumped up , clutching for his pants , saying , " She said I could ! " ) 
And , bottom line , she 'd survived . 
She 'd be fine , she told herself . 
She waswrong . 
" It was what it must feel like to have no soul , " she says . 
She quit all herhobbies . 
A passion for tennis died . 
Devastating nightmares woke her in the dark , her heart racing and palms slick . 
She dreamed of explosions , tornadoes , bearseating people . 
" Psychologists will tell you to go to your happy place , " she says . 
" Well , myhappy place had bears in it . 
" Five years passed . 
Whatever went wrong , or right , in her life , it felt like itwas happening to someone else . 
She found a wonderful , loving man -- she couldstill recognize those qualities , even though she could n't respond to them fully -- and remarried . 
She had more kids . 
But even her family felt alien . 
It was " almost like going overseas and being an exchange student , living with someoneelse 's family . . . I did n't like being close to people , and my children did n'tunderstand that . 
Mommy was always busy . " 
She was often irritable , and felt anunaccountable anger , which sometimes morphed for no obvious reason into aheavy-breathing , sweat-streaming rage . 
Almost worse , she could n't feel the loveshe knew surrounded her . 
" I was afraid it was gone -- when you look at yourchild and say , ' I would die for that child in a heartbeat , ' I did n't feel it -- and I was afraid I would never get it back . 
" As she says this , she never breaks eye contact . 
Talking about her trauma and hertreatment is a decision she 's made , she says . 
" It 's important . " 
But it is also , obviously , hard , and she looks a little pale as she explains what it was likefor those five years : " I would put my finger on my arm , and it would be liketouching a dead body . 
" Incredibly , she did n't see a connection to the rape . 
Then , one evening , she wassitting on her couch watching a disaster show on TV -- she calls her interest inthe genre " an addiction " -- when her apartment door opened . 
Something about theangle of it seemed odd . 
As she looked at the door , the room began to swirl . 
" Itwas kind of like a whirlwind , make-you-dizzy moment , and I saw the whole thing , that man pushing through the door , the warm molasses pouring down , my body goingnumb . 
I call it , ' when I left my body . ' 
" Now she understood : She had left her body -- and never come back.The panic attacks began at work one <DATE>Friday</DATE> . 
She felt butterflies in her stomach , then could n't breathe . 
" I thought : ' Oh my God , I 'm dying . 
I 'm having a heartattack . ' 
" It passed , but she was shaken , especially because she 'd also been havingfainting spells and migraine headaches . 
She went to a neurologist " sure theywere going to find a brain tumor . 
" The doctor was getting ready to order an MRI scan when <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> just blurted itout : " Things do n't feel real to me . 
" The doctor turned . 
" Oh ? 
There 's a word for that , " she remembers him saying . 
Theword is dissociation , which happened to be a prime symptom of post-traumaticstress disorder , or PTSD.PTSD is usually triggered by combat , rape , childhood abuse , a serious accidentor natural disaster -- any situation in which someone believes death isimminent , or in which a significant threat of serious injury is accompanied byan intense sense of helplessness or horror . 
Not all or even most trauma victimsdevelop PTSD , but enough do so that nearly 24 million Americans , or <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT> ofthe population , have suffered from it at some point in their lifetime . 
It isestimated that in any given year , more than 5 million Americans have active PTSD -- a costly problem in humanitarian and economic terms . 
Drug and alcohol abuseare all-too-frequent consequences of PTSD , as is loss of productivity and theneed for expensive , long-lasting medical treatment.The ever-lengthening <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> war will count among its other costs a legacy ofthousands of veterans in need of psychiatric treatment . 
The government estimatesthat already more than 50,000 soldiers -- about <PERCENT>4 percent</PERCENT> of those who have beendeployed to <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> -- have been treated for symptoms of PTSD . 
Manymore might actually have it : Military studies put the number at 12 to 20 percentof those returning from <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> and 6 to <PERCENT>11 percent</PERCENT> of those returning fromAfghanistan . 
And the news gets worse . 
" Vets with PTSD are particularly costly to the [ Veterans Affairs ] system , " <PERSON>saysLinda Bilmes</PERSON> , a lecturer in public policy at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy School ofGovernment</ORGANIZATION> . 
" They constitute <PERCENT>8 percent</PERCENT> of the claims , but <PERCENT>20 percent</PERCENT> of thepayments . " 
<PERSON>Bilmes</PERSON> , who has studied the ongoing costs of the wars , estimates thattreating <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> vets with PTSD over the <DATE>next 50 years</DATE> will cost taxpayers <MONEY>$ 100billion</MONEY> . 
This is based on findings that one-third of vets with PTSD will remainunemployable , and all suffering with PTSD will have a much higher than normallikelihood of needing treatment for physical ailments . 
And that 's just thedirect costs to the budget . 
" Assuming that the war continues , though with lowerdeployments , through <DATE>2017</DATE> , " she says , and assuming the rate of PTSD is n't beingunderreported , the cost of lost economic productivity to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economy willbe in excess of <MONEY>$ 65</MONEY> billion.Whatever the cause , the symptoms of PTSD are fairly consistent , and <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> 's -- which rated severe on a standard diagnostic test -- were typical . 
Her prognosiswas not great . 
Some antidepressants can diminish symptoms , and various forms ofpsychotherapy can , long term , sometimes untangle the psychological knot at theroot of the problem . 
But the nature of PTSD makes therapy problematic . 
The verysymptoms -- acute anxiety , heightened fear , diminished trust and inability torevisit the trauma -- are a direct roadblock to healing . 
At least one-third ofpeople with PTSD never fully recover.On that day of <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> 's first diagnosis , the doctor sent her up to the seventhfloor , the psych floor , to begin years of therapy and medication , none of whichhelped much , <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> says.And then she found <PERSON>Michael Mithoefer</PERSON> and became the first to take one of hislittle white capsules.THE CAPSULES RESIDE IN A SAFE , armed with an alarm and bolted to the floor ofMithoefer 's office , a 1950s-vintage cottage on the road between downtownCharleston and <LOCATION>Sullivans Island</LOCATION> . 
It 's been tastefully remodeled to create asoftly lit , high-ceilinged sanctuary in the back , scattered with art andfurnished with , among other things , the ever-so-slightly inclined futon whereDonna got crooked.The elaborate security is occasioned by what is inside the capsules : MDMA , asynthetic compound that is a chemical cousin to both mescaline andmethamphetamine . 
Unabbreviated , MDMA is a real mouthful -- 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine -- but it is far better known by its streetname , ecstasy , millions of doses of which are synthesized in criminal labs fromthe oil of the sassafras plant . 
At one point , <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> recounts , agents of <ORGANIZATION>theDrug Enforcement Administration</ORGANIZATION> , there to inspect the security arrangements , inquired about the therapist who rents the office adjoining the safe room . 
" I guess they were concerned she might drill through the wall into the safe andsteal the MDMA , " <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> says . 
" Though there 's such a small amount in there , and it 's so readily available on the street in such large quantities , I do n'tsee how that would be worth the effort , even if she were so inclined . 
" <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> became a psychiatrist in <DATE>1991</DATE> , after a decade as an emergency roomdoctor -- he had found himself less interested in the bodily traumas hispatients suffered than the psychological traumas that so often preceded theirappearance in the emergency room . 
He 's got that mellow , empathic vibe that theyjust ca n't teach at therapy school . 
He always seems moments away from asympathetic chuckle , an understanding murmur or a sage observation . 
A fit 61 , with a brown ponytail and relaxed dress code , <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> has become theaccidental point man of a movement to revive medical research into psychedelicdrugs . 
His Food and Drug Administration-approved PTSD study that began withDonna <PERSON>Kilgore</PERSON> in <DATE>April 2004</DATE> is now nearly completed , with 18 of 21 subjectshaving undergone the double-blind sessions . 
Two <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> veterans with war-relatedPTSD , the study 's first , are cleared to begin . 
Close behind are similar studiesin <LOCATION>Switzerland</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> . 
At <ORGANIZATION>Harvard 's McLean Hospital</ORGANIZATION> , researchers are set toevaluate MDMA therapy as a way to alleviate acute anxiety in terminal cancerpatients . 
In <LOCATION>Vancouver</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> , the effectiveness of an ongoing program to treatdrug addiction with another potent psychedelic drug , ibogaine , is underscrutiny . 
There is a proposal , based on case histories , to study the ability ofLSD to defuse crippling cluster headaches.All of these studies are directly or indirectly funded by a surprisingly robustorganization whose roots stretch back 40 years to the psychedelic movement ofthe <DATE>1960s</DATE> . 
Before <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> lecturer <PERSON>Timothy Leary</PERSON> started channeling aliens andurging college kids to turn on and drop out , an intense cadre of doctors andresearchers had come to believe that psychedelic drugs would revolutionizepsychiatry , providing those with a wide spectrum of psychological problems -- oreven just ordinary life difficulties -- the ability to , basically , healthemselves.But <PERSON>Leary</PERSON> 's bizarre career , which morphed from doing research on psychedelics tocheerleading their widespread abuse , obscured whatever medical potential thedrugs may have had . 
Instead , authorities focused on the risks , and oftenexaggerated them . 
<PERSON>Richard Nixon</PERSON> famously called <PERSON>Leary</PERSON> " the most dangerous man inAmerica . " 
After a slow start , regulators and legislators cracked down <MONEY>hard.Millions of dollars</MONEY> in enforcement efforts were unable to end abuse ofpsychedelic drugs , but they effectively stamped out sanctioned research intotheir healing potential.A small group of psychedelic researchers and therapists willing to break the lawcontinued their work clandestinely . 
A much larger group did not flout the law , but waited in the wings and is now emerging . 
Experience had convinced thesetherapists that psychedelics , along with significant risks , had potential foreven more significant benefits.This may have been especially true of MDMA.Mithoefer states the case in an article he wrote for a book of scholarly essays , Psychedelic Medicine : Social , Clinical and Legal Perspectives : " The reportedresults [ of early therapeutic use ] include decreased fear and anxiety , increasedopenness , trust and interpersonal closeness , improved therapeutic alliance , enhanced recall of past events with an accompanying ability to examine them withnew insight , calm objectivity and compassionate self-acceptance . 
" In short , a therapist 's dream . 
Or is it a hallucination?THE PROMISE OF A BLOCKBUSTER TREATMENT , one that does n't just address symptomsbut defuses underlying causes , is a particularly seductive vision right now . 
Areport issued last month by the <ORGANIZATION>National Academy of Sciences</ORGANIZATION> ' Institute ofMedicine emphasizes the uncertain effectiveness of current PTSD treatments , andthe urgent need of returning soldiers who will suffer from it.To a non-scientist , the very preliminary results of <ORGANIZATION>Mithoefer</ORGANIZATION> 's study wouldsuggest that MDMA might be just what the doctors ordered . 
Of the subjects whohave been through both the MDMA-assisted therapy and the three-monthpost-experiment follow-up tests , <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> reports , every one showed dramaticimprovement.But scientists are a cautious lot . 
" It 's potentially nice to hear those things , " says <PERSON>Scott Lilienfeld</PERSON> , an associate professor of psychology at <ORGANIZATION>Emory</ORGANIZATION> University.But until results are statistically analyzed and peer-reviewed for publication , " you ca n't really judge them . 
The plural of anecdote is not data . " 
Especiallywith a drug that has considerable risk , <PERSON>Lilienfeld</PERSON> cautions , it pays to beskeptical.A.C . 
<PERSON>Parrott</PERSON> , a psychologist at <ORGANIZATION>Swansea University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> who has devoted alarge part of his career to studying the dangers of MDMA , is far more thanskeptical . 
" MDMA is a very powerful , neurochemically messy and potentiallydamaging drug , " he says . 
The government " should never have given it a licensefor these trials . 
Certainly I would not give it a license for any furthertrials . 
" But one of the nation 's premier PTSD researchers , <PERSON>Roger K. Pitman</PERSON> , a professorof psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION>Harvard Medical School</ORGANIZATION> , disagrees . 
Morphine is a powerful , potentially damaging drug , <PERSON>Pitman</PERSON> says , " and we use it to treat the pain ofcancer patients . 
Sound medical reasons should trump . 
" Current treatment for PTSD is " partial at best , " he says . 
" There 's a lot of roomfor improvement , and we need to be looking for novel treatments . 
" Though <PERSON>Pitman</PERSON> calls the MDMA study " a fringe hypothesis " -- " I 've never heardanybody talk about it at any PTSD meeting I 've ever attended in 25 years " -- healso observes that , based solely on a description of the preliminary results , " this seems worth further study . 
A lot of new ideas meet with rejection andskepticism , and we need to be careful not to be prejudiced against somethingjust because it seems wacky . 
If it has a <PERCENT>5 percent</PERCENT> chance , or even a 1 percentchance , of being effective in treatment of PTSD , it 's worth pursuing . 
" AS THE SESSION TAPE ROLLS TOWARD THE FIRST HOUR , the giggles have passed . 
DonnaKilgore is still on the crooked couch , but she sounds very level . 
She 's talkingabout her husband . 
Her voice is clear , calm , but you can hear something in it , something rising in the throat like water from a newly tapped <DATE>spring</DATE> . 
" I just have a deep feeling of gratitude for all the love and understanding he ' sshown . 
I know it 's been tough on him , not understanding what I 've been goingthrough and not knowing how to help . 
But if it was n't for him , I do n't think I ' dbe here . 
" The study protocol requires that a hospital crash cart and a trauma doctor bepresent during all therapy sessions , in case the drug precipitates a medicalemergency . 
They are waiting a room away , a reminder that this is a test of apotent experimental drug , though you 'd never know that from the calm , sobertenor of the conversation . 
It 's really more of a monologue : <PERSON>Michael Mithoeferand</PERSON> his wife , <PERSON>Annie</PERSON> , a nurse and co-therapist , mostly listen , only occasionallymurmuring supportively . 
This is their treatment plan : Construct a reassuring , protective environment and " let the drug do its work . " 
" He used to spend a lot of time laughing and cutting up , " <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> continues abouther husband , " but things have gotten so serious . 
I love him with all my heart , but there just has n't been that warm fuzzy feeling , how you get excited everytime you see him . 
It 's put a damper on it . 
I do n't fully enjoy anything . 
I do n'tenjoy my kids . 
I do n't enjoy my dog . 
" It 's frustrating , just going through the motions <DATE>day after day after day</DATE> . 
Ido n't get any joy out of it . 
" She stops talking , and you can hear the faint strain of music coming from herheadphones . 
She takes a deep breath . 
The blood pressure cuff , on a five-minutetimer , starts to inflate . 
" It sucks to just exist , and not live , " <PERSON>Donna announces.FIRST</PERSON> SYNTHESIZED IN <DATE>1912</DATE> -- A BYPRODUCT IN THE MANUFACTURE OF A DRUG TOSUPPRESS BLEEDING -- MDMA was little known until a former <ORGANIZATION>Dow Chemicalresearcher</ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON>Alexander Shulgin</PERSON> tried it himself in <DATE>1977</DATE> . 
<PERSON>Shulgin</PERSON> had madehis reputation , and made Dow millions , by inventing the first biodegradablepesticide . 
After that success , he was able to work on whatever he chose . 
Hechose psychedelic drugs , based on a transforming experience he had withmescaline in the late <DATE>1950s</DATE> . 
" I understood that our entire universe is containedin the mind and the spirit , " he wrote . 
" We may choose not to find access to it , we may even deny its existence , but it is indeed there inside us , and there arechemicals that can catalyze its availability . 
" <PERSON>Shulgin</PERSON> made it his business to find those chemicals . 
In a <ORGANIZATION>New York Timesprofile</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>2005</DATE> , when <PERSON>Shulgin</PERSON> was 79 , he estimated that he 'd synthesized 200psychoactive compounds and tested them on himself . 
Their effects ranged fromparalyzing him with fear to granting him ecstatic visions . 
With MDMA , he wasconvinced that he 'd found something special . 
" I feel absolutely clean inside , and there is nothing but pure euphoria , " hewrote in his field journal . 
" The cleanliness , clarity , and marvelous feeling ofsolid inner strength continued . . . through the next day . 
I am overcome by theprofundity of the experience . 
" It 's not well understood why MDMA , or any psychedelic drug , can produceextraordinary experiences . 
But in MDMA 's case , the crude explanation seems toinvolve a drug-forced rush of serotonin in the brain . 
Serotonin assists in thetransmission of nerve impulses and plays a role in regulating a wide range ofsensations and impulses , from mood , emotion , sleep and appetite to sensation , pleasure and sexuality . 
One recent study pointed out physiological similaritiesbetween a brain under the influence of MDMA and the post-orgasmic state , alsoknown for producing emotional closeness and euphoria.Whatever the cause , <PERSON>Shulgin</PERSON> saw in the overwhelming positive feelings the drugengendered huge potential as an aid in the psychotherapeutic process . 
" I madesamples of it for a good therapist friend of mine , <PERSON>Leo Zeff</PERSON> , which brought himout of retirement and into the enthusiastic task of making it availableinternationally with his psychotherapy friends , " <PERSON>Shulgin</PERSON> recalls in an e-mail . 
" Its popularity spread in part by his enthusiasm , but in part by the fact thatits ability to open the doors of communication made it widely popular as asocial drug . 
" BY MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS , MDMA EMERGED AS A STREET DRUG IN <DATE>1984</DATE> at a new andinstantly hot <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> nightclub called <PERSON>Starck</PERSON> . 
Sold at <MONEY>$ 12</MONEY> a hit , MDMA -- whichZeff 's crowd had nicknamed <PERSON>Adam</PERSON> , for its presumed potential to return man toinnocent bliss -- became ecstasy . 
Part of the drug 's appeal was that it madedancing feel great , and staying up all night easy . 
But there was more . 
Here 's anaccount of first-time ecstasy use from that period , recalled in the AustinChronicle in <DATE>2000</DATE> : " The street lights got brighter , I could see the stars , car lights , even theshadows in this alley were , you know , more so . 
And I felt this tingle that beganin my fingers and spread all over my body , coming in waves , just thisindescribable feeling of aliveness . 
It was as if the nerves in my skin had beendormant all these years and were just now waking up and stretching . 
Just likethat . 
And after this initial rush of pleasure came an overwhelming -- and I meanover - [ expletive ] - whelming -- feeling of total and complete positivity . 
Any andall fears I had harbored about doing my first drug were waylaid instantly . 
Itwas pure bliss , but it did n't knock me off my feet , or feel scary in any way . 
" My girlfriend . . . and I . . . lay in the wet grass and watched the stars andcuddled . 
And we talked . 
We talked for hours . 
We talked about everything.Everything . 
It was probably the best , most open and honest conversation I ' veever had with anyone in my entire life . 
" Word-of-mouth reviews such as that fueled an explosion of recreational use . 
From1984 to <DATE>2001</DATE> , the graph line for the number of first-time users of MDMA in <ORGANIZATION>theNational Survey of Drug Use and Health</ORGANIZATION> quickly shot up , reaching a peak ofnearly 2 million new users in <DATE>2001</DATE> alone . 
Concern about the drug , spurred by aspike in emergency room visits from rave bars and MDMA-related deaths , went upright along with it . 
Ecstasy use has since tapered off , though it is stillsubstantial . 
The <DATE>2005</DATE> survey estimated that 11.5 million Americans had usedecstasy , and 615,000 had tried it for the first time that year . 
The average ageskewed young . 
In <DATE>2001</DATE> , <PERCENT>5.2 percent</PERCENT> of eighth-graders and <PERCENT>11.7 percent</PERCENT> of highschool seniors had tried ecstasy ( both numbers have been roughly cut in half inthe most recent , <DATE>2006</DATE> survey ) . 
When <PERSON>Zeff</PERSON> began his mission to spread the MDMA gospel in therapeutic circles , the drug was perfectly legal . 
But federal drug enforcement officials , who hadtaken half a decade to ban LSD , were n't about to delay on ecstasy . 
Within monthsof the rave boom in <LOCATION>Dallas</LOCATION> , officials announced they intended to list MDMA asSchedule I , the category reserved for dangerous drugs with high potential forabuse and no accepted medical use.Rick <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> was waiting for them.LIKE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE , <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> had discovered psychedelic drugs in collegein the early '70s . 
By his own description a somewhat awkward , searching kid , hetried LSD in <DATE>1971</DATE> at <LOCATION>New College of Florida</LOCATION> , then a small , experimental liberalarts school in <LOCATION>Sarasota</LOCATION> . 
Very liberal and very experimental . 
" There was thistradition of all-night dance parties , until sunrise , under the palm trees , usingpsychedelics , " <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> says . 
It was bacchanalian , yes , but <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> found somethingelse in the experience , something " therapeutic and spiritual . " 
" I was like , man , this is the kind of energy , the kind of psychic stuff " thatcould lead him to the personal growth he had been yearning for . 
Ironically , saysDoblin , " this was right as research into therapeutic uses was pretty much beingshut down . 
" <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> 's world was legally circumscribed in another way as well . 
He was a draftresister . 
" What could I possibly do with my life , because I could n't be alicensed anything , doctor , teacher a professional of some sort . 
All that wasclosed to me because I was a criminal . 
" As long as he was already an outlaw , <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> reasoned , be might as well be one ofthose who disregarded drug criminalization and worked underground as aself-trained psychedelic therapist . 
When he encountered MDMA in <DATE>1982</DATE> , he becameconvinced that he 'd found the perfect therapeutic tool , one that had an LSD-likepower to hurdle psychic roadblocks but lacked the frightening disorientation.Plus , it was still legal , and by then , so was <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> -- President <PERSON>Jimmy Carterhad</PERSON> pardoned draft resisters in <DATE>1977</DATE> . 
Now <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> had a vision : He would returnto the mainstream and bring psychedelic therapy with him.When , in <DATE>1985</DATE> , prohibition of MDMA came , as everyone knew it would , <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> hadalready prepared his case with a coalition of like-minded pro bono lawyers , researchers and therapists . 
He even won a round -- an administrative law judgeruled that MDMA met the standards for having a legitimate medical applicationand being safe enough for medical use . 
But the <ORGANIZATION>DEA</ORGANIZATION> rejected that recommendationand MDMA remained banned.Doblin , decided he could n't win in the courts and switched his crusade to thelab . 
He would focus on fostering the science that would prove the benefits ofpsychedelic therapy outweighed the risks . 
In <DATE>1986</DATE> , he founded a nonprofitorganization -- the <ORGANIZATION>Multidisciplinary Association</ORGANIZATION> for Psychedelic Studies -- toraise money for the research . 
( Knowing he would need to navigate through theobstacle course of federal bureaucracy , he entered <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy School</ORGANIZATION> ofGovernment and , in <DATE>2001</DATE> , received a PhD in public policy . ) 
On the elaborate MAPShome page -- alongside a psychedelic research library , the organization ' sfinancial statements , elaborate news updates and notices of psychedelic art forsale -- is a splash box featuring the MAPS " Rites of Passage Project . " 
It 's anextended pitch for the idea that " within responsible limits " parents cansometimes find great benefit in doing psychedelic drugs with their adolescentchildren , and includes an archive of testimonials with taglines such as " Mother-Son Peyote Ritual . . . a beautiful rite of passage a mother shared withher teenaged son , strengthening his family connection , his sense of self , andhis bond with nature . 
" <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> is frank about his passionate desire to defuse the drug war , which hebelieves is counterproductive and an assault on personal liberties . 
He does n'tthink the government should be able to tell Americans what to put in theirbodies , and he has even volunteered in interviews that he sometimes finds ituseful to consider important personal and strategic issues with psychedelicassistance . 
He acknowledges that his outspokenness caused a schism in theoriginal coalition that fought against relegating MDMA to Schedule I -- many ofhis colleagues wanted to stress their support for the criminalization of anynonprescription use . 
He has seen it jeopardize one of his most prizedaccomplishments -- MAPS funding of the Harvard MDMA-cancer study almost killedit . 
Doblin had to withdraw MAPS as a sponsor and persuade a donor to give themoney directly to <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> instead . 
He must realize he is handing his critics apotent argument , i.e. : Do n't be fooled by the careful science and limited goalsof the current studies ; the real goal is unrestricted use of psychedelic drugs.So , why does he do it ? 
" Sometimes , it 's just a relief to say , ' This is what Ibelieve , ' " <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> says.His honesty has apparently been no impediment to soliciting cash from fellowbelievers , which , fortunately for MAPS , include some entrepreneurs with a highregard for the psychedelic experience -- and a distaste for government drugpolicies -- who struck it rich in the tech boom . 
Last year , MAPS donationstopped <MONEY>$ 1 million.MAPS</MONEY> continues to fund <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> 's study , which is estimated to cost <MONEY>$ 900,000</MONEY> through completion . 
And <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> will raise money to support the much moreexpensive next step -- Phase III trials , which involve multiple sites andmultiple therapists who will treat hundreds of people suffering from PTSD . 
If itproves safe and effective , MDMA would be certified as a prescription drug . 
Thatall could take five years and <MONEY>$ 5 million</MONEY> , <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> says . 
" But if it took twicethat long and cost twice that much , it would be worth every penny . 
" <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> speaks far more cautiously of his eventual goal . 
" If MDMA indeedproves an effective treatment for PTSD , " not only should the drug requireprescription , but it should be administered only in licensed clinics withspecially trained therapists , " like methadone , " he says . 
Regarding <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> ' scontroversial views , <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> says : " I respect his openness . 
I think it 's agood thing that there 's nothing sneaky about <PERSON>Rick</PERSON> , but that 's not what I ' moriented toward . 
I 'm oriented toward doing medical research . 
There are realpatients suffering with real problems , and I 'm trying to learn through goodscience if there are some methods to help people heal . 
" MITHOEFER DOES NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH MDMA , exceptto say that it occurred when the drug was legal . 
But it must have stuck withhim . 
" I was working in the emergency department , looking for some deeper way toaddress people 's problems , " he recalls . 
" <PERSON>Stan Grof</PERSON> 's work really got myattention . 
" <PERSON>Stanislav Grof</PERSON> , a Czech psychiatrist and one of the first to researchtherapeutic uses of LSD , believed that the West had lost touch with the healingpotential of non-ordinary states of consciousness . 
When psychedelic drugs becameillegal in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Grof</PERSON> created an alternative called holotropicbreathwork . 
The idea was that hyperventilation , combined with music and aritualistic setting , could foster an altered consciousness , through whichpatients could be guided into insight and problem resolution . 
Mithoefer went toCalifornia to train with <PERSON>Grof</PERSON> , then began to use breathwork in his own practice.And though he says it is often effective , he wondered how much more could beaccomplished using MDMA . 
In <DATE>2000</DATE> , <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> approached <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> to ask if he knewof a country in which a study of MDMA-assisted therapy might be permitted . 
" You can do it here , " <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> said . 
" And we 'll help . 
" <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> says his optimism was based on a change in leadership and culture in thefederal bureaucracy . 
When he first founded MAPS , <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> says , " the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> wasrefusing to permit all the studies we proposed , " even one attempting to use MDMAtherapy to ease the fears of a dying cancer patient who had found solace usingthe drug before it was banned . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> said , ' No , we have to protect him frombrain damage , ' " <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> says.Then in <DATE>1992</DATE> , after six years of refusals , the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> approved a MAPS-funded humansafety study . 
Safety studies are required before any drug can move on to PhaseII -- studies of a specific medical application . 
In MDMA 's case , this wasparticularly important because many believed the drug to be so toxic . 
Eventalking about the possibility of therapeutic benefits would only make morepeople want to try it , some believed , and that would inevitably lead to moreemergency room visits . 
And deaths.More than 200 fatalities involving ecstasy use in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> werereported to the <ORGANIZATION>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</ORGANIZATION> from1994 to <DATE>2001</DATE> . 
Many of these deaths were related to traffic accidents and the useof other drugs and alcohol or other incidental causes . 
Of deaths directlyrelated to ecstasy , most were caused by heatstroke . 
MDMA exerts a stress on thebody similar to strenuous exercise and increases core body temperature , sodancing all night in a hot , crowded bar can quickly go from fun to deadly . 
Morerarely , some ravers , paranoid about hyperthermia , have reportedly consumed somuch water , many gallons , that the water itself became toxic and killed them.But , even in the context of uncontrolled doses and settings , deaths from MDMAare relatively infrequent events , considering the estimated tens of millions ofdoses taken.Perhaps of even greater concern was the possibility that MDMA could causepermanent brain damage . 
Though research is ongoing and hotly debated , it 's clearthat test animals injected with high doses experienced lasting deformation ofserotonin receptors in the brain.There were worrisome human studies as well : In some , long-term recreationalusers of ecstasy performed more poorly on tests for short-term memory and someother cognitive functions than control groups , though the meaning of theseresults is complicated by the fact that most long-term ecstasy users also useother dangerous drugs.The new safety study was not testing the dangers of MDMA under the conditions ofillegal use . 
Eighteen people were given dosages similar to those that would beused in psychotherapy sessions , and the settings were comparable to the calm ofa psychiatrist 's office . 
The gist of the findings : MDMA given under thosecircumstances produced no acute harm or evidence of brain impairment . 
Theseresults were bolstered by a Swiss study in which people who had never beforetaken MDMA were given brain scans before and after being given a singletherapeutic-range dose of the drug . 
Comparison of the before and after scansshowed no damage.Given those results , <PERSON>Doblin</PERSON> figured the time was right for persuading regulatorsto approve <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> 's proposal , a placebo-controlled , double-blind study ( meaning that neither doctor nor patient would be told who got the real drug ) . 
The safety study , and others done elsewhere , had made the case : Many valuablemedicines have been developed from far more problematic drugs.Doblin and the <PERSON>Mithoefers</PERSON> spent 18 months developing an elaborate protocol forthe study : Research subjects would be limited to people who 'd struggled with thedisorder for years , and whom conventional treatments had n't helped . 
The caseswould be relatively severe , as scored on the standard diagnostic test , andsubjects would be required to undergo multiple non-drug therapy sessions withthe Mithoefers before and after the two MDMA sessions to prepare them for theexperience and to help them process it afterward . 
The protocol dealt with suchdetails as what kind of touching would be permitted ( supportive , non-sexual ) , and what kind music would be played on earphones ( soothing ) . 
Submitted to the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>October 2001</DATE> , it was approved a month later.Then , in <DATE>September 2002</DATE> , the institutional review board engaged to guarantee thestudy 's ethics -- de rigueur for human medical research -- abruptly withdrew itssupport . 
A study published in Science magazine found that relatively small dosesof MDMA had created severe damage to the dopamine system in the brains ofsquirrel monkeys and orangutans . 
Dopamine damage could put human users at riskof developing Parkinson 's disease , among other problems . 
In the case of theprimate test subjects , the Science article said , the drug was so toxic that twoof 10 animals died , and two more were in such bad shape that the researchersdid n't give them a planned third injection.After 2 1/2 years of work , the PTSD study appeared to be <DATE>doomed.A year later</DATE> , Science printed a retraction : The vials containing the drugs thatso damaged the monkeys ' brains had been mislabeled . 
It was n't MDMA after all , but methamphetamine . 
A new review board quickly signed on to support <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> ' sstudy , but the irony of the wasted year was n't lost on him : The misidentifieddrug that had been deemed too toxic to evaluate for medical use , the drug thatwas far more toxic than MDMA , was already a prescription drug.Meanwhile , in the four years the MDMA study lingered between concept andreality , <PERSON>Donna Kilgore</PERSON> had been driven to the brink . 
She took " everyanti-depressant you can name , " tried a dozen therapists and an almost equalnumber of therapeutic approaches . 
But nothing made that numbness , panic and ragerecede . 
" I was getting to the point , " she recalls , " where it was either go sit on amountaintop or go dive off a cliff . 
" That 's when a therapist told her about the <ORGANIZATION>Mithoefers</ORGANIZATION> ' experiment . 
She applied , and became patient No. 1 . 
DONNA SPENDS A LOT OF HER TIME ON THE CROOKED COUCH holding the Mithoefers ' hands , one on each side . 
She needs that reassurance now , recalling the rape . 
" I was backed into a corner , nowhere to go , desperate . 
I kept telling him Iwould n't tell anybody , " she says.Can she feel that desperation now ? 
" A little bit , yeah . 
" Minutes pass . 
On the tape , you can hear the blood pressure cuff whir to life asthe amplified beat of her heart thumps faintly in the background.Finally she speaks , her voice rising with conviction . 
" I feel protected . 
I do . 
I feel completely protected . 
I do n't feel like I ' mhanging out there anymore . . . It feels good to be loved . 
It feels good to beprotected . 
" Minutes pass . 
She is lost in a vision , she will say later . 
She can see herselfstanding on a ridge , high above a valley shrouded in mist . 
Down in the valley , she knows , is a battlefield , containing all kinds of terrors . 
Her terrors . 
Sheknows they are there , but ca n't see their shape through the fog . 
Now the fog islifting . 
Now she can begin to see . 
" You 're right , " she says , as if in response to an assertion that has n't beenmade . 
" I am angry . 
I 'm angry at myself . 
It changed from being afraid to beingmad at myself , that I allowed it to happen . . . " And not just that , " she says . 
There 's a sudden , involuntary intake of breath . 
" I think that a lot of this baggage I 'm carrying around is really stuff that Iput in there myself . 
I stacked the luggage . 
Either in disappointment in myselfor self-blame . 
Do n't get me wrong . 
Under no circumstances do I think that Ideserved it or I asked for it or that I did something to bring that on . 
I do n'tfeel that way at all . . . It 's like you take your base line [ which is ] fear , and you throw some self-doubt on top of that , and then you throw somedesperation on top of that , and , before you know it , you got a seven-layerburrito going there . 
I mean I can feel every one of them . 
I do n't know how toexpress it , but I can feel them . . . just one right on top of the other , andmaybe I 've done that for so long , that when the rape happened , that was maybethe straw that broke the camel 's back , and my mind said , ' Okay , that 's enough , you 're cut off , no more . ' 
There 's no more room on the pile . 
" The Mithoefers murmur sympathetic words as <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> continues unburdening herself . 
" It 's not just about the rape . 
It 's not just about any one thing . 
It 's so manydifferent things . . . All I can remember feeling , as far as I can remember , isfear . 
Heart-stopping , gut-dropping fear . . . I 've kept all this inside for solong , and it feels so heavy . . . these emotions -- it 's like I 've been trainedto be this way as long as I can remember -- to be seen and not heard . 
Just fromthat point on , I 've tried to make myself as small and inconspicuous as possible.And then the rape happened , and you 're headline news . . . I was ashamed . 
" The study protocol calls for the therapists to periodically ask the subjects torate their level of distress on a scale of zero to 10 . 
" Zero , " <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> says quickly . 
Another pause . 
" No , that 's not entirely true . 
That ' sa lie . 
I would say about a two . 
It 's a disturbing revelation , I guess you couldsay . 
" Once again , she pauses . 
" I feel calmer , a whole lot calmer , " she says . 
" Kind of putting it all together , rather than just throwing it all in a box . " 
" OH , MAN , I 'M IMPRESSED , " SAYS <PERSON>MARK WAGNER</PERSON> , a clinical psychologist on facultyat the <ORGANIZATION>Medical University of South Carolina</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> , an expert inpsychological testing and an independent evaluator conducting the before andafter PTSD assessments in <ORGANIZATION>Mithoefer</ORGANIZATION> 's study . 
" I did n't know much about theclinical use of MDMA before this , " <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> says , " But I 've seen each and everyone of these patients , and , just as a clinical psychologist , it is impressive tosee the degree of treatment response these folks have had . 
There are a couple ofareas in medicine , like hip replacement , where one day you are bedridden , andthe next you 're out playing tennis . 
Or with Lasik surgery , you 're blind , andthen you can see . 
Nothing in psychology is like that . 
But this was dramatic . 
" <PERSON>Lilienfeld</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>Emory</ORGANIZATION> psychologist , is less enthusiastic . 
" These subjects knewif they got the drug or the placebo , " he says . 
" Particularly when you have avery dramatic and powerful intervention , people may change but not in alongstanding way . 
" <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> points out that two subjects who got the placebo were convinced they hadgotten MDMA , and others who did get it were n't sure . 
The people who wronglybelieved they 'd gotten the drug initially showed improvement , but quicklyrelapsed . 
" The chance that a placebo effect would last for three months is veryslight , " <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> says . 
" And for it to last for a year or more , which anecdotallywe believe might be the case here , would be extremely remote . 
" But if MDMA does work , the question remains , why ? 
" Patients in our study had afear of the fear , " <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> says . 
" Something about the MDMA made it possible forthem to approach the feared thought , the feared ' place ' in their mind -- andwhen they got there , it was n't as terrible as they thought . 
A lot of thesepeople , the light bulb went off , they had the insight , but there 's still a lotof work to do . 
They 've had this for years , it 's shaped their lives , and now theyhave to rebuild them . 
" In <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> 's Psychedelic Medicine article , he theorizes that the breakthroughscame from having the psychic calm -- the feeling <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> had of being protected -- that allowed subjects to meaningfully reexperience and reassess the events thattraumatized them , and at the same time be able to feel a powerful new connectionto positive aspects of their lives . 
In <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> 's case it was the love of herhusband and children . 
Another patient told <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> : " I had never before feltwhat I felt today in terms of loving connection . 
I 'm not sure I can reach itagain without MDMA , but I 'm not without hope that it 's possible . 
Maybe it 's likehaving an aerial map , so now I know there 's a trail . 
" For some subjects , the most significant part of the experience seemed to be aphysical release of mental anguish . 
In <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> 's article , he says one subjectexclaimed : " I can relax ! 
Forty-three years of fear and not being able to feel mybody . 
Now I can feel my body without pain . 
" Another subject , a 50-year-old woman named <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> , had one of the moredramatic physical releases . 
" I thought it was supposed to be talk therapy , thatI was supposed to talk about things , but it does n't have to be , " she says . 
" Thedrug itself will do the work . 
" Her trauma centered on a stepfather who viciously abused her and her brotherfrom an early age . 
She describes him as " a truck driver , ignorant , uneducated , <ORGANIZATION>Southern</ORGANIZATION> , moonshine-drinking , swearing , wife-beating idiot . 
He thought kids werethere for his entertainment , amusement and personal use . 
" From an early age , <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> was stuck in a grim survival mode . 
" Does n't matterwhat you do to me , you will never touch me , " is how she described it . 
" It was afeeling , all self-defense , all self-protection , nobody gets in . 
" Her whole life evolved , pathologically , from that premise . 
Running away as anadolescent from the horrors at home , she was raped , twice , by men who picked herup as she hitchhiked . 
With no real concept of love and nurture , she got involvedin a series of physically and emotionally abusive relationships . 
When somethingtriggered memories of her abuse , she froze in a nearly catatonic state , caughtbetween fight and flight , unable to do either.During her MDMA session , <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> says , she remembered that after her motherdivorced her stepfather , she 'd confided to <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> that he had been the bestlover she 'd ever had.As she talked about how that made her feel , <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> recalls , <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> " waspushing me verbally . 
I was mad , and he was pushing me , provoking me to feel it.I just kept getting madder and madder , hitting the bed . 
Then the drug just tookme and slammed me down . 
I was sitting one second , then down on my back in thenext . 
I became very rigid , the tension was so powerful . 
I remember lying on thebed where I slammed down , looking at Dr. <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> . . . like I 'm mad at him forputting me through this , and this wave of energy just slammed through me , and itwas just a release of a tremendous amount of this negative energy . 
It waspowerful , and it was explosive . 
I felt like I 'd been through somethingsignificant . . . My mother traded my childhood for sex ! 
" In the weeks following the therapy sessions , <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> says , she would bestanding in the kitchen , or just sitting in a chair at work , and without warningthat powerful release would move through her body . 
Afterward , she says , " I feltat ease , a level of ease I was not familiar with , just being comfortable withinmyself , within my body . 
" That feeling of ease has given her a new relationship with her life , she says.Difficulties continue , but " I 'm not having as much problem with the puzzle . 
I ' mable to just keep slugging away . 
I do n't feel so much like going to bed andsucking my thumb . 
" The problems do n't disappear , <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> says , they just become something thatcan be managed . 
" All subjects have told us they found MDMA helpful , " <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> says in hisarticle . 
" Some have felt the effect . . . was dramatic and even lifesaving : however , others have reported disappointment that MDMA was not a " magic bullet " to remove all their symptoms , or have said it would have been helpful to haveone or a few additional sessions . 
" <PERSON>Parrott</PERSON> , the MDMA critic from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> , worries that in some cases MDMA magnifiesnegative feelings instead of positive ones , and can bring up difficult memoriesthat may be overwhelming . 
It 's problematic , he says , that the outcome of therapysessions can be so dependent on the skill of the therapist.Mithoefer acknowledges that this is an issue and says that 's precisely why hebelieves that , if MDMA is ever prescribed , it should be administered only inlicensed clinics by specially trained therapists.Still a problem , says <PERSON>Parrott</PERSON> . 
" Those patients who had good experiences on thedrug would often want further-on MDMA sessions ( just like many novicerecreational users ) , " he writes in an e-mail . 
" This scenario is very worryingfor many obvious reasons : reducing efficacy but increasingly adverse effectsfollowing repeated usage ; drug seeking elsewhere when it stopped beingforthcoming from the clinic etc ; regular use leading to a variety ofpsycho-biological problems . 
" <PERSON>Wagner</PERSON> , who questioned all of <ORGANIZATION>Mithoefer</ORGANIZATION> 's subjects in detail about theirpost-therapy attitudes , thinks <PERSON>Parrott</PERSON> is way off mark . 
" I did n't see a singleindividual who thought : ' Oh , yeah , this is great fun . 
I 'm going to try to go outand use this for recreational use . ' 
All of them took this very seriously andtherapeutically . 
They saw it as hard , but important , work . 
" <PERSON>Amy</PERSON> , a woman in her 40s , is a case in point . 
She remembers being psychologicallyand physically abused by her father " from birth , " culminating one winter when helocked her in the basement for three weeks . 
She had a reaction to MDMA verydifferent from <LOCATION>Donna</LOCATION> 's instant giggles . 
When the drug started to take effect , she says , " It just hit me , and it was n't pleasant . 
I felt like I was going tothrow up . 
So I said , Okay , when 's this happy , lovey feeling going to happen ? 
Iwent to lie down on the couch and waited to go higher , but the drug took me downinstead . 
[ <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> ] was taking notes . 
I felt like he was drawing circles aroundme , but he showed me his notes , and they were just notes . 
That 's when I saw thatmy internal world and external world did n't match up , and I connected with that.I saw myself as a baby wrapped in a white blanket , my family members standingthere , and I realized , It was n't my fault . . . I was flooded with feelings ofpeace and safety . 
' It was n't my fault . 
I did n't do anything , ' I kept saying . 
' Iwas a little girl . 
I was a baby . ' 
" After the first session , I felt exhausted , like I had a really bad hangover.But everything continued to unfold . 
I started to make connections . 
Like goinginto the grocery store , I used to feel very alienated . 
I could n't connect withthe other shoppers . 
But after the first session , I realized I could look at thepeople , and I was n't afraid , like they were going to hurt me . 
I made theconnection between the way I was always sizing up my environment , the alienationand the numbness that I felt , and the abuse . 
" It felt weird at first , but kind of nice , that I could look at someone , andthey would look back , and we 'd smile at each other . 
" But like several other of the test subjects , <PERSON>Amy</PERSON> also confronted difficult newterrain . 
" Sometimes to go forward you have to go backwards , " she says . 
" I knewthat , but it was n't comfortable to go there , back into the basement , into theabuse , into the beatings . 
I was apprehensive . 
I had already started feeling moregrounded , but I 'd functioned so long on autopilot that feeling things wasdifficult . 
" Difficult , but also better . 
" So many things happened , " she says . 
" Before , Inever wore a seat belt . 
I would look at it but not wear it . 
It wasself-sabotage . 
But after therapy , without even thinking about it , I justautomatically started putting it on . 
" FOR A YEAR AFTER HER TWO MDMA SESSIONS , <PERSON>Donna Kilgore</PERSON> says now , she wassymptom-free . 
" To me , the biggest breakthrough -- it meant the world to me to be able to lookat the fear , to look at the shame . 
I did n't know I was ashamed . 
It was like I ' dbeen wearing the scarlet letter . 
It was so heavy . 
When I got out of thatsession , I felt a hundred pounds lighter . 
" Before , I knew the path was through the battlefield , but I just could not getthrough it . 
[ But during the MDMA therapy ] I knew I could walk through it , and Iwas n't afraid . 
The drug gave me the ability not to fear fear . " 
Otherwise , shesays , " I would have not been able to do it . 
" <PERSON>Donna</PERSON> 's sense that she 'd had a breakthrough was supported when she retook theevaluation test on which she 'd rated as an extreme case just weeks earlier . 
Herscore had declined dramatically -- <PERSON>Mithoefer</PERSON> says that he ca n't give an exactnumber before publication of results -- but if she had been taking the test forthe first time , she would not have been considered to have PTSD at all.It 's now been more than three years since her MDMA sessions . 
Donna is " stillextremely grateful for the experience , " she says . 
But problems are starting tocrop up again . 
" I 've had a lot of stressors recently , " she says . 
Her husband got laid off froma good job ; they had to move ; she had a difficult job at a dental practice forchildren.Donna was doing paperwork in the office . 
" It was n't in the best part of town , " she says , " and I started to have catastrophic thinking again . " 
It was theresurgence of the paralyzing , unreasonable fears characteristic of PTSD thatshe 'd had before the MDMA sessions . 
" I just started being convinced that someonewas going to come in with a gun and start shooting . 
And then I just could n'tlisten to the children screaming in the next room . . . " She says she had to quit the job . 
She begins to cry . 
" I know I can work through it , " she says , her voice breaking a little . 
" I knowwhat I 'm fighting now , and I can fight it . 
" Does she think it would help if she could have another MDMA therapy session ? 
" Yes , " she says quickly . 
" But I ca n't . 
It 's illegal .
