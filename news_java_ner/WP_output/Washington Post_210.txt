The <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> 's 444-page manual contains no language directly addressing appropriatepunishment for concealing information regarding child sexual abuse . 
But in lightof the shameful conduct of <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> 's leadership , revealed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> in theFreeh report , the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> must use its authority to do what 's needed now : shutdown the <ORGANIZATION>Nittany Lions</ORGANIZATION> football program.If the Freeh report released <DATE>Thursday</DATE> is accurate in its assessment of theuniversity 's role in the worst scandal in college sports history , then theengine that enabled longtime child sexual predator <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky</PERSON> must beswitched off , at least temporarily.The good news is that the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> is at least examining what its role should be inthis horrific mess.The organization is awaiting <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> 's response to a <DATE>November</DATE> letter sent byNCAA President <PERSON>Mark Emmert</PERSON> , in which <PERSON>Emmert</PERSON> requested answers to questions " concerning compliance with institutional control and ethics policies . " 
The keymatter for the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> to determine is whether its authority to punish for " lack ofinstitutional control " is as applicable to egregious criminal behavior as it isto providing extra benefits to teenagers.If the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> expands the term 's traditional definition , it could severely punishthe football program and athletic department . 
What happened at <LOCATION>Penn Stateshould</LOCATION> be included under the umbrella.The Freeh report , compiled by a team of investigators led by former <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> directorLouis <ORGANIZATION>Freeh</ORGANIZATION> , ishighly critical of coach <PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> , university president GrahamSpanier , athletic director <PERSON>Tim Curley</PERSON> and vice president <PERSON>Gary Schultz.The</PERSON> four men , according to the report , failed to act despite havingopportunities to confront <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's longtime lead assistant , over 14years . 
They displayed " total disregard " for the children being victimized bySandusky , and <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> - whom <ORGANIZATION>Freeh</ORGANIZATION> repeatedly portrayed as the group 's mostpowerful figure during a news conference <DATE>Thursday</DATE> - lied about what he knew , when he knew it and , according to e-mail correspondence , advised against a planto report one of <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> 's crimes witnessed by an assistant coach.Freeh determined the officials ' incomprehensibly poor decisions stemmed fromtheir desire to avoid negative publicity that could damage the school and theprogram . 
<ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> 's " culture of reverence for the football program " led itsmost senior leaders to put protecting the program ahead of protectingunderprivileged boys , many of whom lacked father figures , from a child rapist.The football-driven culture at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> is so warped that the school 's currentleadership should act to obliterate it without a NCAA mandate . 
It has happenedbefore.Disgraced by its prominent men 's basketball team , <ORGANIZATION>the University of SanFrancisco</ORGANIZATION> canceled the program for three seasons in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> . 
The schoolwas widely applauded for being the first to shut down an out-of-control programin a major sport.Southern <ORGANIZATION>Methodist University</ORGANIZATION> missed an opportunity to join them . 
Throughout the1980s , <ORGANIZATION>SMU</ORGANIZATION> football players were better compensated than many in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> . 
TheNCAA shuttered the program during the <DATE>1987</DATE> and '88 seasons , making it the onlyBowl Subdivision team to get the so-called " death penalty . 
" Because no NCAA bylaws have been violated in the <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> matter , many of theschool 's supporters argue the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> should stay out of it and let the criminaland civil courts hand down justice for the victims . 
That was <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's point ina letter released just this week . 
" This is not a football scandal and should notbe treated as one , " the coach contended.The <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> 's rulebook is heavy-handed . 
There are extensive guidelines prohibitingrecruits from accepting so much as a T-shirt . 
The <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> dictates how much contactcoaches can have with players - and when such interaction is permitted . 
Majorviolations can lead to athletes losing eligibility and teams being banned frompostseason competition.In writing its rules , however , the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> could have no more anticipated the <ORGANIZATION>PennState</ORGANIZATION> scenario than the framers of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Constitution could have envisionedfreedom-of-speech issues related to the Internet . 
That 's why new laws arewritten.Undoubtedly , the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> will discuss how to revise its manual to address theoff-the-field atrocities <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> and others ignored . 
But as <ORGANIZATION>Freeh</ORGANIZATION> correctlypointed out , many of <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> 's crimes occurred in the football team ' sheadquarters close to <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's office . 
They were committed by a man who playeda major role in helping <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> become a national football power.This is actually one of the biggest football issues the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> has ever faced.Paterno is the most important figure in <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> 's transformation from aregional agricultural school into a nationally recognized research institution.The football team 's emergence during his nearly 46 years at the helm drovefundraising efforts and provided the school 's identity . 
The program and theuniversity 's image are linked.With <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> jailed , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> gone and <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> under new direction , somewould suggest there 's nothing for the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> to gain by hitting <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> withany Sandusky-related sanctions , let alone eliminating the football program for aperiod . 
That would hurt only the current coaching staff and players , they say.But virtually all NCAA actions against institutions are handed down after theperpetrators have left town ; the point is to deliver messages to be remembered.The fire that both fueled <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> 's rise and ultimately led to destroying itsimage is still burning . 
It needs to be put out.No one should have to be reminded that protecting children is more importantthan preserving an institution 's reputation . 
But if schools lose sight of that , as <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> so clearly did , then the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> should throw the book at 'em .
