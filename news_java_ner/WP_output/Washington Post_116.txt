" That 's their choice . 
I chose to move on .

Rather than make the 40-minute Metro and car trip home to <LOCATION>Oakton</LOCATION> , he hadarranged to spend the night at the Swann Street townhouse.During the trial , <PERSON>Kathy Wone</PERSON> said , she was most upset by onlookers who thoughtthat her husband went to <PERSON>Swann</PERSON> Street that night because he was living a doublelife and that he was killed during some type of sexual encounter gone wrong .
