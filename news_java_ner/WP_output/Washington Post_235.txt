Maybe he 'll run the place , muses the 21-year-oldWilliams , unless his acting career takes off , which , he thinks , would be evenbetter.She is <PERSON>Anna Robertson</PERSON> -- a product of <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> and the precocious creator of amonthly online magazine at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> calledtheangle.com -- hopeful now that <ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION> is poised upon her graduation <DATE>Sunday</DATE> toask her to join its news desk in New York.Robertson lives in one of the suites on <DATE>U-Va</DATE> . 
's venerated Lawn , part of ThomasJefferson 's original academic village and a location reserved nowadays for 54 ofthe <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> university 's highest-achieving seniors . 
There the digs aresteeped in status , if short on amenities : Occupants must walk outside to findbathrooms . 
<PERSON>Ralph Sampson</PERSON> , the school 's basketball legend , lived there once ; sodid NBC " Today " show anchor <PERSON>Katie Couric</PERSON> , Class of <DATE>' 79</DATE> . 
The ambitious television woman from the Class of '00 has traveled much the samepath as Couric : <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> graduated from <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> 's Yorktown High , the schoolthat nurtured <PERSON>Couric</PERSON> , and , like the TV star , found her way into <DATE>U-Va</DATE> . 
's AmericanStudies program . 
" The joke is I 'm trying to stalk her , " <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> says , sighinga little.Robertson , who created a school newspaper as a fourth-grader , has interned atCBS News , <LOCATION>ABC.com</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>washingtonpost.com</LOCATION> , where she came up with her plan for anonline campus magazine . 
Now affiliated with washingtonpost.com , theangle.comcombines news with interactive discussion , a photo gallery , animation andfirst-person accounts from those at the center of public dilemmas . 
" I just thought that we needed something fresh at the university that reflectedchanges occurring in society , " <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> said of theangle 's <DATE>1998</DATE> inception . 
" Ithought at first that what we 'd get were all tech nerds . 
But the response wasunbelievable . 
" Guided by <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> , who has several volunteer Web designers and 20 writersworking under her , a recent issue of the magazine trained its eyes on a campaignto fight sexual assault on and around campus . 
The rally , dubbed " Take Back theNight , " spurred theangle to produce not only coverage of the event but storiesfrom assault victims and a list of hot lines.Robertson has drawn the attention of university publicists , who distributeglowing news releases about her . 
" We 're looking at the future of journalism " inher , said a statement from senior lecturer <PERSON>William Fishback</PERSON> , who teaches newswriting . 
" <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> has led the way here in using technology to bring in a newgeneration of news readers . 
" While aspiring to make a mark in TV news , <PERSON>Robertson</PERSON> believes that the dramaticchanges in her life are likely the harbingers of other shifts that she ca n'tforesee . 
" It 's hard to be sure what will happen , " she says . 
" I 'm looking towardTV , but the Internet is merging into TV , so everything could be different . . . . Actually , I 'm kind of disillusioned by the way entertainment is taking overnews . 
But I think there 's a way there of doing the news through strong stories . 
" If she needs another one , her classmate <ORGANIZATION>Les Williams</ORGANIZATION> is a good story . 
A discipleof discipline who left <ORGANIZATION>Thomas Jefferson High School</ORGANIZATION> for science and technologywith advanced placement credits in calculus and chemistry , <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> spent hisfirst two years at <LOCATION>U-Va</LOCATION> . 
quietly excelling and building a strong grade-pointaverage in tough engineering courses.It 's paid off . 
This <DATE>spring</DATE> , he received the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Engineering Foundation</ORGANIZATION> ' sOutstanding Student Award , having already been tapped a <ORGANIZATION>Rodman Scholar</ORGANIZATION> in theEngineering <ORGANIZATION>Department</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I had a plan , " <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> says . 
" I told myself I would do very well the first twoyears so that I would feel comfortable branching out and doing other things oncampus the <DATE>last two years</DATE> . 
" And then he makes a happy sound that on paper translates this way : " Yeaaaaahhhhhh . 
" <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> has what Hollywood agents refer to as " presence . " 
He can deliver a linelike " For more , count on Les " and make it sound glibly charming . 
He is astrapping 6-foot-2 , with a broad smile , a firm handshake , a nice touch ofself-deprecating humor , and an inclination toward the unpredictable , absurd andfunny -- especially when probing society 's touchiest subjects.Dismayed by what he regarded as a division over affirmative action and a growingracial self-segregation on campus ( " We have whites over here , blacks over there , and Asian Americans somewhere else , " he says ) , <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> helped organize anannual forum on race titled " Reflection on Complexion . " 
Characteristically , heplays down his efforts : " A friend who was putting it together said he neededsomebody with a crazy sense of humor like me to be one of the moderators of thediscussion , so I said sure . 
That 's me . 
" The fliers advertising the discussion were not sober or genteel or <LOCATION>P.C.</LOCATION> , becausesober and genteel are n't <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> 's style . 
He skirts the lines of tastes . 
So onemorning in <DATE>1998</DATE> , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> students discovered fliers all over campus with deeplyphilosophical questions that ran along these lines : " Why do all white peopledrive Jeep Cherokees ? " 
" Are there any 7-Eleven stores in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> ? " 
" Ebonics : Whatthat is ? 
" The reaction was immediate : " Most people thought it was hysterical , so theycould n't wait to come to the forums , " <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> remembers.Williams shows up at the packed forums wearing his bright orange-and-blue Dr.Seuss hat . 
" Nobody can get too wild when they 're talking to a guy wearing a Dr.Seuss hat , " he observed . 
" It reduces the tension . 
When somebody would startgetting intense , I 'd say , ' If you 're gon na be that way , wear the hat , so you ' lllook less violent . ' 
It 'd get a laugh , and then we could actually get people tounderstand each other a little better . 
" As a tribute to his work , <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> is receiving the university 's <PERSON>Algernon SydneySullivan Award</PERSON> , an honor recognizing " service to humanity and excellence ofcharacter . 
" The service has been nonstop for two years . 
In his junior year , during the sameterm he carried 18 units of courses that included " Fluid Mechanics " and " Elementary Applied Partial Differential Equations , " he co-founded BrothersUnited Celebrating Knowledge and Success ( BUCKS ) , which has led an effort inCharlottesville to assist African American youths . 
Buoyed by aid from cityofficials , <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> and other BUCKS members tutor at computer labs in threelow-income housing complexes.It was the same year <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> learned to live on four hours of sleep a night . 
Heserved as a student adviser to black freshman engineering students . 
He won thepart of Mercutio in a student production of " Romeo and Juliet " that , whileremaining faithful to <ORGANIZATION>Shakespeare</ORGANIZATION> 's dialogue , gave birth to new themes , presenting the feuding families as divided along racial lines , bent on stoppinginterracial dating and preserving their bastions of segregation . 
<ORGANIZATION>CBS News</ORGANIZATION> was sointrigued it sent a film crew to interview <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> and trail him around campus.He breathes the oxygen of a new dream now . 
" I 'm going to find a theater in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> where I can develop my acting , " he says . 
" Acting 's my long-term plan now . 
My job at <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> will pay the bills . " 
He sits ina restaurant , looks up and , as if hearing his words floating in the air , laughsloudly at himself . 
" On the other hand , if it does n't work out , I 'll run <ORGANIZATION>Ford</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Like <PERSON>Anna Robertson</PERSON> , he sees nothing beyond his grasp . 
It is what the old envymost .
