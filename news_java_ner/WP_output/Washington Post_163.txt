" Outlander , " a new TV adaptation of the series of fantasy books by DianaGabaldon , is the story of <PERSON>Claire Randall</PERSON> , a nurse who has recently finishedserving in World War II and is whisked back in time while on a secondhoneymoon in the <LOCATION>Scottish Highlands</LOCATION> . 
There are a lot of fantastical andpleasurable things about the show , which gives Claire a sexy Scottish loveinterest and features lovely , green Scottish landscapes.But one element of the " Outlander " fantasy struck me as particularly resonantfor our times : Even though <PERSON>Claire</PERSON> ( played by <ORGANIZATION>Caitriona Balfe</ORGANIZATION> ) has landed in anera in which the role of women is very different - as are attitudes abouteverything from sexual violence to criminal punishment - when she talks , peoplelisten to her.In one episode , <PERSON>Claire</PERSON> tartly questions the lord who holds her prisoner . 
" Isthere ever a good reason for rape , Master MacKenzie ? " 
she wants to know . 
" I begyour pardon , " the man tells her , chastened , " an unfortunate turn of phrase on mypart . " 
In another , <PERSON>Claire</PERSON> protests to the wife of a local lawgiver when shelearns that a boy who stole a loaf of bread may lose his hand , thereby winninghim a lighter sentence . 
When <PERSON>Claire</PERSON> loses her temper at a tense dinner andmounts a spirited defense of Scottish independence , the British officers she isdining with are temporarily silenced.The right to speak your mind and the expectation that people will listen to , andeven act on , what you say may not seem like an particularly exorbitant luxury.But many of the political struggles women face today involve our continuingstruggle to be heard in a respectful and serious manner.Women can be marginalized even in the very forums that rely on them to sharetheir experiences.Anna , a college student who was sexually assaulted during her freshman year atHobart and <PERSON>William Smith</PERSON> Colleges , told the <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> about thefrustrations of testifying about her experience before the school 's disciplinarypanel : " I felt like I was talking to someone who knew nothing of any sort ofsocial interaction ; what happens at parties ; what happens in sex . " 
Panelistsinterrupted her and each other , changing the subject before she could answer.They asked questions that were intrusive in ways that did not contribute totheir adjudication of the evidence , which in some cases they mischaracterized.Campus disciplinary procedures are meant to give students the opportunity toseek redress for the institution 's failure to keep them safe , ideally incircumstances that are less adversarial than judicial proceedings . 
Too often , experiences such as <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> 's make women wish they had not spoken at all.Then there are the occasions when women speak out but are accused of doing soincorrectly . 
When <PERSON>Rachel Jeantel</PERSON> , the last person to speak to <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> teenagerTrayvon <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> before he was shot to death by <PERSON>George Zimmerman</PERSON> , testified inZimmerman 's murder trial , she was excoriated for her self-presentation , herweight and her tone . 
" Jeantel 's credibility was not the only thing being questioned , " wrote JelaniCobb in the <LOCATION>New Yorker</LOCATION> . 
" Her intelligence was , too . 
" Is it any surprise , then , that women such as <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON>Wendy Davis</PERSON> ( D ) and reproductive rights advocate <PERSON>Sandra Fluke</PERSON> became political celebrities fortheir persistence in speaking their minds , even when facing tremendousobstacles?In <DATE>2013</DATE> , <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> filibustered legislation that proposed new restrictions onabortions . 
For 11 hours , her voice was the barrier holding back the bill , whichultimately passed . 
After Fluke testified before <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in favor of theAffordable Care Act 's mandate that contraception be covered by insurance plans , conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh called her a " slut " and a " prostitute , " unleashing a torrent of virulent attacks on her . 
Fluke was not deterred : She iscurrently running for the state <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in California.Moments like <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> 's filibuster or Fluke 's testimony are electrifying preciselybecause it is so rare for women to be in a position in which we are not simply aparticipant in debates but rather are able to end them by passing laws , givingorders or implementing company-wide strategies and directives . 
Just 20 of the100 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> senators are women , and in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> , 79 of the 435 members are women.The country 's armed services did not have a female four-star general until <DATE>2008</DATE> , when the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> promoted Gen. <PERSON>Ann Dunwoody</PERSON> to that rank . 
Just <PERCENT>4.8 percent</PERCENT> ofFortune 500 chief executives are women.This is why it is such a pleasure to watch <PERSON>Claire Randall</PERSON> back-talk her waythrough 18th-century <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> . 
Even traveling back in time , she has preserved afreedom that , for many women , seems awfully far in the future.Alyssa <PERSON>Rosenberg</PERSON> writes The Post 's Act Four blog at www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/ .
