" <ORGANIZATION>NIST</ORGANIZATION> is a place where I can have animpact and help society , " he said.Biggest challenge : Finding enough time to conduct research and write whileresponding to requests that range from helping the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> with data analysis toassisting domestic and foreign forensic laboratories improve their processes.Quote : " We are helping solve crimes . 
The results from these tests can impactlife and liberty . "
