<LOCATION>RICHMOND</LOCATION> - As a legislator , attorney general and governor , <PERSON>Robert F. McDonnellhas</PERSON> saidhe opposes abortion in all but one instance : if continuing the pregnancywould put the woman 's life in danger.But <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> , a possible vice presidential candidate , recently said through hisspokesman that he would also allow it in cases of rape or incest.The statement has prompted many supporters and opponents to believe that he hasmodified one of his core political stances . 
Some suspect he has done so toimprove his chances of being picked as a running mate for presumed Republicanpresidential nominee <PERSON>Mitt Romney</PERSON> , whose own position on abortion has shiftedover time but makes exceptions for rape , incest and the life of the woman . 
" That shocks me , '' said <PERSON>Olivia Gans</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Society for HumanLife</ORGANIZATION> , which endorsed <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> for governor . 
" I have never heard him make thosecomments . 
It was certainly not his position when he ran for attorney general orgovernor . '' 
But <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Tucker Martin</PERSON> said the governor 's position has notchanged . 
It has been misunderstood , he said , over the past two decades . 
He didnot explain why <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> had not tried harder to correct the record if that wasthe case.Since <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> 's days as a delegate from <LOCATION>Virginia Beach</LOCATION> , countless newsaccounts have reported that he opposes abortion except when the woman 's life isin danger.Martin acknowledged that was how <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> 's position had been reported but saidthose news accounts had been in error . 
Martin pointed to one newspaper articlein <DATE>1996</DATE> , when <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> was a delegate , that mentioned rape and incest inconnection with <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> 's stance . 
It described <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> as someone who " opposes abortions except when the life of the mother is at stake , but from thepublic policy standpoint realizes that exceptions also should be made in thecase of rape or incest . '' 
In a statement issued to <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> <DATE>last month</DATE> in response to criticismfrom Democrats of an abortion bill being debated in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said : " Thegovernor 's position is he is pro-life with exceptions for rape , incest and lifeof the mother . 
" Once one of the most conservative voices in the <LOCATION>Virginia General Assembly</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> has shied away from talking about social issues in recent years.Instead , as the popular governor of a state that could help determine the winnerof the presidential race and the balance of power in the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> , he speaksmostly of jobs and schools . 
He tries to strike a middle ground on policiesfavored by the conservative wing of his party.Political observers say <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> 's inclusion of rape and incest exceptionscould help him on the national stage , allowing him to appeal to conservativeswho oppose abortion rights while picking up the backing of moderates andindependents.A more conservative abortion view might have helped <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> while running forthe legislature or in a Republican primary , said <PERSON>Stephen Farnsworth</PERSON> , a politicalscience professor at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Mary Washington</ORGANIZATION> . 
But it would not be aplus for a GOP vice-presidential nominee or a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> candidate , he added.Most pundits weighing <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> 's vice presidential prospects say the chairmanof the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Governors Association</ORGANIZATION> ' shttp : / / www.google.com/url?q=http://www.rga.org/&sa=U&ei=ZxuMT5y4NsTz0gHNkf3MCQ&ved=0CCUQFjAA&sig2=S-C3aeWCrq9anANiOXQ98A&usg=AFQjCNG9vAy3ZpMgQTgo7nM3WjUpKCf1Qwbiggest negative is that he may be perceived as too socially conservative , http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/veepwatch-part-2-first-do-no-harm-our-vp-contenders/especiallyhttp://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/veepwatch-part-2-first-do-no-harm-our-vp-contenders/http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/veepwatch-part-2-first-do-no-harm-our-vp-contenders/after signing a bill intolaw last month requiring that women undergo an ultrasound before an abortion . 
" The more extreme position McDonnell takes , the more problematic , '' Farnsworthsaid . 
" If you provide you are open to more exceptions , you 're going to increaseyour appeal to moderate voters . '' 
' Extreme positions ' In his 14 years in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Delegates</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> sponsored or co-sponsored35 bills to restrict abortion , although many of them were the same legislationintroduced year after year.He backed a ban on late-term abortions , a requirement that minors receiveparental consent before getting an abortion and a mandated 24-hour waitingperiod for women seeking abortions . 
All three passed the General Assembly.Four years into his legislative tenure , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> represented <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> on theplatform committee at the <ORGANIZATION>Republican National Convention</ORGANIZATION> , the year his partynominated former senator <PERSON>Bob Dole</PERSON> for president . 
The platform in <DATE>1996</DATE> called fora half-dozen constitutional amendments , including a ban on abortion , even incases of rape or incest.In <DATE>1999</DATE> , on a questionnairefrom Project Vote Smart , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> stated thatabortions should be legal when the life of the woman is endangered but not whenthe pregnancy resulted from rape or incest . 
<ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> has declined to answersubsequent <PERSON>surveys.Tarina Keene</PERSON> , executive director of <ORGANIZATION>NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia</ORGANIZATION> , said <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> istrying to change his views after years of being out of the mainstream . 
" Privately , he still holds extreme positions while publicly he is trying toportray himself as someone else , '' she said . 
" You do n't switch your viewpoint onthis overnight . 
These are your core values . 
It 's obvious governor <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> istrying to Etch a Sketch his record . '' 
In his two statewide runs , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> and his staff said he opposed abortion inevery instance except when the woman 's life was in danger.At a <DATE>2008</DATE> speech before the <ORGANIZATION>National Right to Life Committee</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Arlington Countyas</LOCATION> attorney general , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> said that victory in state elections was key toits cause . 
" While you 're on this <LOCATION>Earth</LOCATION> , we need your help at every election . . . . Thosepolicymakers with the votes determine whether or not you 're going to have apro-life state where protections are given to the unborn consistent with federalcourt decisions or whether you 're going to have a different kind of policy . 
" In <DATE>2009</DATE> , when he ran for governor , it was widely reported that <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> ' sposition on abortion allowed only the life-of-the-woman exception . 
That receivedlots of attention , in part because his Democratic opponent , Sen. <PERSON>R. Creigh Deedsof Bath</PERSON> , had a strategy of stressing <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> 's focus on social issues.McDonnell countered that the Democrat was the one fixated on those issues - buthe never disputed Deeds 's characterization of his abortion stance . 
" His message has changed , '' said <PERSON>Kellie McHugh</PERSON> , executive director of Virginiansfor Life . 
" He 's always presented himself as <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> pro-life . 
He 's eitherflip-flopped or not being honest . '' 
' Altered his intensity'After taking office in <DATE>2010</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> surprised supporters and critics alike bylargely governing from the middle . 
He has worked to shore up the state ' seconomy , ease traffic congestion and boost education opportunities , balancinghis centrist persona with his conservative roots.As governor , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> removed most state funding from Planned Parenthood , buthe stopped short of his campaign promise to cut all funds from the nation ' slargest abortion provider . 
After an aggressive lobbying campaign , he insteadproposed a less controversial move that would prevent state money from fundingmost abortions but would maintain it in cases of rape or incest or when the lifeof the woman is at risk . 
<ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> said he brought <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> in line with federallaw and could not cut funds for other services , such as counseling . 
" It 's just troubling , '' said <PERSON>Don Blake</PERSON> , chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia ChristianAlliance</ORGANIZATION> . 
" The sad thing is Bob has alienated two sides of the issue . 
When youwalk in the middle of the road and try to appease both sides , you alienatepeople . '' 
Earlier this year , amid ridicule on national TV and massive protests inRichmond , <ORGANIZATION>McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> stepped in to weaken the ultrasound billhttp : / / www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/virginia-governor-no-longer-fully-supports-ultrasounds-before-abortions/2012/02/21/gIQARIxBSR_story.html?tid=pm_pop he had initiallysupported so that it would no longer require a vaginal ultrasound.McDonnell did not support the so-called personhood bill that would have givenrights to a fertilized egg and had a hand in putting an end to the legislationafter stressing to his new , Republican-majority General Assembly not tooverreach on conservative issues . 
" He 's definitely altered his intensity , " said <LOCATION>Del</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Robert G. Marshall</PERSON> ( R-PrinceWilliam ) , who introduced the personhood bill . 
" He certainly has done that .
