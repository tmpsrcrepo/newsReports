Legendary <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> football coach <PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> said , " I did what I was supposedto . " 
In fact , nobody at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> did what basic human decency requires - andas a result , according to prosecutors , an alleged sexual predator who could havebeen stopped years ago was allowed to continue molesting young boys.The arrest <DATE>Saturday</DATE> of <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky</PERSON> , the school 's former defensivecoordinator , on felony child sex abuse charges , involving at least eightvictims , has sent university officials scrambling to justify a pattern ofself-serving inattention and inaction.University Vice President <PERSON>Gary Schultz</PERSON> and Athletic Director <PERSON>Tim Curley</PERSON> alsoface charges - for failing to report what they knew about <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> and forallegedly perjuring themselves before a grand jury . 
Both proclaim theirinnocence . 
After an emergency meeting of the university <ORGANIZATION>Board of Trustees</ORGANIZATION> , itwas announced <DATE>Sunday</DATE> that the two officials would be stepping away from <ORGANIZATION>theirjobs.Penn State</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Graham Spanier</PERSON> has said that <PERSON>Schultz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Curley</PERSON> have his " unconditional support . " 
If he believes the way they acted was right , or evenremotely acceptable , then he needs to go , too - as does <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> , who can onlydestroy his legacy by hanging on and trying to excuse the inexcusable.Assuming that even half of what <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON>Linda Kellyalleges</PERSON> is true , <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> is a patient and calculating pedophile who used hisinsider status with the glamorous <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> football program to lure boys asyoung as 10 . 
Sandusky allegedly met his victims through the <ORGANIZATION>Second Mile</ORGANIZATION> , acharity he founded that provides programs for troubled - and vulnerable - youth.The investigation that led to the charges was launched in <DATE>2009</DATE> after the motherof a boy - a Second Mile participant - reported allegations of sexual assault toofficials at a high school where <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> , now 67 , volunteered . 
But <PERSON>Penn Stateofficials</PERSON> knew at least <DATE>11 years earlier</DATE> that there were disturbing questionsabout physical contact between <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> and young boys.In <DATE>1998</DATE> , <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> was famous in the college football world as the defensivewizard who gave <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> the nickname " Linebacker U , " and he was oftenmentioned as <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's likely successor.That year , the university police department conducted what a grand jury reportcalls a " lengthy investigation " of allegations that <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> had hugged , rubbedagainst and inappropriately touched two 11-year-old boys while they were nakedwith him in the showers of a <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> locker room.Detectives listened in as the mother of one of the boys called <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> toconfront him . 
According to the grand jury report , <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> told her : " Iunderstand . 
I was wrong . 
I wish I could get forgiveness . 
I know I wo n't get itfrom you . 
I wish I were dead . 
" The local district attorney declined to prosecute , and the investigation wasclosed . 
Paterno was <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> 's immediate boss , and <PERSON>Curley</PERSON> was <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's . 
Perhapsall who were involved did , in the narrowest sense , what they were " supposed to . 
" But imagine how much better it would have been if someone had done the rightthing and taken that <DATE>1998</DATE> incident seriously - better for the victims , but alsobetter for the university 's reputation and ultimately better for Sanduskyhimself.It gets much worse : In <DATE>2002</DATE> , after <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> had retired - although he still hadan office and enjoyed the run of the <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> athletic facilities - a footballteam " graduate assistant " saw <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> raping a young boy in the showers , according to the grand jury report.The assistant - widely identified in news reports as <PERSON>Mike McQueary</PERSON> , a <ORGANIZATION>formerPenn State</ORGANIZATION> quarterback who is now the team 's wide receivers coach and toprecruiter - told <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> what he had seen . 
Paterno told <PERSON>Curley</PERSON> . 
The assistantwas eventually summoned to a meeting with <PERSON>Curley</PERSON> and <PERSON>Schultz</PERSON> at which he says hedescribed the rape in graphic detail.The two officials claim they were only told about behavior that was " not thatserious . " 
They took it seriously enough , however , to decree that <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> couldno longer bring Second Mile children into the football building.But they " never attempted to learn the identity of the child in the shower , " according to the grand jury . 
" No one from the university did so . 
" Unbelievable.According to the grand jury , the assistant , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> , <PERSON>Curley</PERSON> , <PERSON>Schultz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Spanierall</PERSON> knew about the incident . 
Each covered his own behind . 
None lifted a fingerto find out who the alleged victim was or what had become of him.Tell us again : How did you do everything you were supposed to do?The writer will answer questions at <TIME>2 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> at www.washingtonpost.com .
