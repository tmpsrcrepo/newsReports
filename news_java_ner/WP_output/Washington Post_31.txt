Hours before the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> men 's basketball tournament 's first play-in game , threeretired professional athletes walked through the doors of the <ORGANIZATION>National Centerfor Missing</ORGANIZATION> and Exploited Children for the country 's mostimportantsportingevent.One , a Hall of Fame ex-Baltimore <ORGANIZATION>Oriole</ORGANIZATION> , had an idyllic childhood . 
The other twomen , who used to play in the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>NHL</ORGANIZATION> , went through hell , unable to admitfor years the sexual abuse they suffered as kids.Cal <PERSON>Ripken Jr.</PERSON> , <PERSON>Joe Ehrmann</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sheldon Kennedy</PERSON> played different sports . 
Theircareers were as different as their demeanors and speech . 
But their cause wassingular as they grabbed the microphone and spoke to the heads of <ORGANIZATION>Pop Warner</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>USA Swimming</ORGANIZATION> , the Boys and Girls Clubs and 50 other youth organizations . 
" Basically , we 're all committed to make sure more kids do n't suffer , " saidEhrmann , a towering , gruff , white-haired former defensive lineman who played forthe <LOCATION>Baltimore Colts</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Detroit Lions</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> and early <DATE>1980s</DATE> . 
In the coming days , a document intended by its authors to be the " gold standard " for helping prevent childhood sexual abuse will be made available atsafetocompete.org . 
The <ORGANIZATION>Cal Ripken Sr</ORGANIZATION> . 
Foundation and the children 's center thathosted the two-day event in <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION> are urging every youth sportsorganization to adopt a set of guidelines . 
The goal is to enlighten both kidswho play sports and their parents , to empower the bystander who sees somethingwrong and to better expose the sick people who prey on children.The committee that assembled the guidelines benefited from the the input ofpediatricians , law-enforcement officials , advocates for better background checksof coaches and volunteers , and a team of international sports scientists . 
Italso had the personal anecdotes of survivors such as <PERSON>Ehrmann</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> , andthe social conscience of Ripken . 
" After this I think every parent of a youth sports player in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> today oughtto be able to go to any coach and say , ' What 's different since <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> ? 
Whathave you put in place that makes my child safer and better protected ? ' " 
Ehrmannsaid . 
" And I think if we can create that kind of social agitation that wouldreally force a tremendous amount of organizations and coaches to implement it , [ we 've succeeded ] in helping some of those kids . 
" This was a disturbing - but even more necessary - meeting of minds.An <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> survey of incarcerated pedophiles , we were told at <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> 's session , revealed they committed on average 150 acts of molestation . 
Some of theliterature found in the homes of arrested pedophiles included nearly 200-pageguides on how to groom boys for sexual abuse , naming specific coaching andvolunteer jobs in which they had a better chance of not getting caught . 
" Itdoes n't matter how or where you want to find children , but sad and lonelychildren are the children you want to look for , " stated one of the directives , available online to pedophiles . 
There were interviews with convicted childsexual predators about the demented rationalization they use to " help " kidsthrough a rough time.Horrifying but true : People of <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky</PERSON> 's ilk actually network better thansome of the people entrusted to stop them.Ehrmann and <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> 's stories resonated the most because they were about thecure : coming forward . 
They showed a courage that had nothing to do with theshake-it-off , do n't - show-weakness worlds of football and hockey they played in.For decades , <PERSON>Ehrmann</PERSON> , 63 , locked away the image of two men sexually assaultinghim at age 12 . 
But after adult survivors of sexual abuse from <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> 's SecondMile charity came forward to confront their abuser , <PERSON>Ehrmann</PERSON> said , it " re-traumatized me in a very profound way . " 
" I admire , in <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> , the amount of courage that it took for those young mento stand up publicly , to speak out , " he said . 
" It really confronted my own lackof courage that I wish I had revealed so much earlier . 
" Most men do n't report until a minimum of five years . 
It 's very difficult . 
It ' stied into your masculinity . 
It 's tied into your whole self-concept , this conceptof shame that somehow I 'm deeply flawed . 
I 'm unworthy of love , connection . 
Andso what you do is hide that . 
So what I did , as many men do , I built a facade . 
Itrained people to see me as this tough-guy athlete . 
" <LOCATION>Kennedy</LOCATION> , 43 , a former Canadian hockey pro , saw the youth coach who abused himmore than 300 times on television with other kids 17 years ago while <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> wasplaying for the <LOCATION>Calgary</LOCATION> Flames . 
He could n't take it any longer . 
" None of the other adults at the time were doing anything about it , " he said . 
" Iknew I 'd never be the dad I wanted to be unless I dealt with it . 
" <PERSON>Graham James</PERSON> , the coach once celebrated as the <ORGANIZATION>Hockey News</ORGANIZATION> 's " Man of the Year , " was eventually sentenced to five years . 
Kennedy battled cocaine addiction andmany other demons before writing the book " Why I Did n't Say Anything " two yearsago . 
" The shame and the guilt that 's exemplified in sport culture , " he explained . 
" We 've been taught our whole lives to be tough , strong and , you know , neversurrender , and to be able to show weakness , especially to that extreme , is soshaming that people have a hard time with that . 
That 's why we have a lot of kidskilling themselves . 
" Ripken was fortunate to never have the same experience . 
But he and thefoundation named for his late father knew , after what happened at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> , that they wanted to act . 
" It 's a sadness that comes over , " <PERSON>Ripken</PERSON> said . 
" There ' sa victimization that I ca n't fathom . 
You know , kids are very fragile . 
And yourresponsibility as a parent is to bring them along and protect them . 
" After <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> spoke to the full conference room , he stepped away from themicrophone and breathed deeply . 
Then he expressed how important it was that hecame forward . 
He said the fear of being ostracized if he ever told was quicklyput to rest . 
Among the 250,000 letters he received of support afterward , many ofwhich came from men who were sexually abused as boys , was a note from a veteranof the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Army</ORGANIZATION> . 
" He sent me his Purple Heart , " <PERSON>Kennedy</PERSON> said . 
" He wrote , ' You deserve this . '
