The sign announced that the Palace of Gold was ahead , but somewhere along theway , pulling the steering wheel back and forth across the tight <LOCATION>West Virginiaturns</LOCATION> , a visitor might begin to think it was wrong . 
That the promised land ca n'tbe reached . 
Instead he 'll spend eternity driving by one-story homes that doubleas beauty parlors , and hillside cemeteries dotted with bright silk flowers thatnever lose their bloom.Then at the top of the mountain - his hands cramped and heart racing fromanother near-miss with a deer - it unfolds . 
The palace is massive and ornate , with gilded spires cutting into the sky . 
Instantly , it 's evident why this place , about 15 miles southeast of Wheeling , was called <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Taj Mahal</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Welcome to Heaven , " a <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> story proclaimed of New Vrindaban , oncethe nation 's largest <PERSON>Hare Krishna</PERSON> community . 
The palace opened its doors togreat celebration in <DATE>1979</DATE> and became one of <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> 's biggest touristattractions . 
Newspapers , magazines and television raved about the handiwork ofthe devotees who built the magnificent structure in honor of their guru.Then came the scandal , the corruption , the child abuse and murder . 
The betrayalof faith , the fissions of community.New Vrindaban is now often eerily still , the rural silence pierced only by theshrill cry of a peacock . 
In solitude , one might notice that the walls arecrumbling and the paint is peeling . 
The palace is in decay.But change is rumbling through the mountains : New leadership has arrived , as hasa controversial new source of money . 
American Hindus and tourists are once againmaking the pilgrimage to New Vrindaban.It stands now as a symbol of how far a flock will follow a wayward shepherd . 
Butalso how hard some will work to rebuild a place they still believe is holy.THE <PERSON>BEGINNINGSSankirtana Das</PERSON> felt a pull grow stronger as he , his wife and their two youngchildren approached New Vrindaban on a dark <DATE>winter</DATE> night in <DATE>1976</DATE> . 
The communityhad been placed under quarantine because of a hepatitis outbreak , so the29-year-old and his family sneaked in . 
During their first frigid weeks in asmall cabin , they subsisted on mung water , a concoction thought by Vedictradition to have healing properties.Sankirtana , born <PERSON>Andy Fraenkel</PERSON> , was the son of a Jewish father and Lutheranmother . 
He grew up in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> , and studied theater and film at <ORGANIZATION>City Universityof New</ORGANIZATION> York.After seeing the <LOCATION>Hare Krishna</LOCATION> devotees chanting in colorful robes around thecity , he decided to make a short documentary for a school project . 
He wasintrigued by the chant - especially after hearing it on the <PERSON>George Harrisontrack</PERSON> " My Sweet Lord " - so when he and his future wife struck out for a quieterlife in <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION> , they brought along the Bhagavad-Gita , the ancient Hinduscripture , and made their own beads to use when chanting the <PERSON>Hare Krishnamantra</PERSON> . 
" My wife and I both felt a kinship to the meditation , " recalls <LOCATION>Sankirtana</LOCATION> , now65.They gave up marijuana and LSD , and became vegetarians . 
When the money ran out , they headed back to the States , stopping in <LOCATION>Detroit</LOCATION> to hear a talk by thefounder of the <PERSON>Hare Krishna</PERSON> movement , Srila Prabhupada.Prabhupada had sailed to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> on a freight ship in <DATE>1965</DATE> at 70 . 
He carriedwith him <MONEY>$ 8</MONEY> , an umbrella and a command from his spiritual guru to spread to theWest their religious traditions , which shared roots with <LOCATION>Hinduism</LOCATION> but emphasizeda holy repetition of God 's name . 
He chanted in parks and set up a storefrontheadquarters for his sect , the <ORGANIZATION>International Society</ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION>Krishna Consciousness</ORGANIZATION> ( ISKCON ) . 
Prabhupada 's message of material renunciation and spiritual focus resonated withcounterculture types looking for higher meaning . 
Within a few years , he hadinitiated thousands . 
Each new devotee agreed to the four rules : no gambling , nointoxicants , no sex outside of marriage and no eating meat . 
They were to chantfor 90 minutes or more every day and devote themselves to living in service ofGod , or <LOCATION>Krishna</LOCATION> . 
The men shaved their heads , save for a small tail in the back , and everyone donned saffron robes.One of <LOCATION>Prabhupada</LOCATION> 's first initiates was <PERSON>Keith Ham</PERSON> , son of a Baptist minister whowould take the name <PERSON>Kirtanananda Swami</PERSON> , or <PERSON>Swami Bhaktipada</PERSON> . 
In <DATE>1968</DATE> , <PERSON>Kirtanananda</PERSON> acquired farmland in <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> to build a rural <PERSON>Hare Krishnacommunity</PERSON> where devotees could live off the land . 
It was named after <LOCATION>Vrindavan</LOCATION> , a holy city in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> near <LOCATION>Krishna</LOCATION> 's birthplace.By the time <PERSON>Sankirtana</PERSON> and his family arrived , <DATE>eight years later</DATE> , there werenearly 80 devotees living on the mountainside . 
The community 's motto was " Simpleliving , high thinking . " 
Most members lived in small rooms above a barn thathoused milking cows , the grocery store was miles away , and diapers had to bewashed by hand outside.Sankirtana 's job was to cook breakfast and lunch . 
He awoke for a 4:30 a.m.devotional service , followed by chanting and meditation . 
Then he went outside tocook beans and rice over fire pits . 
" It was tough , but we felt like we were pioneers , " <PERSON>Sankirtana</PERSON> recalls . 
" And weowned this project . 
It was a very communal atmosphere . 
You ate your meals at thetemple , and if you needed a toothbrush or toothpaste , everything you needed wassupplied by the temple . 
" By the early <DATE>1970s</DATE> , <PERSON>Kirtanananda</PERSON> had turned his focus to building a house forPrabhupada , with the hope that the aging guru would come to stay and continuehis work of translating ancient Sanskrit texts.The vision for a modest home morphed into an opulent palace . 
Land was cleared onMcCreary 's Ridge , and devotees learned to stain glass and lay bricks . 
Theyimported 52 varieties of onyx and marble for walls and floors . 
They carvedfurniture out of teak , constructed crystal chandeliers , painted elaborate muralson the ceilings and adorned the 10 rooms with jewels.But in <DATE>1977</DATE> , <PERSON>Prabhupada</PERSON> died - the <LOCATION>Krishnas</LOCATION> , who believe in reincarnation , wouldsay he left his body - and plans changed again . 
Now the palace was to be amajestic memorial.Two years later , the Palace of Gold opened to the public . 
A string of flowersthat had hung around <LOCATION>Prabhupada</LOCATION> 's neck at his death marked it as a spiritualtomb ( he is buried in <LOCATION>Vrindavan</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> ) . 
Nearly a thousand devotees came tochant and dance with ecstasy at the weekend-long festival . 
" People always ask , ' Why is it so opulent ? ' " 
Sankirtana says . 
" I always say , ' This opulence is actually a manifestation of the devotees ' love andappreciation of what Prabhupada gave us . ' 
" The palace became an immediate sensation.THE SCANDALBut even as the palace doors opened , the facade of nirvana was beginning tocrack . 
Kirtanananda assumed power at <LOCATION>New Vrindaban</LOCATION> , which by then had 500members , making it the largest and most famous <PERSON>Hare Krishna</PERSON> community in theUnited States.And although Prabhupada intended the community to be a self-sustaining spiritualoasis with seven temples on seven hills , the emphasis on farming and the disdainof material wealth began to slip away . 
Devotees were sent to airports andsporting events to work the crowds for donations - often under false pretenses - and sometimes sold counterfeit goods.The community became heavily male-dominated . 
Women were forced to leave theirchildren in communal nurseries for hours at a time . 
Kirtanananda 's ego grew ashis sway over devotees increased . 
He was a slight man who walked with a limpfrom childhood polio , but he was charismatic and persuasive . 
And he tightlymanaged every aspect of the community : who came , who went , who was doing what atany given moment.Kirtanananda strayed from <LOCATION>Prabhupada</LOCATION> 's teachings by introducing interfaithelements to the prayer services . 
The shifts were deeply divisive , butKirtanananda had little tolerance for dissent.The community feared an attack from outsiders and armed themselves with guns.Allegations of child sexual abuse by <PERSON>Kirtanananda</PERSON> and teachers at the communityschool began to percolate . 
Two devotees who challenged <ORGANIZATION>Kirtanananda</ORGANIZATION> 's authoritywere brutally killed . 
Another devotee , who was convicted of the murders , wouldlater say he acted on the order of Kirtanananda.Kirtanananda himself was attacked by a mentally ill visitor . 
After 10 days in acoma and a month in the hospital , <PERSON>Kirtanananda</PERSON> returned to <LOCATION>New Vrindaban</LOCATION> , andtwo German shepherds were acquired to guard him at all times.Because of his departure from <LOCATION>Prabhupada</LOCATION> 's teachings , ISKCON leadersexcommunicated <PERSON>Kirtanananda</PERSON> and , ultimately , his whole community.After an <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> raid , a federal grand jury charged Kirtanananda with racketeering , mail fraud and conspiracy to murder . 
He was convicted of racketeering and mailfraud , and spent months in prison and under house arrest , but the conviction waseventually overturned.Kirtanananda returned to <LOCATION>New Vrindaban</LOCATION> , but in <DATE>1993</DATE> was caught in a sexual actwith a young male disciple . 
Even those who had been loyal during his prison staywere now seeing that the spiritual master they long revered was perhaps thebiggest sinner among them . 
The feds were sure of it : At a retrial in <DATE>1996</DATE> , <PERSON>Kirtanananda</PERSON> pleaded guilty to mail fraud and got 20 years in prison.He was released in <DATE>2004</DATE> and died in <DATE>October 2011</DATE> at a hospital in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> at 74 . 
THE EFFECTSDonations from Hindu Americans had been a major source of revenue for NewVrindaban , but once news of <LOCATION>Kirtanananda</LOCATION> 's crimes surfaced , they shut theirpocketbooks . 
And without <PERSON>Kirtanananda</PERSON> 's fundraising scams , little money wascoming in . 
Devotees left in droves . 
" I was too stubborn to leave , " <PERSON>Sankirtana</PERSON> recalls . 
" We were saying , ' Well , waita minute . 
This is not <ORGANIZATION>Kirtanananda</ORGANIZATION> 's community . 
This is Prabhupada ' scommunity . ' 
" By the <DATE>late 1990s</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>New Vrindaban</ORGANIZATION> 's population dropped to 225 members . 
The schoolhad fewer than a dozen students . 
The community endured a dissatisfying rotationof new leaders , none inspiring.To stay afloat , New Vrindaban sold off land to members , who built houses . 
To paytheir taxes , some became long-haul truckers ; others took seasonal jobs sellingChristmas gifts at mall kiosks . 
Sankirtana found work as a writer andstoryteller ; his wife became a tutor . 
Life became less communal , but also lessrestrictive.They hung on , and in <DATE>1998</DATE> , ISKCON let the community back into the <LOCATION>Hare Krishnafold</LOCATION> . 
Last year , the devotees got a new leader , someone they felt they couldtrust , someone aloft in spirit and grounded in business savvy.Today , <LOCATION>New Vrindaban</LOCATION> feel something like an abandoned garden . 
There are signs ofneglect and desolation , but also of beauty and new life . 
About 165 devoteesbelong , living either above the temple in an ashram , in a nearby apartmentcomplex or in modest homes that dot the winding road . 
There is still a pastureof 65 cows , though 60 are too old to give milk.New Vrindaban is most alive before <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME> , when several dozen devotees gatherin the temple , remove their shoes , bow to the ground and begin services . 
Whileeven the birds still sleep , the devotees dance and drum and sing before colorfulstatues of their deities.They lay food and flowers at altars , each representing a form or facet of God.To the side sits a wax statue of a cross-legged Prabhupada . 
When there is achill , devotees adjust a covering over his shoulders ; in the heat they turn afan to face him.It is a jubilant scene , illuminated by candlelight and perfumed with incense.After 45 minutes , they will sit with prayer beads and meditate on the names ofGod . 
Then there will be more chanting and a class on scripture . 
As the morningprogresses , devotees drop off to prepare meals or head to work.Devotees who 've chosen a life of celibacy often still wear orange or whiterobes , but most others dress in jeans and flannel shirts , flowing skirts orsaris . 
They manage their own time , and attendance is n't taken at services.Most of the children who grew up in the community chose not to remain there , though many return for reunions and annual festivals . 
But a small stream ofother young people has begun to flow in - devotees from other temples who want aquiet place to raise children or are drawn to living off the land and studyingunder <ORGANIZATION>Prabhupada</ORGANIZATION> 's early disciples.Two other recent developments have reinvigorated the community : the newleadership and new money.THE NEW LEADERTake away the white robes , stocking feet and streak of clay running down hisforehead , and you can almost see the businessman that <PERSON>Jaya Krishna</PERSON> once was.He is sitting at a long table beneath a picture of Prabhupada . 
He is 59 , thoughhe looks a decade younger . 
Until 10 years ago , he was a sales executive at asoftware company in his native Switzerland.But even as his career thrived , he longed for something more . 
" You have yourhouse . 
You have your second car , " he says . 
" But where is happiness coming from?Is this really what life is all about ? 
" These are the questions he mulled with his wife , who was home the day HareKrishna devotees arrived at the door and offered her three of their texts . 
" Youhave to read this book , " <PERSON>Jaya Krishna</PERSON> remembers her saying when he arrived home . 
" This book is for you . 
" Within the year , both his wife and 23-year-old son died in tragic accidents . 
" She was gone . 
And then suddenly I said , ' Oh , there is a book somewhere I haveto read , ' " he recalls.What he read in the Bhagavad-Gita struck a chord . 
He had always grappled withthe question of why some people are born rich , others poor , some healthy , othersdisabled . 
The concepts of reincarnation and karma made sense . 
" And somehow youget this feeling , ' Oh , that 's right , ' " he says . 
" The soul is hankering for thisrelationship with God , and the mantra is reestablishing this relationship . 
" He went to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and was initiated . 
Because of his leadership skills , he wassent to <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> to direct an ISKCON college . 
Last year , he was asked to come toNew Vrindaban.As the community president , <PERSON>Jaya Krishna</PERSON> is not meant to act as New Vrindaban ' sspiritual leader ( each initiated devotee has his or her own guru at varioustemples around the world ) but as its administrative steward.The primary goals for his three-year tenure have been to set up a workingorganizational structure and to lay a plan for <ORGANIZATION>New Vrindaban</ORGANIZATION> 's future . 
But thefirst step , he says , is to help the devotees believe in their community . 
" Based on the history , their trust has been shattered - their faith , " he says . 
" We have such big potential . 
Everybody loves to be here . 
We just have to changeourselves internally so we can believe it . 
" Jaya Krishna breaks from his office work to help serve lunch every day . 
LatelyAmerican Hindus and tourists are once again making the pilgrimage , touring thePalace of Gold and taking pictures at the 25-foot-tall statues of deitiesoverlooking a fish pond . 
" I would like to support the community ... to become prosperous and focused onthe instructions of our founder [ Prabhupada ] . 
That is , protect the cows , educate - everyone , not just the children - and finally , deepen and spread Krishnaconsciousness , " he says.And there has been an influx in money to advance the cause.When <PERSON>Jaya Krishna</PERSON> arrived , there was talk of selling the land 's gas rights.With the temple property , the farmland and the homeowners ' individual plots , NewVrindaban owned about 2,000 acres on the <PERSON>Marcellus Shale</PERSON> , a gas-rich stretch ofearth running from <LOCATION>Tennessee</LOCATION> through <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> to Upstate New York.All around <LOCATION>New Vrindaban</LOCATION> , landowners were selling rights to energy companiesthat brought in drills to tap natural gas . 
But the <ORGANIZATION>New Vrindaban</ORGANIZATION> residents weredeeply divided ; many feared the environmental ramifications . 
Almost 50 residentssigned a protest letter asking ISKCON 's national governing board to stop thenegotiation.But ultimately a board of members voted to sell the rights to <ORGANIZATION>Chevron</ORGANIZATION> , arguingthat the gas from their land would be tapped through nearby drills even if theydid n't make a deal , so they might as well get a cut of the money.A <MONEY>$ 4 million</MONEY> payment was quickly disbursed on renovation : new roofs , restoration of guest cabins , ashram rooms and a lodge restaurant . 
Other paymentswent to a trust holding the community 's agricultural land and to individualhomeowners . 
<ORGANIZATION>Chevron</ORGANIZATION> has not yet tapped the site , but if and when it does , NewVrindaban will see even more revenue.Jaya Krishna is hoping the spruced-up grounds will bring an influx of visitors.The growing popularity of yoga , meditation and <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> spirituality couldposition New Vrindaban as an ideal retreat . 
He envisions expandedaccommodations , educational offerings , shops . 
The community also hopes toacquire more milking cows and revitalize the agricultural program.There is a renewed emphasis on living off the land , and young followersinterested in the local food movement consider the community a mecca . 
" I just love the peacefulness here , " says <PERSON>Estefania Perez</PERSON> del Solar , a25-year-old devotee who arrived last <DATE>summer</DATE> . 
She sees <LOCATION>New Vrindaban</LOCATION> as thepastoral haven Prabhupada intended it to be . 
She was not born when <PERSON>Kirtananandawas</PERSON> banned from the place . 
To her , the history is an interesting footnote , notthe defining truth.Jaya Krishna and <ORGANIZATION>New Vrindaban</ORGANIZATION> 's older devotees hope time will fade the stain ofscandal . 
That their guru 's vision will once again flourish on the <PERSON>mountaintop.Ellen McCarthy</PERSON> is a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post staff writer .
