If t he incoming Republican leadership in the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> isserious about trying to repeal health-care reform , there 's only oneappropriate Democratic response : " Make my day . 
" Just to be clear , there 's no earthly chance that a bill repealing the landmarkhealth-care overhaul could make it through <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and be signed into law . 
Evenif Republicans managed to hold together their new majority in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> , theywould face the inconvenient fact that Democrats still control the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> . 
Andeven if a repeal measure somehow sneaked through the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> , President Obamawould veto the thing faster than you can say " preexisting conditions . 
" So this exercise in tilting at windmills ca n't even be described as quixotic , since that would imply some expectation of success , however delusional . 
Thewhole thing is purely theatrical - and woefully ill-advised . 
Yet Republicans promise to stage a vote on repeal before <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> delivers hisState of the <ORGANIZATION>Union</ORGANIZATION> address , expected late this month . 
" If we pass this bill witha sizable vote , and I think that we will , it will put enormous pressure on theSenate to do perhaps the same thing , " Rep. <PERSON>Fred Upton</PERSON> , who will be chairman ofthe <ORGANIZATION>House Energy and Commerce Committee</ORGANIZATION> , said on " Fox News <DATE>Sunday</DATE> . " 
" But then , after that , we 're going to go after this bill piece by piece . 
" This sounds fine , until you actually look at the pieces . 
Already in effect areparts of the reform package that no self-interested politician is going to voteto take away.No child can be denied insurance coverage because of a preexisting condition.Coverage can no longer be canceled when the policyholder gets sick . 
Insurancecompanies can no longer impose annual or lifetime limits on payments for care.Adult children can remain on their parents ' policies until they turn 26 . 
Policyholders can not be charged extra for seeking urgent care at an emergencyroom that is not in the insurance company 's approved network of providers.Those measures took effect in <DATE>September</DATE> . 
Another set of provisions became law onSaturday : requirements that insurance companies spend a certain percentage ofthe premiums they collect on care ; a discount on prescription drugs for someseniors covered by Medicare ; a rule that gives seniors free screening for cancerand other diseases.Republican leaders are n't dumb enough to explicitly propose taking all thesebenefits away . 
But Democrats can , and should , force them to have that debate.The <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> strategy is to go after the less popular elements of the reform package.These include a requirement that businesses do a lot more paperwork for <ORGANIZATION>the IRS</ORGANIZATION> , a measure allowing federal money to pay for abortions in the case of rape orincest , and the mandate compelling individuals to buy health insurance . 
" We willlook at these individual pieces to see if we ca n't have the thing crumble , " Upton said.But these are fights that Democrats should welcome.The tax-reporting measure , which requires businesses to file a 1099 form withthe <ORGANIZATION>IRS</ORGANIZATION> for every expenditure over <MONEY>$ 600</MONEY> , really has nothing to do with healthcare ; many Democrats are as eager to get rid of it as Republicans . 
As forabortion , the provisions of the reform package are fully in keeping withexisting law - and with public opinion.It seems likely that the constitutionality of the individual mandate willultimately be decided by <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> . 
It takes nothing more than simplearithmetic , however , to calculate that in order to make possible the other partsof the reform package - prohibiting denial of coverage because of preexistingconditions , keeping kids on their parents ' policies , all those goodies - it ' snecessary to bring as many people as possible into the insurance pool.Otherwise , only sick people would buy coverage . 
Rates would inevitablyskyrocket.I suppose you could call it a " tax " or a " user fee " instead , but a debate aboutthe unpopular mandate is really a debate over rescinding the popular,consumer-friendly measures that are already bringing peace of mind to millionsof American families.Maybe the new <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> leadership believes it needs to stage this fight to keep theTea Party types from going rogue . 
Smart Republicans must know , however , thatthey won their public-relations advantage on health-care reform by framing it asa big , amorphous beastly thing labeled " Obama-care . 
" All along , what Democrats really wanted was for Americans to look closely at thedetails . 
Now it looks as if the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> is ready to oblige.Eugene <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> will be online to chat with readers at <TIME>1 p.m.</TIME> Eastern timeTuesday .
