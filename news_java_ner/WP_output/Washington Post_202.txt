Edited questions from <ORGANIZATION>Apartment Life</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Sara Gebhardt</PERSON> 's online discussion aboutrental issues.QWashington : Do you think people should take pictures if there are any damagesbefore they move into an apartment so they do n't get billed for wear and tearwhen they move out?AYes , I think you should take pictures of an apartment upon move-in , even if nodamage exists . 
You can also ask your landlord to do a pre-move-in walk-throughso you can document ( also in writing ) the state of the apartment . 
It will help alot in any disputes that may arise later regarding your security deposit.King of <LOCATION>Prussia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION> : Do you know if neighbors have the right to slip notesunderneath your door complaining about food smells ? 
Is this legal ? 
I considerthis harassment.I am not a lawyer , but I do n't think slipping a piece of paper under your dooris illegal . 
Harassment would mean papers all the time , etc . 
Before you consult alawyer , my advice is to have a conversation with the neighbors who are doingthis.Washington : We 've killed three mice in the past two weeks ( five since movingin ) . 
Each time we complain to the building management , they apologize and justgive us more mousetraps . 
At what point is this negligence on their part ? 
Canthey just keep giving out mousetraps and not address the problem?I bet they think they are addressing the problem by giving you mousetraps.However , they do have a responsibility to help you get rid of the problem , whichmay mean hiring professionals to do some extermination . 
You should first askthem to do this before you conclude they are negligent . 
In the meantime , you canbe vigilant by keeping your place very clean and by plugging any holes in yourwalls with steel wool . 
If the problem persists and your landlord isunresponsive , you can report your landlord to the health department.Manhattan : <DATE>Last night</DATE> , there was a note from management under my door . 
They willbe cleaning the facade of our 35-floor building for the next five weeks and saidthat we can not open our windows or use our terraces during that entire time ! 
Ipay a higher rent in the building because I wanted one of the apartments with aterrace . 
Now they are saying I ca n't use it . 
I am so annoyed . 
The building isgoing condo so I do n't think the tenant management cares too much aboutinconveniencing us because they are n't renewing leases . 
I am thinking of askingfor a reduction on next month 's rent . 
Am I out of line?Ask for a rent reduction . 
Good property managers do reduce rent for majorconstruction or building overhauling , and this cleaning project seems toconstitute that.Sara <PERSON>Gebhardt</PERSON> 's Apartment Life column appears biweekly in this section , and herWeb chat appears monthly on www.washingtonpost.com .
