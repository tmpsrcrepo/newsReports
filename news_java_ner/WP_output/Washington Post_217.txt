Dear Ms. <PERSON>Hax</PERSON> : I have lived in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> for six years , and have dated women in their latetwenties to mid-thirties . 
When I explain that I manage my own investments , theireyes light up and their further inquiry presents embarrassingly familiarinterest in my financial prospects . 
They seem convinced that I am wealthy ; I amquite certainly not . 
One such date , when I mentioned playing my piano , actuallywanted to know how much the instrument was worth.Coming from <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> , I had always heard of the materialistic inclination of thewomen hereabout , but had supposed this an exaggerated stereotype . 
Experience hasconfirmed the observation beyond my misgivings . 
How does one cope ? 
-- <PERSON>Ye Olde BefuddledHey</PERSON> , are n't you that guy from " The Avengers " ? 
If there were anything I could do to break <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> of its raging cash habit , Iwould do it in a second.And I 'd make a killing.But as long as money can turn any old Sneetch into a Star-Bellied Sneetch , we " classless " Americans will persist in our ungainly grab for dollars . 
Not allYanks are quite so spiritually bankrupt , of course ; if someone professes arespect for value-values over dollar-values , very little fainting occurs.And , mercifully , we 're not all so obvious.But unless you 're willing to befriend a bunch of poets and then steal theirgirlfriends , there 's no systematic way to locate women who ca n't be bought.Better just to weed out the greedies by :1 . 
Fishing in less materialistic ponds . 
If " trendy , " " chichi " or " hip " are everused to describe your hangouts , you 're bound to reel in climbers .2 . 
Describing your profession , straight-faced , as watching yourself lose vastquantities of money instead of watching a high-paid broker lose it for you .3 . 
Being your humble self . 
If you attract nothing but climbers , it 's time tocheck your bait -- clothes , cars , conversation topics , everything.For the piano lady , though , I 'd bring on the special treatment . 
Call her again , go on an outrageously sumptuous date and , at every opportunity , flog yourimaginary worth : " What , the Steinway ? 
In the family for ages . . . . " And then never call her again.Dear Carolyn : I am 28 and have been dating a wonderful 25-year-old for the past two years . 
Sheis my confidante , soul mate and best friend . 
For the first year , we enjoyed acomfortable level of intimacy . 
For the last year , our sex life has dropped offto zero . 
She confided that she was the victim of sexual abuse as a child anddate-raped in college . 
At my urging , she has been seeing a therapist for thepast eight months to try to sort things out . 
She does n't believe she 'll everdevelop a sexual appetite again . 
My parents keep telling me that intimacy is anormal and important aspect of a marriage and I should n't propose until " thingsin the bedroom improve . " 
I think this is callous , but maybe they have a point . 
-- ConfusedYou say callous like it 's a bad thing.Not that you should ditch the poor creature -- she needs time and support to getbetter , and if you love her , you 'll give her both . 
But when you 're talking abouta lifetime commitment , there is absolutely nothing wrong with waiting to seewhat , exactly , you 're committing to . 
Can you promise to stay in love ? 
No . 
Retirerich ? 
No . 
Resist cancer ? 
Nope . 
Guarantees in marriage are notoriously hard tocome by . 
That 's why you should never , ever take lightly what you already knowfor a fact.Right now , you know sex is a problem . 
Actually , " intimacy " is the betterword -- the physical act is only part of her burden . 
Unless you 're prepared , without hesitation , to make that problem a permanent part of your life , you ' renot ready to propose . 
And , frankly , I doubt that eight months into a difficultprocess is a smart time for her to make one of the weightier choices she ' llface.The abuse and the rape will never go away -- there 's no point watching the clockfor that one . 
But with good care and willpower , your girlfriend can learn tominimize their hold over her . 
She might not , though . 
That 's why it 's sofortunate that the decent thing -- to give her enough unpressured time to find outeither way -- is also the wise one.Hey Carolyn : Going on a first date tonight with a guy I 'm very interested in . 
For somereason , I do n't do very well on first dates . 
I want to make a great impressionand leave him wanting more . 
Any suggestions ? 
-- <LOCATION>Newport</LOCATION> , R.I.Run through the external checklist : Bathe , floss , brush , dress like you are n'tdesperate , resist the urge to apply enough perfume to fell a wild beast.Then , the internal : Want him to impress you.Reversing that part is a classic mistake . 
You become so self-conscious trying towin the Big Contest that you never bother to see if you even want the prize.Listen . 
Ask questions . 
Find out.And do n't eat like it 's your first trip out of the barn.Write to Tell Me About It , Style Plus , <DATE>1150</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>15th St. NW</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> 20071or tellmewashpost.com .
