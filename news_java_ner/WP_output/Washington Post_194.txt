Dear Carolyn : Back in grade 10 , my best friend was a girl named <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON> . 
We slept over at eachother 's houses , stayed for family meals , the whole nine yards . 
Then we got intoa big fight . 
She started threatening me and getting her friends to threaten meas well ; the harassment got so bad , my parents considered pulling me out of thatschool.Six years later , she calls me up and apologizes for being a bitch . 
I figured I ' dlet her say her piece and give it a shot ; I knew that , if I were in her place , Iwould n't have the courage to call my former friend . 
When we met for lunch , itwas great . 
We fell back into our old groove and everything was fine.BUT ... I still remember everything she did to hurt me . 
She wants everything tobe the way it was again , but I 'm not ready for that yet . 
When I do n't return hercalls within a day , she leaves whiny messages on my machine asking if I 'm mad ather . 
She 's already making plans for parties for us to go to and what she ' sgetting me for Christmas and so on . 
What should I do ? 
-- P.Try Lisa-repellent ? 
Hungry Dobermans ? 
A moat?Plenty of sub-model behavior occurs in the grade-school years , but that usuallymeans copying an outfit , telling a fib or two and the occasional round ofbackstabbing . 
Threats and harassment , not to mention thug recruitment to furthersame , clearly earn themselves a special spot in the pantheon of youthfulindiscretion.That , in turn , means <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON> earns herself a special spot among the youthfullyindiscreet . 
The sociopath spot . 
To torment someone that maliciously and to thatextent , she had to have started from a more troubled -- and troubling -- emotionalstate than your average struggling sophomore.While six years can do a lot to tame an adolescent beast , years alone are n'tenough to wrangle a head case into a model citizen-friend . 
In fact , you shouldassume they were n't enough -- unless she demonstrated to you a clear understandingof how egregious her behavior was by making her apology fit the crime . 
And I ' msorry , " bitch " alone does n't cut it.Unfortunately , all signs say <PERSON>Lisa</PERSON> is just a head case mellowed ( somewhat ) byage . 
Her full-bore friendship renewal bears a striking , if deceptively morejolly , resemblance to her full-bore rejection of you back in 10th grade . 
Thinkabout it : Is it all or nothing with her ? 
Yup . 
Is she calling the shots ? 
Yup . 
Areyou letting her call them , even when they conflict with your own interests?Ayup.I 'm not saying you should repel her completely . 
You had that great lunch andall , and old friends , even the screaming nut jobs , should be prized forendurance alone . 
But do n't settle for " older " without the " wiser " clauseattached . 
Know ahead of time that she has rather innovative ways of enforcingher will on you , and that you cave at your peril . 
Hang in.Carolyn : I think you were wrong in your answer [ <DATE>Nov. 19</DATE> ] to " Anonymous , " who felt she hadbeen raped . 
True , flirting is not consent and dating is not consent , but goingto a motel is consent in any language . 
-- DonUh , except hers , right ? 
And define " stop " for me , please , in English . 
Bonuspoints if you can nail " no " on the first try.The problem here is , the language you 're speaking is n't English , it 's MindlessPresumptuous Thug.Unfortunately , my in-box tells me you 're just one of way , way too many peoplewho speak it . 
All of you , please , get your heads out of your pants and read : Even if there had been consent at some point -- implied , stated , societal , faxed -- it was clearly withdrawn , and once it was , I do n't care if they werenaked , oiled , playing " Bolero " and lying on a heart-shaped bed in an hourly-ratemotel : Intercourse from that point on was rape.Besides , if you honestly believe the proper result of leading a guy on -- ornaivete or poor judgment or eagerness to be loved or whatever it was that puther in that motel room -- is painful , unwanted sex , I do n't want to live on yourplanet , much less speak its native tongue.I 'm going to let a particularly insightful reader finish this answer to you : " [ W ] e have all made bad decisions in our lives , and I am guessing some peoplewalk away feeling pretty smug that nothing happened to them . 
But the harshreality is that some people get nastier ' learning experiences ' than others . 
Andpeople who feel the need to place blame need to examine their own issuessurrounding loss of control . 
They can act like it would never happen to them allthey want to , until ( God forbid ) it happens to them . "
