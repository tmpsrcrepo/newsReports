They are a small society , bound by tragedy.When a child goes missing , few people can fathom the awful wait , the filling inof blanks , the nightmares . 
There are n't many who can relate to the horror thatHannah <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> 's family is living now.The Harringtons can , and they reached out to offer companionship - if notcomfort , because there is no such thing as comfort here - to the parents of <ORGANIZATION>the18-year-old University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> sophomore who vanished <DATE>Sept. 13</DATE> . 
" There are no Hallmark cards for missing . 
Missing is tough , " said <PERSON>GilHarrington</PERSON> , who spent three horrific months in " missing " hell only to have itreplaced with something different - a new pain - once the body of her20-year-old daughter , <PERSON>Morgan Harrington</PERSON> , was found in a <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> field fiveyears ago.The Harringtons , who exist in a constant state of mourning , mending , advocatingand wondering , immediately recognized their own anguish when they saw theGrahams on television , pleading for the public 's help in finding their daughter . 
" You look at their faces and see the broken look . 
You know that look , thatfeeling , " said <PERSON>Gil Harrington</PERSON> , who runs a foundation called Help Save the <ORGANIZATION>NextGirl</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I remember what it was like when it was one week old . 
When it was twoweeks old . 
" Then they learned that their ties could be deeper than a shared emotion , ashared experience.Graham , who 'd been out with friends , was last seen with <PERSON>Jesse L.</PERSON> " L.J. " MatthewJr . 
near a <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> restaurant . 
Police arrested <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> , 32 , in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> andcharged him with kidnapping with intent to defile . 
And then they acknowledgedthat his arrest provided a forensic link to <PERSON>Harrington</PERSON> 's death . 
Harrington was astudent at <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Tech</ORGANIZATION> when she left a Metallica concert at <LOCATION>U-Va</LOCATION> . 
on <DATE>Oct. 17,2009</DATE> . 
She was found dead three months later.Matthew has not been charged in connection with her death , but the informationhas the Harringtons reliving all of it.When the <PERSON>Harringtons</PERSON> ' daughter disappeared , the mother of <PERSON>Chandra Levy</PERSON> , aWashington intern who was missing for a year before her remains were found inRock Creek Park in <DATE>2002</DATE> , reached out to them . 
Last <DATE>summer</DATE> , the Harringtons didthe same for the family of <PERSON>Alexis Murphy</PERSON> , who was 17 when she was last seen at agas station near <LOCATION>Lynchburg</LOCATION> . 
Her body has not been found , but <PERSON>Randy Taylor</PERSON> , 49 , was convicted of murdering her.All these families understand one another in a way the rest of the world simplyca n't . 
" I think that great tragedy catapults you from your great differences toyour shared humanity , " <PERSON>Gil Harrington</PERSON> said . 
She tries to stay focused on campussafety for women , especially during the first few months of school , when herdaughter and <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> disappeared , when students newly on their own are off-kilterand vulnerable.We now know that <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> was accused of sexual assault at two colleges , in <DATE>2002and 2003</DATE> . 
Both times , at <ORGANIZATION>Liberty University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Lynchburg</LOCATION> and then at <ORGANIZATION>ChristopherNewport University</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>Newport News</ORGANIZATION> , police investigated , but neither incidentled to a criminal case.The alleged <DATE>2002</DATE> rape at Liberty was on <DATE>Oct. 17</DATE> , the same date Harrington waslast seen alive . 
The <PERSON>Christopher Newport</PERSON> case was in <DATE>September</DATE> , the same monthas <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> 's disappearance . 
Police also said they have DNA evidence linkingHarrington 's death with the abduction and rape of a 26-year-old woman whoescaped from her kidnapper in <LOCATION>Northern Virginia</LOCATION> on <DATE>Sept. 24 , 2005</DATE> . 
If this is all the work of one person , he could be a back-to-school killer , GilHarrington said.The <PERSON>Graham</PERSON> case brings into sharper focus the crisis of sexual assault atAmerican colleges . 
Too often , the same person is accused of assault multipletimes . 
And if a predator moves around , it can be hard to track him.For the Harringtons , the work of their foundation feels more crucial than ever.Their mission will be to try to save the next girl - after Hannah.petula.dvorak@washpost.comTwitter: @petulad Ã¯ ...
