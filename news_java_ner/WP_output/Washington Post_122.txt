Dealing with unwanted personal comments in the office can be dicey because oneperson 's welcomed compliment can be deemed harassment by another.QI work at a very relaxed research facility in a small community . 
Part of itscharm is that the people are friendly , ask about family , and it 's very " non-corporate . " 
My problem is that an older man at work -- I am in mymid-twenties and he is in his forties -- keeps complimenting me about how I lookand how I smell . 
I find it inappropriate . 
Many of the women close to his agewelcome his compliments . 
Once he prefaced a compliment by saying , " You 're notgoing to get me with harassment , are you ? " 
He laughed , then commented how good Ismelled and was very flirty with his tone . 
He 's never tried anything , and theseincidents have occurred perhaps a dozen times in three years.I am usually very assertive , but this is a very laid-back workplace . 
How do Ihandle this the next time he says something ? 
I do n't want to be seen as a " problem employee . 
" ARebecca <PERSON>Hastings</PERSON> , who answers employment questions for the Society for <ORGANIZATION>HumanResource Management</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION> , said the key thing to remember in situationslike this is that " harassment is in the eye of the beholder " and that justbecause some women may not be offended by this co-worker 's comments does notmean that all women appreciate them.Hastings said that the next time this occurs , the woman " can gently let the guyknow how she feels . . . . She can say , ' Remember when you asked if your commentswere harassment ? 
Well , I 'd hate for it to get to that , but sometimes the way youtalk to me makes me uncomfortable . ' 
That way you 've put him on notice with anhonest , sincere statement , " she said . 
" There 's a right way and a wrong way toget a point across . 
" <PERSON>Hastings</PERSON> said that if the man persists , she then can " gently remind him thatwe 're not going to make such comments " and that if it occurs beyond that " to bemore firm . 
Women are not there to be visual attractions . 
They 're there to work . "
