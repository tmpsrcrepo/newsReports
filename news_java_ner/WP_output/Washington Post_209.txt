Dear Carolyn : I have been with my SO for almost five years , love him dearly , talk aboutgetting engaged pretty regularly . 
It has n't happened yet , though , and I knowwhy : We do n't have sex very often . 
My libido is just , well , not very active . 
Heis frustrated , understandably , and I feel guilty , which makes me even lessturned on . 
It is becoming a huge problem ( and is part of the reason my firstrelationship broke off ) . 
I think the lack of full commitment may be part of theproblem for me , but is that just an excuse ? 
If I love him , but rarely want tomake love to him , do we have a future together ? 
What can I do to find my libido?WashingtonEasy . 
Either you 're with a guy you never really found all that attractive , oryou used to be attracted to him but you lost respect for him/feel taken forgranted by him/are otherwise fuming at him.Or you have a medical problem.Or a pharmaceutical one.Or you 're stressed.Or you 've never had an orgasm and ca n't understand what the fuss was about.Or you suffered childhood sexual abuse.Or feel too insecure to let go.Or you 've neglected your physical self.When they can put an affordable , all-inclusive , luxury vacation with asupportive , committed , sexually skilled partner in a pill , we 'll have our femaleViagra.Any one of a number of broken connections could explain your starving libido , which makes you your best diagnostician . 
Get a physical -- explain to yourdoctor why you 're there -- and , if you 're on any medication , ask about sexualside effects . 
If all 's clear physically , then ask yourself if you are feelingemotionally compromised in any significant way.It may seem like a broad question , but break it down into specific emotions -- anger , fear , stress -- and they become easy boxes to check . 
Every " yes " is atalk with your boyfriend and/or a competent therapist.If the answers are " no " all around , finding your libido could just be a matterof finding your body again . 
And lucky , lucky you , because all problems shouldhave as their solution : leisurely meals , fresh ingredients , a glass of wine , deep breaths , long walks , dancing , working up a sweat , dressing a little moreboldly , adding an inch ( or three ) to your heels , splurging on lingerie , grabbingyour boyfriend 's hand as you walk through the frozen-food aisle.You are woman , remember ? 
Better yet : You are woman . 
Remember.Dear Carolyn : I kept my name when I got married . 
I know that my in-laws - -- especially mymother - and father-in-law , along with my brother - and sister-in-law - -- disapproved . 
My problem is that when they send things to my husband and me , theyaddress them to us as if my last name is my husband 's ( and theirs ) . 
I find thiscompletely disrespectful . 
They know what my name is and that I did not changeit . 
What do you think is the best way to handle this and/or say this to them?Name GameIgnore them . 
Yes , they are being completely disrespectful , not to mention petty.But if this is their idea of a victory , imagine how petty you 'll feel if youeven bother to wrest it from them.Write to Tell Me About It , Style , <DATE>1150</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>15th St. NW</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> 20071 , ortellme@washpost.com, and join <PERSON>Carolyn</PERSON> 's live discussion at noon <DATE>Fridays</DATE> at www.washingtonpost.com/liveonline .
