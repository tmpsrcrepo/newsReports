" For the first time our competence and character are being evaluated by expertsand pundits while we fight . 
" That was Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. <PERSON>Martin Dempsey</PERSON> speaking frankly tofield-grade officers graduating <DATE>June 13</DATE> from <ORGANIZATION>National Defense University</ORGANIZATION> ( NDU ) about what he called " this time of turmoil " when the military is " working hardto adapt to uncertainty and rapidly changing geopolitical , budgetary andcultural landscapes . 
" President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> said last week that he plans to reappoint <PERSON>Dempsey</PERSON> for anothertwo-year term . 
That makes it worthwhile to take another look at this career Armyofficer who likes to quote <PERSON>Yeats</PERSON> , is a straight talker on tough issues - including to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> - and enjoys singing in public , as he did Memorial Dayweekend with a silly song about unicorns for hundreds of children whose fathersor mothers had died in combat.A <DATE>1974</DATE> West Point graduate and an armored cavalry officer who commanded forcesin <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Dempsey</PERSON> has a master 's degree in English from <ORGANIZATION>DukeUniversity</ORGANIZATION> . 
He taught English at <LOCATION>West Point</LOCATION> , fought in Operation Desert Storm , was a special assistant to <ORGANIZATION>Joint Chiefs</ORGANIZATION> Chairman Gen. <PERSON>Hugh Shelton</PERSON> , and for twoyears trained and advised the <ORGANIZATION>Saudi Arabian</ORGANIZATION> national guard . 
He did the samerecently for <ORGANIZATION>Iraq</ORGANIZATION> 's army and other security forces.Four appearances during the past five weeks give some insights into <PERSON>Dempsey</PERSON> ' scharacter.At the <ORGANIZATION>NDU</ORGANIZATION> event , he raised questions for the military : " Winning our nation ' swars is no longer enough . 
How we win is becoming as important as the fact thatwe win , " <PERSON>Dempsey</PERSON> said . 
He did n't mention torture , killing innocent civilians , corruption in contracting or even sexual harassment of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> service personnel.He did n't have to ; it 's on everyone 's mind.Dempsey recalled a <DATE>1991</DATE> talk when Gen. <PERSON>Norman Schwarzkopf</PERSON> told <LOCATION>West Pointcadets</LOCATION> , " I wish I could say that our profession of arms has always exuded highcharacter and competence , but it has n't . 
" Dempsey not so subtly drew a parallel between the past and Iraq/Afghanistan , saying , " As with <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> , negative impressions about our character eclipsed thecourage and sacrifices of many of the men and women who served honorably . " 
Headded , " As we emerge from more than 10 years of war , we 've got some rebuildingto do , " which <PERSON>Dempsey</PERSON> compared to <PERSON>Yeats</PERSON> 's famous quote about " the strugglebetween the swordsman and the saint . 
" A day earlier , on <DATE>June 12</DATE> , <PERSON>Dempsey</PERSON> appeared with <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Chuck Hagelin</PERSON> sessions with the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> budget committees.Senate Republicans brought up <LOCATION>Benghazi</LOCATION> , the attacks last <DATE>Sept. 11</DATE> against a U.S.consulate and <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> annex building in <LOCATION>Libya</LOCATION> that left four Americans dead , including <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON>J. Christopher Stevens</PERSON> . 
Some <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> legislators have keptthe issue alive hoping to use it politically against the <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> administrationand/or as a failure of then-Secretary of State <PERSON>Hillary Rodham Clinton</PERSON> should sherun for president in <DATE>2016</DATE> . 
Sen. <PERSON>Ronald H. Johnson</PERSON> ( R-Wis . ) 
mentioned the testimony of a " whistleblower " whosaid that a special forces rapid response unit could have been on the scenewithin four to six hours after the first attack.Dempsey said , " I would not agree to that timeline . 
The travel time alone [ fromwhere the unit was in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> ] would have been more than that and that 's if theywere sitting on the tarmac . 
" Rep. <PERSON>Tom McClintock</PERSON> ( R-Calif . ) 
challenged what he called too-constrained rulesof engagement in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> . 
" We 're not allowed to pursue insurgents into amosque " he told <PERSON>Dempsey</PERSON> , adding that a World War II veteran told him that if aGerman had run into a church , " We would have blown up the church . 
" Dempsey : " Despite what the veteran told you from World War II , it 's never beenthe tradition in our country to use force indiscriminately . . . . Some of whatyou 're referring to , I 've seen myself . . . a good bit of it is misinformation . 
" Rep. <PERSON>Vicky Hartzler</PERSON> ( R-Mo . ) 
asked about a report by Sen. <PERSON>Tom Coburn</PERSON> ( R-Okla . ) 
listing odd <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> research projects that she called " waste . 
" <PERSON>Dempsey</PERSON> had n't seen it , but said , " I 'll be interested to see whether we put itin there or somebody else put it in there when it became part of the bill . 
" That drew laughter from the audience because lawmakers have often pushed suchprojects on behalf of constituents.Last <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at a <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> news conference with <PERSON>Hagel</PERSON> , <PERSON>Dempsey</PERSON> explained hisposition on <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> , which has drawn criticism on Capitol Hill.Regarding a no-fly zone , he said , " My concern has been that ensuring thatSyria 's airplanes do n't fly addresses about <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of the problem in termsof the casualties that are taken in <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> . 
And if we choose to conduct a no-flyzone , it 's essentially an act of war , and I 'd like to understand the plan tomake peace before we start a war . 
" A less-public side of <PERSON>Dempsey</PERSON> was on display <DATE>May 24</DATE> when he spoke to familieswho had lost loved ones over the <DATE>past 12 years</DATE> - part of the <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> ofAmericans who have borne <PERCENT>100 percent</PERCENT> of the burden of the fighting.A young boy asked , " Why did you join the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> ? " 
" I thought it stood for the right things , " <PERSON>Dempsey</PERSON> said . 
" That it would allow meto be around people who knew that there was something more important in lifethan just making money and having a job , who might actually some day have toprotect this country . 
Which by the way is exactly why your moms and dads joinedthe <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> and in the case of some . . . gave their lives . 
" He told the adults , " It must be something extraordinary for you to listen to thenational anthem , because no one has had the experience of being handed a foldedflag . 
You have . 
" And those of us who have n't experienced that do n't know , really , what that - <ORGANIZATION>Ica</ORGANIZATION> n't even conceive of what it must be like .
