<LOCATION>WILLIAMSBURG</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> - <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Republicans are cloistered at a tony golf resort herefor three days hoping to resurrect their battered political brand , as theyprepare for what could be another damaging confrontation with President <PERSON>Obamaover</PERSON> federal spending.At their annual retreat , <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> members said there is general fretting about thedamage done to the party 's image by the strident tone adopted by some candidatesand officials . 
" It 's a time for self-reflection , " said one member , who spoke on the conditionof anonymity to share details of the private discussions . 
" Our identity with theAmerican people has really , really suffered , and this is a conversation aboutcollectively restoring a values-driven identity . 
" Although there was some urgency for a change , the consensus was that the changewas about how to communicate , not about rethinking core policy positions . 
" This is about tone . 
It 's about messaging and it 's about showing people whatwe 're for instead of what we 're against , " said <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Robert F. McDonnell</PERSON> ( R ) , describing his message to <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Republicans at a lunch-time sessionThursday . 
" Rape is a four-letter word - do n't say it , " the group was advised by aRepublican pollster in another session , said one person familiar with thediscussion . 
That was a reference to controversies about rape and abortion thatwere partly to blame for the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> losing two <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> seats - in <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> andMissouri - in November.Sessions this week included advice on turning around troubled organizations fromthe chief executive of <ORGANIZATION>Domino</ORGANIZATION> 's Pizza and a motivational address from the firstblind man to summit <LOCATION>Mount Everest</LOCATION> . 
But much of the retreat was devoted to whatamounted to open-mic sessions to let members strategize for the upcoming fiscalfight.The nation has reached its <MONEY>$ 16.4 trillion</MONEY> credit limit and without congressionalaction , the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION> has said the government will be unable to meetits spending obligations sometime in <DATE>February</DATE> or early <DATE>March</DATE> . 
Many Republicanswant to use the moment to extract deep spending cuts from <LOCATION>Obama</LOCATION> , including inentitlement programs.The president says that without increased borrowing authority , the nation willdefault on its debt obligations and send the world 's economy into a tailspin.One possible course , aides said , would involve raising the debt ceiling for justa few months in exchange for <MONEY>several hundred billion dollars</MONEY> in budget cuts , probably culled from a bipartisan list developed in <DATE>2011</DATE> in talks led by <ORGANIZATION>HouseMajority</ORGANIZATION> Leader <PERSON>Eric Cantor</PERSON> ( R-Va . ) 
and Vice President Biden.A longer-term debt-limit increase would be available thereafter , but only if <ORGANIZATION>theRepublican-led House</ORGANIZATION> and the Democratic-led <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> approved a framework to settax and spending policies for the next decade.That would avoid a federal default and move the negotiation to areas in whichthe president seems more amenable and have less impact on the broader economy : the automatic spending cuts to military and domestic programs set to hit inearly <DATE>March</DATE> and the expiration on <DATE>March 27</DATE> of a funding bill to keep thegovernment running . 
" If we 're willing to do it , we want something in return , " said Rep. <PERSON>John Fleming</PERSON> ( R-La . ) 
, one of the chamber 's most fiscally conservative members . 
" Ourconstituents are going to demand that . 
Even if it 's short-term , what are wegetting for that ? 
" House Budget Chairman <PERSON>Paul Ryan</PERSON> ( R-Wis . ) 
said the goal is to use this moment toreduce deficits , while recognizing that Republicans are limited by the fact thatthey do not control the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> . 
" We think the worst thing for the economy is to move past these events that areoccurring with no progress made on the debt and the deficit , " <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON> said , offering his most expansive exchange with reporters since his unsuccessful vicepresidential bid . 
Aides said <PERSON>Ryan</PERSON> is reassuming his role as the <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> 's front manon budget issues.The House Republicans ' retreat follows a particularly rocky period for thempolitically : The <DATE>November</DATE> election went poorly . 
Besides <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's defeat of <ORGANIZATION>MittRomney</ORGANIZATION> , Democrats enlarged their <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> majority and picked up eight seats inthe House.Lawmakers and staff members attending the retreat described the discussions aspassionate and intense , but not angry . 
" I think this is a time where now you can catch your breath a little , " said Rep.Greg <PERSON>Walden</PERSON> ( R-Ore . ) 
, noting that the gathering comes just two months afterElection Day and after weeks of intense wrangling over the " fiscal cliff " andthe start of a new Congress.The retreat will continue into <DATE>Friday</DATE> . 
One senior aide said that as of <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , the conversation was dominated by the fiscal debate . 
Members only brieflydiscussed gun control , a topic that <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> indicated this week will be a coreplank of his second-term agenda . 
On that issue , <PERSON>Boehner</PERSON> told members privatelywhat he has been saying publicly : The <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> will not act until it sees whatthe <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> does.Republicans have spent more time broadly discussing a need to address thenation 's immigration laws , and they will hold a session <DATE>Friday</DATE> on " successfulcommunications with minorities and women . 
" <LOCATION>Walden</LOCATION> , responsible for getting more Republicans elected to the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> aschairman of the <ORGANIZATION>National Republican Congressional Committee</ORGANIZATION> , said he hopes theGOP will be more sensitive to how it appeals to Hispanics before futureelections . 
" We may not understand how what we say is interpreted by others and we have tobe sensitive and understand the effect of our language , " he said.heldermanr@washpost.comed.okeefe@washingtonpost.comLori <PERSON>Montgomery</PERSON> contributed to this report .
