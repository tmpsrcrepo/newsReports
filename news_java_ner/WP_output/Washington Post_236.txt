Next week , when President <PERSON>C.D.</PERSON> " Dan " Mote welcomes freshmen to the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> ofMaryland , he will inform them that the college police will enforce underagedrinking laws " with terrific ferocity . " 
And then he will turn around and , recognizing that most students do drink , tell the teenagers " to take care ofeach other when they see someone who 's passed out , to take advantage of all ofour services for students who abuse alcohol . " 
" We have a real conflict here , " Mote says , and he 's talking not only about theCollege Park campus but about every university and about our entire society . 
Welive in a time when efforts to enforce the prohibition on drinking before age 21are more aggressive than ever , yet there is a common assumption that most youngpeople routinely violate that law.Mote is tired of living that contradiction , which is why he joined more than 100other college presidents in signing a call for action , the Amethyst Initiative , a collective statement that the 21-year-old drinking age is not working and hascreated a culture of binge drinking on campuses nationwide . 
( Amethyst is fromthe ancient Greek for " not intoxicated . " ) 
Too many colleges have become grim enclaves of student binge drinking that leadsto all manner of degrading and ugly behavior . 
" Virtually every sexual assault isassociated with alcohol abuse , " Mote says . 
" Almost every assault of any kind isrelated to drinking . 
The drinking-age issue is not just about drinking anddriving . 
It 's a much bigger pie , and we college presidents see that whole pie . 
" The Amethyst Initiative , the brainchild of former <ORGANIZATION>Middlebury College presidentJohn McCardell</ORGANIZATION> , is an effort to push lawmakers and the broader public to dosomething that is politically tough : consider making it legal for younger peopleto drink.How could making teenage drinking easier possibly help reduce teen drinking?When I was in college three decades ago , 18-year-olds could drink openly andlegally and generally did so in public settings , including at cocktail partieswith faculty members and at a college-run pub where professors and staffersmixed with students . 
The result -- of course , with plenty of extreme exceptions -- was that kids learned moderation . 
Nobody had to hide , and adults were aroundconsiderably more often when students were drinking.The very notion of lowering the drinking age is flabbergasting to groups such asMothers Against Drunk Driving , which this week put out a statement arguing thata <DATE>1984</DATE> federal law forcing states to raise the legal age to 21 has saved 25,000 lives . 
<ORGANIZATION>MADD</ORGANIZATION> agrees that campus bingeing is a big problem and says the answer isto tighten alcohol policies , punish violators and go after adults who providealcohol to kids.But Mote and other presidents can point to long lists of enforcement , educationand counseling efforts that are in place , with little real impact . 
" The social contract is broken , " <ORGANIZATION>Mote</ORGANIZATION> tells me . 
" Legislators have made laws thatthe people do not take seriously . 
Students point to our alcohol programs andsay , ' See , everybody understands that we are going to drink , ' and they ' reright . 
" Mote signed the petition in a fit of optimism , hoping a serious nationalconversation might ensue.Are college presidents , after 30 years of being selected mainly for theirability to raise money , finally taking a stand ? 
Are they ready to sound thealarm about how a hypocritical , ineffective prohibition is hampering thecreation of an educated electorate?Well , maybe . 
In just 48 hours since <ORGANIZATION>Mote</ORGANIZATION> 's participation in the initiativebecame public , he 's been besieged with criticism . 
<LOCATION>Maryland Del</LOCATION> . 
Bill <PERSON>Bronrott</PERSON> ( D-Montgomery ) wants Mote and other presidents to remove their names from thepetition and get tougher on enforcing the law . 
Bronrott , a physician who workson alcohol issues , says the research supports the success of the higher agelimit in reducing deaths.But what if a lower drinking age might teach a vast number of young peoplemoderation , even as members of the reckless fringe continue to endangerthemselves and others ? 
Anti-drunken driving activists hide behind thefaux-clarity of highway death statistics.When he signed the initiative , <ORGANIZATION>Mote</ORGANIZATION> says , " I thought the country might be ready.Now ? 
It depends on how quickly people shut down open discussion . 
Will this leadto a national movement ? 
I do n't see how that would happen at the moment . 
" Can you imagine either presidential candidate discussing a change in thedrinking age ? 
They 'd be more likely to call for an end to anti-terrorismmeasures . 
So Mote will stand before the freshmen , implore them not to drink and threatenthem with enforcement -- and then , because it 's the responsible thing to do , hewill tell them how to handle it when they get plastered . 
Which they will . 
But wedo n't want to see it , because there 's a law on the books.That 's the first lecture in Cynicism 101 .
