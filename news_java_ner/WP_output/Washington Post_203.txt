Snow days , kids and school officials have always been a delicate mix.But a phone call to a <LOCATION>Fairfax County</LOCATION> public school administrator 's home lastweek about a snow day -- or lack of one -- has taken on a life of its own.Through the ubiquity of Facebook and YouTube , the call has become a rallying cryfor students ' First Amendment rights , and it shows that the generation gap hasbecome a technological chasm.It started with <DATE>Thursday</DATE> 's snowfall , estimated at about three inches near <ORGANIZATION>LakeBraddock Secondary School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Burke</LOCATION> . 
On his lunch break , <PERSON>Lake Braddock</PERSON> seniorDevraj " <PERSON>Dave " S. Kori</PERSON> , 17 , used a listed home phone number to call Dean Tistadt , chief operating officer for the county system , to ask why he had not closed theschools . 
Kori left his name and phone number and got a message later in the dayfrom <ORGANIZATION>Tistadt</ORGANIZATION> 's wife . 
" How dare you call us at home ! 
If you have a problem with going to school , youdo not call somebody 's house and complain about it , " Candy Tistadt 's minute-longmessage began . 
At one point , she uttered the phrase " snotty-nosed little brats , " and near the end , she said , " Get over it , kid , and go to school ! 
" Not so long ago , that might have been the end of it -- a few choice words by anagitated administrator ( or spouse ) . 
But with the frenetic pace of students ' online networking , it 's harder for grown-ups to have the last word . 
<PERSON>Kori</PERSON> 's calland <ORGANIZATION>Tistadt</ORGANIZATION> 's response sparked online debate among area students about whetherthe student 's actions constituted harassment and whether the response waswarranted.Kori took <ORGANIZATION>Tistadt</ORGANIZATION> 's message , left on his cellphone , and posted an audio link ona Facebook page he had created after he got home from school called " Let themknow what you think about schools not being cancelled . " 
The Web page listed DeanTistadt 's work and home numbers.The Tistadts received dozens more calls that day and night , Dean Tistadt said.Most were hang-ups , but at one point , they were coming every five minutes -- oneat <TIME>4 a.m.</TIME> , he said . 
At the same time , his wife 's response was spreading throughcyberspace.Within a day , hundreds of people had listened to her message , which was alsoposted on YouTube . 
A friend of <PERSON>Kori</PERSON> 's sent it to a local television newsstation , and it was aired on the nightly news program . 
As of yesterday , morethan 9,000 people had clicked on the YouTube link . 
Hundreds of comments had beenposted on the Facebook and YouTube pages , largely about what constitutes properand polite requests for public information from students.One <ORGANIZATION>Oakton High School</ORGANIZATION> student said in a posting yesterday that the crank callsto the Tistadts ' home were out of line but that <PERSON>Kori</PERSON> 's call was appropriate . 
" Iam not happy that [ Dean Tistadt ] gambled multiple times with our safety just sowe might have a bit more knowledge crammed in our heads at school , " he wrote.A <ORGANIZATION>Westfield High School</ORGANIZATION> student agreed : " thank God someone stood up for us atlast ! 
" Some were just as adamant the other way . 
A student from <PERSON>James Madison</PERSON> HighSchool in <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> wrote : " It 's called a home phone number for a reason . 
My dad isa physician and I ca n't tell you how irritating it is to get calls at all hoursof the <TIME>night</TIME> from people who think they are entitled to immediate attention . 
. 
. 
leave the poor guy alone . 
" <PERSON>Kori</PERSON> , a member of the <PERSON>Lake Braddock</PERSON> debate team who said his grade-point averageis 3.977 , said his message was not intended to harass . 
He said that he triedunsuccessfully to contact Dean Tistadt at work and that he thought he had abasic right to petition a public official for more information about a decisionthat affected him and his classmates . 
He said he was exercising freedom ofspeech in posting a Facebook page . 
The differing interpretations of his actionsprobably stem from " a generation gap , " he said . 
" People in my generation view privacy differently . 
We are the cellphonegeneration . 
We are used to being reached at all times , " he said.Kori explained his perspective in an e-mail yesterday to <LOCATION>Fairfax County</LOCATION> schoolsspokesman <PERSON>Paul Regnier</PERSON> . 
<PERSON>Regnier</PERSON> said , also in an e-mail , that <PERSON>Kori</PERSON> 's decision toplace the phone call to the Tistadts ' home was more likely the result of a " civility gap . " 
" It 's really an issue of kids learning what is acceptable and not acceptable.Any call to a public servant 's house is harassment , " <PERSON>Regnier</PERSON> said in aninterview.Kori said that he was called into the principal 's office to discuss the matterbut that he was not punished.Candy <PERSON>Tistadt</PERSON> did not return phone messages , but Dean Tistadt credited <PERSON>Kori</PERSON> forhaving the " courage of his convictions to stand up and be identified . " 
He alsocredited him for causing the high volume of crank calls , not to mentionconsiderable grief and embarrassment for his wife . 
" This has been horrible for her , " he said , adding that he and his wife bothlearned a hard lesson about the long reach of the Internet.To hear audio of <ORGANIZATION>Candy Tistadt</ORGANIZATION> 's call to Devraj " <PERSON>Dave " S. Kori</PERSON> , go http://towww.washingtonpost.com/metro .
