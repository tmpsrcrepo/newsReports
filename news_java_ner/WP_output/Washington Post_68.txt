Days after a 16-year-old girl said she was raped on an <PERSON>Ashburn</PERSON> jogging trail , residents say they feel as safe as ever in their leafy , family-orientedneighborhood -- although they have vowed to be more vigilant.The girl told authorities that she was walking on a paved trail along ClaiborneParkway near the <LOCATION>Dulles Greenway</LOCATION> about <TIME>8 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>April 28</DATE> when a man grabbed herfrom behind , pulled her into a wooded area and assaulted her . 
She reported theattack to the <ORGANIZATION>Loudoun County Sheriff 's Office</ORGANIZATION> that night , officials said.On <DATE>Friday</DATE> , officials released a composite sketch of the man . 
He is described asa white male in his late teens or early 20s , about 6 feet tall , with brown eyes , short black hair and bad acne . 
He was wearing a long white T-shirt and blackpants at the time of the incident , officials said.Because the trail is heavily traveled and near a major road , the sheriff ' soffice says it is likely someone saw the man . 
" <LOCATION>Claiborne Parkway</LOCATION> at 8 o'clock at night is not deserted , " spokesman <PERSON>KraigTroxell</PERSON> said . 
" Someone may have seen something . 
" Deputies are combing through recent cases to see whether someone matching thatdescription was involved in another incident in that area . 
So far , nothing hasturned up , <PERSON>Troxell</PERSON> said.This is the first such incident in <LOCATION>Loudoun County</LOCATION> in recent memory , he said . 
Butsuch incidents have occurred in other parts of the region . 
In <DATE>March</DATE> , an18-year-old man believed to have been behind several incidents in <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> andAlexandria was convicted in the sexual assault and beating of a woman on theFour Mile Run.Ashburn Farm residents say it 's hard to imagine their popular trail as the sceneof such a violent crime . 
The well-maintained , unnamed path hugs ClaiborneParkway , a busy thoroughfare , and is only sporadically obscured from drivers ' view . 
It runs between the roadway and a dense stretch of woods that backs up tosome homes . 
" Obviously I 'm very concerned for the girl and the family , and I 'm concernedthey find who did this , but I 'm not feeling like I need to change any of mypatterns , " said <PERSON>Glenn Maravetz</PERSON> , vice president of the <ORGANIZATION>Ashburn Farm</ORGANIZATION> homeownersassociation.To some women , it reinforced the need to be careful . 
<PERSON>Shawn Nabors</PERSON> , 41 , who livesfour blocks from the trail , said years ago she was followed by a man while shewas running on a trail in another community.She escaped unharmed , but the experience awakened in her an attention to safetythat has stuck . 
She tries to change her daily pattern , she said , running atdifferent times of the day so no one can predict her movements . 
And she triesnever to go jogging alone . 
" After 20 years of changing patterns , it is a way of life , " she said . 
" Maybe forthese young girls it 's brand new to them . 
" Violent-crime experts say people should follow some basic precautions while onwalking and jogging trails , such as going in groups and being aware ofsurroundings . 
When jogging alone , a person should either leave MP3 players athome or keep the volume low , said <ORGANIZATION>Easton McDonald</ORGANIZATION> , a deputy specialist with thesheriff 's office . 
" Sometimes you wo n't pick up on a person behind you , " said <ORGANIZATION>McDonald</ORGANIZATION> , who hastaught self-defense techniques to women . 
" That could mean the difference betweenbecoming a victim and being able to run away .
