Okay , men , I double dog dare y' all to do it here.Come to this military conference , look into the eyes of the commander of awarship or the strike officer who was in charge of deploying Tomahawk cruisemissile tests or the major christened " The Angel of Death " by an Afghan general , and tell these women that you want to decide their reproductive future.Go ahead , Rush , and see if you have the nerve to call any of these women inuniform sluts for using contraceptives to plan their families arounddeployments.I dare you.This was my first thought when I walked into a <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> ballroom <DATE>Monday</DATE> filledwith about 1,700 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> servicewomen from all five branches of the military.Hundreds of uniforms , stars , bars and medals , including at least a dozenkind-of-billowy maternity uniforms , and about 1,700 ramrod straight backs.The <ORGANIZATION>Sea Service Leadership Association</ORGANIZATION> said this is the largest gathering ofmilitary women ever . 
It offers an opportunity for those in uniform to speak notonly about being service members but also about being women . 
" Usually , we find ourselves in the minority , " said <ORGANIZATION>Navy</ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON>Nicole L.Maver-Shue</PERSON> , who is president of the association that put on the conference.For retired <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> Brig. Gen. <PERSON>Wilma Vaught</PERSON> , one of the military 's mostdecorated women , that sea of uniformed women was an amazing sight . 
It was a bitdifferent when she was one woman with 3,300 men in <LOCATION>Guam</LOCATION> or one of the only womenin her military unit in <LOCATION>Saigon</LOCATION> in the <DATE>1960s</DATE> . 
She looked at one of the few men in the ballroom and said she felt like sayingto him : " Do you feel like you 're a minority ? 
Because that 's how it felt in everymeeting I went to . 
" The association gave Vaught a lifetime achievement award . 
And because it waswomen awarding a woman , the presenter said , the general was presented with ajeweled brooch " rather than just a pyramid for her desk . 
" Vaught , an American pioneer for women in the military , is a living example ofhow far women in the military have come . 
The women applauding her were pilots , warship commanders , rear admirals and platoon leaders.No men should be lecturing these women about any aspect of their reproductivelives , <PERSON>Vaught</PERSON> said . 
" As I watch this whole thing , the talk about sex - contraception and abortionand all these other things - I look at legislators , who are majority male , " Vaught told me . 
" They 're perfectly willing to vote and take away " rights thatshould be between women and their doctors.Of course , military women do have one advantage over their civiliancounterparts : their health insurance , Tricare , covers their contraception.America 's active-duty military is nearly <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> female . 
And it 's the kind ofplace where hair is pulled back and gender is rarely discussed . 
" It 's not like I actively hide it . 
But you just do n't put it out there , youdo n't talk about female things , and you do n't want to make waves , " said <ORGANIZATION>AirForce</ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON>Allison Black</PERSON> , the first female AC-130H Spectre navigator to openfire in combat . 
She became known as the <ORGANIZATION>Angel of Death</ORGANIZATION> in Afghanistan.Back home in <LOCATION>Fairfax Station</LOCATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Angel of Death</ORGANIZATION> has two sons , 4 and 6 , andcoaches their T-ball team . 
She does n't make a big deal about juggling herparenting duties with her day job , and neither do other women in uniform.This conference , which is in its 25th year and gets bigger each year , is the oneplace where they feel comfortable talking about not only their careers but alsoabout being women and mothers . 
" We 're the only military conference that has a lactation room , " Maver-Shuedeclared . 
Outside in the hallways , I talked to women about their biggest concerns . 
A groupof <ORGANIZATION>Marines</ORGANIZATION> was talking about the challenge women can sometimes pose to oneanother . 
" Us ! 
We can be our own worst enemies ! " 
one <ORGANIZATION>Marine</ORGANIZATION> said . 
" We 're the few , the proud . 
And there 's so few of us women , we look out forourselves but not always each other , " another said.Over at a <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> clique , the talk was of the uniforms , how the sizes thatmost women need are really hard to find . 
And how full-sleeve tattoos are okaybut nail polish is n't . 
" Yes , there are big issues : sexual assault , pregnancy is a big one , work/lifebalance , " <PERSON>Maver-Shue</PERSON> said . 
" But here we get to talk about them and work to solvethem from a woman 's perspective . 
" There 's no name-calling , no frat-boy pranks set to raunchy music while talkingabout intrusive medical procedures.It 's just women who can talk Howitzers , missile deployments , child care and nailpolish without worry.dvorakp@washpost.comPetula <PERSON>Dvorak</PERSON> will respond to your comments about this column at noon <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> atwashingtonpost.com/dvorak , where you can read her previous columns .
