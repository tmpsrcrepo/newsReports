W hatever you think of <PERSON>Dyana Mason</PERSON> 's mission , there 's no question she has avery tough job . 
Mason runs <LOCATION>Equality Virginia</LOCATION> , which makes her the lobbyist forgay rights in a state where gay marriage is a topic for a future century ( onanother planet ) , legislators openly trade anti-gay slurs , and the state attorneygeneral resists relaxing the anti-sodomy law even after the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Supreme Courtorders up a change.Mason , 33 , gamely works the halls of the Capitol , testifying against the flurryof bills introduced each year to ensure that homosexuals do n't get treated likeother Virginians . 
" This bill could mean that me and my partner of four years could not visit eachother in the hospital if one of us was sick , " <PERSON>Mason</PERSON> told senators considering anAffirmation of Marriage Act last week . 
" This bill would continue to codifysecond-class status for one group of Virginians . 
" Senators listened politely , asked no questions , and then discussed amongthemselves how gay marriage would lead to <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> schoolchildren having tolisten to gay teachers proselytizing on behalf of homosexuality . 
" The average Virginian , if you ask them ' What do you think of gay people ? ' 
it 's ' Live and let live , ' " <PERSON>Mason</PERSON> contends . 
" But in the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> , if there isthe word ' gay ' in there anywhere , they will throw up a wall , do anything to stopit . 
They 'll do stuff that is clearly illegal or against the spirit of the law . 
" Nonetheless -- or perhaps because of the legislature 's firm stance againstexpanding civil rights for gays -- <ORGANIZATION>Mason</ORGANIZATION> 's group has seen its membership jumpfrom less than 1,000 to more than 2,500 in the past year . 
When Equality Virginiaheld its annual reception last month , 24 legislators and the governor andlieutenant governor showed up , a big boost for <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> 's most marginalizedlobby.Mason took on this job a year ago , moving to <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Northern Virginia</LOCATION> , where she lived while working for the Human Rights Campaign , a national gayrights lobby . 
Before that , she worked for green groups on the <LOCATION>West Coast</LOCATION> , soshe 's used to being on the losing side of political battles . 
" In six yearsworking for an environmental group , we never got one of our bills to even comeup for a vote , " she says.Despite open antagonism from many conservatives -- <LOCATION>Del</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Robert Marshall</PERSON> ( R-Prince <LOCATION>William</LOCATION> ) , the gay lobby 's most vociferous opponent , called the SupremeCourt ruling on sodomy an " apocalypse for society , " while <LOCATION>Del</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Brad Marrs</PERSON> ( R-Richmond ) called homosexuality " a form of sexual misconduct that is a crime " -- <PERSON>Mason</PERSON> says legislators treat her ( and the state 's first openly gay lawmaker , <LOCATION>Del</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Adam Ebbin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> ) with respect.She does not expect that popular acceptance of gay people will come primarilyfrom rewriting laws . 
" The main issue is that we have not educated enoughfair-minded people yet , " <PERSON>Mason</PERSON> says . 
" The only way to change hearts and minds isfor more people to get to know a gay person . " 
To push that process along , <PERSON>Masonspends</PERSON> much of her time traveling around the state , particularly to smallercommunities , encouraging closeted gays to come out.As with so many issues in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , there 's a deep cultural divide between theWashington area , where <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> and other jurisdictions have been frustrated inattempts to win state permission to grant benefits to partners of gay employees , and more conservative , rural places . 
But <PERSON>Mason</PERSON> believes that even statewide , aconstitutional amendment banning gay marriage might not win voter approval . 
" Polls show that people in the South are the least likely to know a gay person , " she says , but even so , opposition to gay marriage runs only about 5 percenthigher in the South than elsewhere.Still , <ORGANIZATION>Mason</ORGANIZATION> 's immediate goals are more modest : " We have to demonstrate it 's notcool to make an anti-gay slur . 
" I argued that the in-your-face openness of many <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> legislators ' hostilityis actually refreshing -- would n't you rather know precisely where your opponentstands than have to deal with sub rosa animosity ? 
" No , " <PERSON>Mason</PERSON> says , " we have to get slurs out of the public discussion . 
If we getthat stuff stopped , we have a better chance of everyone being treated withrespect . 
These fights are decades-long , not something that is going to bedecided in one legislative session . "
