THE SHIFTING composition of <ORGANIZATION>the Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> , by focusing attention on thefuture of abortion rights , has shoved the issue front and center in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> ' sgubernatorial race for the first time in 16 years . 
That has made thingsuncomfortable for both major-party candidates , Democratic Lt. Gov. <PERSON>Timothy M.Kaine</PERSON> and Republican former attorney general <PERSON>Jerry W. Kilgore</PERSON> , who , in theircontrasting ways , have each sought to soften their position with carefullycrafted wording . 
Of the two , Mr. <PERSON>Kilgore</PERSON> is by far the more egregious straddler.While wrapping himself in the pro-life banner , he ducks the crucial issue ofwhether he would favor outlawing abortion.That is not a wildly speculative question , as he has disingenuously insisted.Roe <PERSON>v. Wade</PERSON> , the <DATE>1973</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> decision that upheld a woman 's right toabortion , is the target of concerted efforts by social conservatives who want toreverse it . 
Depending on changes in the court 's composition , the justices couldgive the states considerably more latitude to regulate abortion , which could inturn prompt some states to enact laws that would test the premise of Roe . 
Afuture court might overturn it , which would put the issue squarely in the handsof state lawmakers . 
Candidates for governor should state whether they would signlegislation that would end three decades of abortion rights.But Mr. <PERSON>Kilgore</PERSON> , though resolutely against abortion , wo n't go there ; hedismissed <PERSON>Tim Russert</PERSON> 's question on the subject at a candidates ' debate lastmonth as " hypothetical " ; he then immediately answered an equally hypotheticalquestion on taxes . 
No doubt he knows that at least a sixth , and possibly a greatdeal more , of American women have had abortions , and that a huge majority ofAmericans , no matter their qualms about abortion , oppose overturning Roe v.Wade.So Mr. <PERSON>Kilgore</PERSON> is left with an incoherent position : On the one hand he opposesabortion , except if a pregnancy threatens a mother 's life or in the case of rapeor incest -- providing the woman reports the crime to the police within aweek . 
And he has courted pro-life groups that are determined to outlaw abortion.On the other hand he insists he is " not going to do anything to criminalizewomen " who have abortions , while refusing to take a position on legislation toban the procedure . 
It does n't add up to an honest stance.Mr . 
<PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> , a practicing Catholic , also casts himself as a pro-life candidate ; like Mr. <PERSON>Kilgore</PERSON> , he says he is morally opposed to abortion . 
He has backedrestrictions on it ( including parental consent ) , supports the teaching of sexualabstinence in schools to curtail teen pregnancy and favors promoting adoption asan alternative for women facing unwanted pregnancies . 
But on the bottom-lineissue , Mr. <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> is clear : He would veto legislation to ban abortion . 
You canargue that Mr. <PERSON>Kaine</PERSON> 's position is inconsistent . 
But unlike his opponent , atleast he has taken a position.This is one in a series of editorials on issues in the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> gubernatorialrace .
