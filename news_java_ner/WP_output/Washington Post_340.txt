The week before <DATE>Christmas</DATE> , 3 million people watched the <ORGANIZATION>Discovery Channel</ORGANIZATION> 's newreality show , " Amish Mafia , " making it the second-most-viewed cable show thatnight , after the trashy hit " Moonshiners . " 
This is surprising for two reasons : First , it reveals Americans ' enduring fetish with all things Amish ; there are250 ,000 Amish in <LOCATION>North America</LOCATION> , putting the number of people watching " AmishMafia " at more than 10 times the number of actual Amish people . 
And second , theshow is really so awful , it does n't deserve to be on TV.The fourth episode , which aired this week , reached new lows of ludicrousness.The Amish mafia don <PERSON>Lebanon Levi</PERSON> absconds to <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Esther</PERSON> , the girl heloves , who at the beach discards her traditional " plain " garb for a 1940spinup-style one-piece . 
Meanwhile , back in <LOCATION>Lancaster County</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Levi</PERSON> 's colleaguesare organizing horse-and-buggy drag races and throwing illicit parties ( forcash ) in authentically Amish venues.If ever a commercial enterprise could be accused of turning religion into afreak show , " Amish Mafia " is it . 
In the last 10 minutes of the show , asmall-in-stature Amish person gives the film crew a tour of his house , whichincludes a glimpse of the kitchen , where water comes out of a hand pump , and ofthe unplumbed bathroom , where three holes are cut , side by side , into a woodenbox . 
This one scene , in which religious-minority status and outhouse humorcollide , should have been widely criticized as offensive , not tweeted about withlow-brow glee . 
Imagine if the tour guide to the toilet had been an Orthodox Jew.Or a Muslim . 
Or a Mormon.The media buzz about " Amish Mafia " centers on whether it 's " real . " 
Are therereally tough-guy enforcers ( with guns ) living within the Amish community andoutside the law , collecting debts and protecting the virtue of their women?Lancaster Amish say no . 
<PERSON>Ira Wagler</PERSON> , author of last year 's memoir " Growing UpAmish , " has close ties to the Lancaster Amish community . 
" When it came out , Iwent to my closest friends , " <PERSON>Wagler</PERSON> said . 
" These know <PERSON>Lebanon Levi</PERSON> , and theysaid the whole thing is completely made up . 
" Discovery says yes . 
" They are actual people , " a Discovery spokeswoman told areporter recently . 
" These are real people in the Amish and Mennonitecommunities . " 
In any case , the show posts disclaimers all over the place.But what " Amish Mafia " shows me is how very far Americans are from anythingresembling what the pundits and policymakers optimistically call " interfaithunderstanding . " 
The Amish do n't look like other Americans , they do n't live likeus and they do n't , by and large , want to talk about it . 
This means thatAmericans can idealize the Amish - or any other unfamiliar group of believers - and tear them down at will , making judgments without knowledge.On the one hand , Americans regard the Amish as a peace-loving clan of countryfolk who eat dinner together every night by lantern light . 
They are a touristattraction . 
A yearning for this old-fashioned simplicity explains why sales ofromance novels set in Amish country were all the rage for so many years.Forty-nine authors are now engaged writing what are called " bonnet rippers " - Harlequin Romance-type novels without the sex , says <PERSON>Steve Oates</PERSON> , vice presidentof marketing at the Christian publisher <ORGANIZATION>Bethany House</ORGANIZATION> . 
This idealizationpersists , despite the fact that the community struggles , according to an essayby <PERSON>Michael Shank</PERSON> in this newspaper , with " physical and sexual abuse , mentaldisabilities , and obsessive-compulsive disorders . 
" And when the Amish show themselves to be craven , fallen individuals ( like therest of us ) , Americans react with a sensationalistic schadenfreude , as iffinally , finally , those perfect people are revealing their true selves . 
" Whenone of them has a failure , it 's like ha-ha-ha , " <PERSON>Oates</PERSON> says . 
Last year 's story ofmembers of a breakaway Amish sect in <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> imprisoned for forcibly cutting thehair and beards of dissidents was an Internet phenomenon . 
Even now , a monthbefore their sentencing , the phrase " beard cutting " generates 10 million hits onGoogle , the first 10 pages devoted exclusively to the Amish . 
Neither perspectivecomes anywhere near the truth . 
" Amish are people like everybody else , " <PERSON>Wagler</PERSON> says . 
But that 's a lesson youwo n't learn on " Amish Mafia .
