IF <PERSON>HARLAN GIRARD</PERSON> IS CRAZY , HE DOES N'T ACT THE PART . 
He is standing just where hesaid he would be , below the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> train station 's World War II memorial -- a soaring statue of a winged angel embracing a fallen combatant , as iflifting him to heaven . 
Girard is wearing pressed khaki pants , expensive-lookingleather loafers and a crisp blue button-down . 
He looks like a local businessmandressed for a casual <DATE>Friday</DATE> -- a local businessman with a wickedly dark senseof humor , which had become apparent when he said to look for him beneath " theangel sodomizing a dead soldier . " 
At 70 , he appears robust and healthy -- notthe slightest bit disheveled or unusual-looking . 
He is also carrying a bag.Girard 's description of himself is matter-of-fact , until he explains what 's inthe bag : documents he believes prove that the government is attempting tocontrol his mind . 
He carries that black , weathered bag everywhere he goes . 
" Every time I go out , I 'm prepared to come home and find everything is stolen , " he says.The bag aside , <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> appears intelligent and coherent . 
At a table in front ofDunkin ' Donuts inside the train station , <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> opens the bag and pulls out athick stack of documents , carefully labeled and sorted with yellow sticky notesbearing neat block print . 
The documents are an authentic-looking mix of newsstories , articles culled from military journals and even some declassifiednational security documents that do seem to show that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government hasattempted to develop weapons that send voices into people 's heads . 
" It 's undeniable that the technology exists , " <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> says , " but if you go to thepolice and say , ' I 'm hearing voices , ' they 're going to lock you up forpsychiatric evaluation . 
" The thing that 's missing from his bag -- the lack of which makes it hard toprove he is n't crazy -- is even a single document that would buttress theimplausible notion that the government is currently targeting a large group ofAmerican citizens with mind-control technology . 
The only direct evidence forthat , <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> admits , lies with alleged victims such as himself.And of those , there are many.IT 'S 9:01 <LOCATION>P.M</LOCATION> . 
WHEN THE FIRST PERSON SPEAKS during the <DATE>Saturday</DATE> conference call.Unsure whether anyone else is on the line yet , the female caller throws out thefirst question : " You got gang stalking or V2K ? " 
she asks no one in particular.There 's a short , uncomfortable pause . 
" V2K , really bad . 
24-7 , " a man replies . 
" Gang stalking , " another woman says . 
" Oh , yeah , join the club , " yet another man replies.The members of this confessional " club " are not your usual victims . 
This is n't agroup for alcoholics , drug addicts or survivors of childhood abuse ; the peopleconnecting on the call are self-described victims of mind control -- peoplewho believe they have been targeted by a secret government program that tracksthem around the clock , using technology to probe and control their minds.The callers frequently refer to themselves as TIs , which is short for TargetedIndividuals , and talk about V2K -- the official military abbreviation standsfor " voice to skull " and denotes weapons that beam voices or sounds into thehead . 
In their esoteric lexicon , " gang stalking " refers to the belief that theyare being followed and harassed : by neighbors , strangers or colleagues who areagents for the government.A few more " hellos " are exchanged , interrupted by beeps signaling late arrivals : Bill from <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Barbara</PERSON> from <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Jim</PERSON> from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and a dozenor so others.Derrick <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> , the conference call moderator , calls order . 
" It 's five after 9 , " says <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> , with the sweetly reasonable intonation of alate-night radio host . 
" Maybe we should go ahead and start . 
" THE IDEA OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE CONVINCED THEY ARE TARGETED BY WEAPONS that caninvade their minds has become a cultural joke , shorthanded by the image ofsolitary lunatics wearing tinfoil hats to deflect invisible mind beams . 
" Tinfoilhat , " says <LOCATION>Wikipedia</LOCATION> , has become " a popular stereotype and term of derision ; thephrase serves as a byword for paranoia and is associated with conspiracytheorists . 
" In <DATE>2005</DATE> , a group of <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> students conducted a formal study using aluminum foiland radio signals . 
Their surprising finding : Tinfoil hats may actually amplifyradio frequency signals . 
Of course , the tech students meant the study as a joke.But during the <DATE>Saturday</DATE> conference call , the subject of aluminum foil is deadlyserious . 
The <ORGANIZATION>MIT</ORGANIZATION> study had prompted renewed debate ; while a few TIs realized itwas a joke at their expense , some saw the findings as an explanation for whytinfoil did n't seem to stop the voices . 
Others vouched for the material . 
" Tinfoil helps tremendously , " reports one conference call participant , whodescribes wrapping it around her body underneath her clothing . 
" Where do you put the tinfoil ? " 
a man asks . 
" Anywhere , everywhere , " she replies . 
" I even put it in a hat . 
" A TI in an online mind-control forum recommends a Web site called " Block EMF " ( as in electromagnetic frequencies ) , which advertises a full line of clothing , including aluminum-lined boxer shorts described as a " sheer , comfortableundergarment you can wear over your regular one to shield yourself from powerlines and computer electric fields , and microwave , radar , and TV radiation . 
" Similarly , a tinfoil hat disguised as a regular baseball cap is " smart andsubtle . 
" For all the scorn , the ranks of victims -- or people who believe they arevictims -- are speaking up . 
In the course of the <TIME>evening</TIME> , there are as many as40 clicks from people joining the call , and much larger numbers participate inthe online forum , which has 143 members . 
A note there mentioning interest from ajournalist prompted more than 200 e-mail responses.Until recently , people who believe the government is beaming voices into theirheads would have added social isolation to their catalogue of woes . 
But now , many have discovered hundreds , possibly thousands , of others just like them allover the world . 
Web sites dedicated to electronic harassment and gang stalkinghave popped up in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION> , the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> , Russiaand elsewhere . 
Victims have begun to host support meetings in major cities , including <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . 
Favorite topics at the meetings include lessons on how tobuild shields ( the proverbial tinfoil hats ) , media and PR training , and possiblelegal strategies for outlawing mind control.The biggest hurdle for TIs is getting people to take their concerns seriously . 
Aproposal made in <DATE>2001</DATE> by Rep. <PERSON>Dennis Kucinich</PERSON> ( D-Ohio ) to ban " psychotronicweapons " ( another common term for mind-control technology ) was hailed by TIs asa great step forward . 
But the bill was widely derided by bloggers and columnistsand quickly <PERSON>dropped.Doug Gordon</PERSON> , <PERSON>Kucinich</PERSON> 's spokesman , would not discuss mind control other than tosay the proposal was part of broader legislation outlawing weapons in space . 
Thebill was later reintroduced , minus the mind control . 
" It was not theconcentration of the legislation , which is why it was tightened up andredrafted , " was all <PERSON>Gordon</PERSON> would say.Unable to garner much support from their elected representatives , TIs havestarted their own PR campaign . 
And so , last <DATE>spring</DATE> , the <DATE>Saturday</DATE> conferencecalls centered on plans to hold a rally in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . 
A <DATE>2005</DATE> attempt at a rallydrew a few dozen people and was ultimately rained out ; the TIs were determinedto make another go of it . 
Conversations focused around designing T-shirts , setting up congressional appointments , fundraising , creating a new Web site andformalizing a slogan . 
After some debate over whether to focus on gang stalkingor mind control , the group came up with a compromise slogan that covered both : " Freedom From Covert Surveillance and Electronic Harassment . 
" Conference call moderator <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> , who says his gang stalking began when heworked at the <ORGANIZATION>National Security Agency</ORGANIZATION> in the <DATE>1980s</DATE> , offers his assessment ofthe group 's prospects : Maybe this rally would n't produce much press , but it 's afirst step . 
" I see this as a movement , " he says . 
" We 're picking up people allthe time . 
" <PERSON>HARLAN GIRARD</PERSON> SAYS HIS PROBLEMS BEGAN IN <DATE>1983</DATE> , while he was a real estatedeveloper in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> . 
The harassment was subtle at first : One day a womanpulled up in a car , wagged her finger at him , then sped away ; he saw peoplerunning underneath his window at night ; he noticed some of his neighbors seemedto be watching him ; he heard someone moving in the crawl space under hisapartment at night.Girard sought advice from this then-girlfriend , a practicing psychologist , whomhe declines to identify . 
He says she told him , " Nobody can become psychotic intheir late 40s . " 
She said he did n't seem to manifest other symptoms of psychoticbehavior -- he dressed well , paid his bills -- and , besides his claims ofsurveillance , which sounded paranoid , he behaved normally . 
" People who arepsychotic are socially isolated , " he recalls her saying.After a few months , <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> says , the harassment abruptly stopped . 
But therespite did n't last . 
In <DATE>1984</DATE> , appropriately enough , things got seriously weird.He 'd left his real estate career to return to school at the <ORGANIZATION>University ofPennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> , where he was studying for a master 's degree in landscapearchitecture . 
He harbored dreams of designing parks and public spaces . 
Then , hesays , he began to hear voices . 
Girard could distinguish several different malevoices , which came complete with a mental image of how the voices were beinggenerated : from a recording studio , with " four slops sitting around a card tabledrinking beer , " he says.The voices were crass but also strangely courteous , addressing him as " Mr.Girard . 
" They taunted him . 
They asked him if he thought he was normal ; they suggested hewas going crazy . 
They insulted his classmates : When an overweight student showedup for a field trip in a white raincoat , they said , " Hey , Mr. <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> , does n'tshe look like a refrigerator ? 
" Six months after the voices began , they had another question for him : " Mr.Girard , Mr. <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> . 
Why are n't you dead yet ? " 
At first , he recalls , the voiceswould speak just two or three times a day , but it escalated into a near-constantcacophony , often accompanied by severe pain all over his body -- which <ORGANIZATION>Girardnow</ORGANIZATION> attributes to directed-energy weapons that can shoot invisible beams.The voices even suggested how he could figure out what was happening to him . 
Hesays they told him to go to the electrical engineering department to " tell themyou 're writing science fiction and you do n't want to write anything inconsistentwith physical reality . 
Then tell them exactly what has happened . 
" <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> went and got some rudimentary explanations of how technology couldexplain some of the things he was describing . 
" Finally , I said : ' Look , I must come to the point , because I need answers . 
Thisis happening to me ; it 's not science fiction . ' " 
They laughed.He got the same response from friends , he says . 
" They regarded me as crazy , which is a humiliating experience . 
" When asked why he did n't consult a doctor about the voices and the pain , hesays , " I do n't dare start talking to people because of the potential stigma ofit all . 
I do n't want to be treated differently . 
Here I was in Philadelphia.Something was going on , I do n't know any doctors . . . I know somebody 's doingsomething to me . 
" It was a struggle to graduate , he says , but he was determined , and hepersevered . 
In <DATE>1988</DATE> , the same year he finished his degree , his father died , leaving <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> an inheritance large enough that he did not have to work.So , instead of becoming a landscape architect , <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> began a full-timeinvestigation of what was happening to him , often traveling to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> inpursuit of government documents relating to mind control . 
He put an ad in amagazine seeking other victims . 
Only a few people responded . 
But over the years , as he met more and more people like himself , he grew convinced that he was partof what he calls an " electronic concentration camp . 
" What he was finding on his research trips also buttressed his belief : Girardlearned that in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> had drugged unwitting victims with LSD aspart of a rogue mind-control experiment called MK-ULTRA . 
He came acrossreferences to the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> seeking to influence the mind with electromagnetic fields.Then he found references in an academic research book to work that militaryresearchers at <ORGANIZATION>Walter Reed Army Institute of Research</ORGANIZATION> had done in the <DATE>1970s</DATE> withpulsed microwaves to transmit words that a subject would hear in his head.Elsewhere , he came across references to attempts to use electromagnetic energy , sound waves or microwave beams to cause non-lethal pain to the body . 
For everysymptom he experienced , he believed he found references to a weapon that couldcause it.How much of the research <ORGANIZATION>Girard</ORGANIZATION> cites checks out?Concerns about microwaves and mind control date to the <DATE>1960s</DATE> , when the U.S.government discovered that its embassy in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> was being bombarded bylow-level electromagnetic radiation . 
In <DATE>1965</DATE> , according to declassified DefenseDepartment documents , the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> , at the behest of the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> , launchedProject <ORGANIZATION>Pandora</ORGANIZATION> , top-secret research to explore the behavioral and biologicaleffects of low-level microwaves . 
For approximately four years , the Pentagonconducted secret research : zapping monkeys ; exposing unwitting sailors tomicrowave radiation ; and conducting a host of other unusual experiments ( asub-project of <ORGANIZATION>Project Pandora</ORGANIZATION> was titled Project Bizarre ) . 
The results weremixed , and the program was plagued by disagreements and scientific squabbles.The " <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> signal , " as it was called , was eventually attributed toeavesdropping , not mind control , and <ORGANIZATION>Pandora</ORGANIZATION> ended in <DATE>1970</DATE> . 
And with it , themilitary 's research into so-called non-thermal microwave effects seemed to dieout , at least in the unclassified realm.But there are hints of ongoing research : An academic paper written for the <ORGANIZATION>AirForce</ORGANIZATION> in the mid-1990s mentions the idea of a weapon that would use sound wavesto send words into a person 's head . 
" The signal can be a ' message from God ' thatcan warn the enemy of impending doom , or encourage the enemy to surrender , " theauthor concluded.In <DATE>2002</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force Research Laboratory</ORGANIZATION> patented precisely such a technology : using microwaves to send words into someone 's head . 
That work is frequentlycited on mind-control Web sites . 
<PERSON>Rich Garcia</PERSON> , a spokesman for the researchlaboratory 's directed energy directorate , declined to discuss that patent orcurrent or related research in the field , citing the lab 's policy not to commenton its microwave work.In response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed for this article , <ORGANIZATION>theAir Force</ORGANIZATION> released unclassified documents surrounding that <DATE>2002</DATE> patent -- records that note that the patent was based on human experimentation in October1994 at the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> lab , where scientists were able to transmit phrases intothe heads of human subjects , albeit with marginal intelligibility . 
Researchappeared to continue at least through <DATE>2002</DATE> . 
Where this work has gone since isunclear -- the research laboratory , citing classification , refused to discussit or release other materials.The official <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Air Force</ORGANIZATION> position is that there are no non-thermal effects ofmicrowaves . 
Yet <PERSON>Dennis Bushnell</PERSON> , chief scientist at <ORGANIZATION>NASA</ORGANIZATION> 's <ORGANIZATION>Langley ResearchCenter</ORGANIZATION> , tagged microwave attacks against the human brain as part of futurewarfare in a <DATE>2001</DATE> presentation to the <ORGANIZATION>National Defense Industrial Associationabout</ORGANIZATION> " Future Strategic Issues . " 
" That work is exceedingly sensitive " and unlikely to be reported in anyunclassified documents , he says.Meanwhile , the military 's use of weapons that employ electromagnetic radiationto create pain is well-known , as are some of the limitations of such weapons . 
In2001 , the <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> declassified one element of this research : the Active DenialSystem , a weapon that uses electromagnetic radiation to heat skin and create anintense burning sensation . 
So , yes , there is technology designed to beam painfulinvisible rays at humans , but the weapon seems to fall far short of what couldaccount for many of the TIs ' symptoms . 
While its exact range is classified , DougBeason , an expert in directed-energy weapons , puts it at about 700 meters , andthe beam can not penetrate a number of materials , such as aluminum . 
Consideringthe size of the full-scale weapon , which resembles a satellite dish , and itsoperational limitations , the ability of the government or anyone else to shootbeams at hundreds of people -- on city streets , into their homes and whilethey travel in cars and planes -- is beyond improbable.But , given the history of <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's clandestine research , it 's reasonable toassume that if the defense establishment could develop mind-control orlong-distance ray weapons , it almost certainly would . 
And , once developed , thepossibility that they might be tested on innocent civilians could not becategorically dismissed.Girard , for his part , believes these weapons were not only developed but werealso tested on him more than 20 years ago.What would the government gain by torturing him ? 
Again , <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> found what hebelieved to be an explanation , or at least a precedent : During the Cold War , thegovernment conducted radiation experiments on scores of unwitting victims , essentially using them as human guinea pigs . 
<PERSON>Girard</PERSON> came to believe that he , too , was a walking experiment.Not that <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> thinks his selection was totally random : He believes he wastargeted because of a disparaging remark he made to a Republican fundraiserabout <PERSON>George H.W. Bush</PERSON> in the early <DATE>1980s</DATE> . 
Later , <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> says , the voicesconfirmed his suspicion . 
" One night I was going to bed ; the usual drivel was going on , " he says . 
" Theconstant stream of drivel . 
I was just about to go to bed , and a voice says : ' Mr.Girard , do you know who was in our studio with us ? 
That was <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> , vicepresident of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> . ' 
" GIRARD 'S STORY , HOWEVER STRANGE , reflects what TIs around the world report : achance encounter with a government agency or official , followed by surveillanceand gang stalking , and then , in many cases , voices , and pain similar to electricshocks . 
Some in the community have taken it upon themselves to document as manycases as possible . 
One TI from <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> conducted about 50 interviews , narrowing the symptoms down to several major areas : " ringing in the ears , " " manipulation of body parts , " " hearing voices , " " piercing sensation on skin , " " sinus problems " and " sexual attacks . " 
In fact , the TI continued , " many reportthe sensation of having their genitalia manipulated . 
" Both male and female TIs report a variety of " attacks " to their sexual organs . 
" My testicles became so sore I could barely walk , " <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> says of his earlyexperiences . 
Others , however , report the attacks in the form of sexualstimulation , including one TI who claims he dropped out of the seminary afterconstant sexual stimulation by directed-energy weapons . 
<PERSON>Susan Sayler</PERSON> , a TI inSan Diego , says many women among the TIs suffer from attacks to their sexualorgans but are often embarrassed to talk about it with outsiders . 
" It 's sporadic , you just never know when it will happen , " she says . 
" A lot ofthe women say it 's as soon as you lay down in bed -- that 's when you would gethit the worst . 
It happened to me as I was driving , at odd times . 
" What made her think it was an electronic attack and not just in her head ? 
" Therewas no sexual attraction to a man when it would happen . 
That 's what was wrong.It did not feel like a muscle spasm or whatever , " she says . 
" It 's so . . . electronic . 
" <PERSON>Gloria Naylor</PERSON> , a renowned African American writer , seems to defy many of thestereotypes of someone who believes in mind control . 
A winner of the <ORGANIZATION>NationalBook Award</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Naylor</PERSON> is best known for her acclaimed novel , <ORGANIZATION>The Women of BrewsterPlace</ORGANIZATION> , which described a group of women living in a poor urban neighborhood andwas later made into a miniseries by Oprah Winfrey.But in <DATE>2005</DATE> , she published a lesser-known work , <DATE>1996</DATE> , a semi-autobiographicalbook describing her experience as a TI . 
" I did n't want to tell this story . 
It ' sgoing to take courage . 
Perhaps more courage than I possess , but they 've left meno alternatives , " <PERSON>Naylor</PERSON> writes at the beginning of her book . 
" I am in a battlefor my mind . 
If I stop now , they 'll have won , and I will lose myself . " 
The bookis coherent , if hard to believe . 
It 's also marked by disturbing passagesdescribing how Jewish American agents were responsible for <ORGANIZATION>Naylor</ORGANIZATION> ' ssurveillance . 
" Of the many cars that kept coming and going down my road , mostwere driven by Jews , " she writes in the book . 
When asked about that passage in arecent interview , she defended her logic : Being from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> , she claimed , shecan recognize Jews.Naylor lives on a quiet street in <LOCATION>Brooklyn</LOCATION> in a majestic brownstone with aninterior featuring intricate woodwork and tasteful decorations that attest to asuccessful literary career . 
She speaks about her situation calmly , occasionallylaughing at her own predicament and her struggle with what she originallythought was mental illness . 
" I would observe myself , " she explains . 
" I would liein bed while the conversations were going on , and I 'd ask : Maybe it isschizophrenia ? 
" Like <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> , <PERSON>Naylor</PERSON> describes what she calls " street theater " -- incidentsthat might be dismissed by others as coincidental , but which <ORGANIZATION>Naylor</ORGANIZATION> believeswere set up . 
She noticed suspicious cars driving by her isolated vacation home.On an airplane , fellow passengers mimicked her every movement -- like mimes ona street.Voices similar to those in <ORGANIZATION>Girard</ORGANIZATION> 's case followed -- taunting voices cursingher , telling her she was stupid , that she could n't write . 
Expletive-lacedlanguage filled her head . 
Naylor sought help from a psychiatrist and received aprescription for an antipsychotic drug . 
But the medication failed to stop thevoices , she says , which only added to her conviction that the harassment wasreal.For almost four years , <PERSON>Naylor</PERSON> says , the voices prevented her from writing . 
In2000 , she says , around the time she discovered the mind-control forums , thevoices stopped and the surveillance tapered off . 
It was then that she beganwriting <DATE>1996</DATE> as a " catharsis . 
" Colleagues urged <PERSON>Naylor</PERSON> not to publish the book , saying she would destroy herreputation . 
But she did publish , albeit with a small publishing house . 
The bookwas generally ignored by critics but embraced by TIs.Naylor is not the first writer to describe such a personal descent . 
EvelynWaugh , one of the great novelists of the <DATE>20th century</DATE> , details similarexperiences in The Ordeal of <PERSON>Gilbert Pinfold</PERSON> . 
Waugh 's book , published in <DATE>1957</DATE> , has eerie similarities to <ORGANIZATION>Naylor 's</ORGANIZATION> . 
Embarking on a recuperative cruise , <ORGANIZATION>Pinfold</ORGANIZATION> begins to hear voices on the shipthat he believes are part of a wireless system capable of broadcasting into hishead ; he believes the instigator recruited fellow passengers to act asoperatives ; and he describes " performances " put on by passengers directed at himyet meant to look innocuous to others.Waugh wrote his book several years after recovering from a similar episode andrealizing that the voices and paranoia were the result of drug-inducedhallucinations . 
<PERSON>Naylor</PERSON> , who has n't written a book since <DATE>1996</DATE> , is now back at work on anhistorical novel she hopes will return her to the literary mainstream . 
Sheremains convinced that she was targeted by mind control . 
The many echoes of herordeal she sees on the mind-control forums reassure her she 's not crazy , shesays.Of course , some of the things she sees on the forum do strike her as crazy . 
" Butwho I am to say ? " 
she says . 
" Maybe I sound crazy to somebody else . 
" SOME TIS , SUCH AS <PERSON>ED MOORE</PERSON> , A YOUNG MEDICAL DOCTOR , take a slightly moreskeptical approach . 
He criticizes what he calls the " wacky claims " of TIs whoblame various government agencies or groups of people without any proof . 
" I haveyet to see a claim of who is behind this that has any data to support it , " hewrites.Nonetheless , <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> still believes the voices in his head are the result of mindcontrol and that the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government is the most likely culprit . 
Moore startedhearing voices in <DATE>2003</DATE> , just as he completed his medical residency inanesthesiology ; he was pulling an all-nighter studying for board exams when heheard voices coming from a nearby house commenting on him , on his abilities as adoctor , on his sanity . 
At first , he thought he was simply overhearingconversations through walls ( much as <PERSON>Waugh</PERSON> 's fictional alter ego first thought ) , but when no one else could hear the voices , he realized they were in his head.Moore went through a traumatic two years , including hospitalization fordepression with auditory hallucinations . 
" One tries to convince friends and family that you are being electronicallyharassed with voices that only you can hear , " he writes in an e-mail . 
" You learnto stop doing that . 
They do n't believe you , and they become sad and concerned , and it amplifies your own depression when you have voices screaming at you andyour friends and family looking at you as a helpless , sick , mentally unbalancedwreck . 
" He says he grew frustrated with anti-psychotic medications meant to stop thevoices , both because the treatments did n't work and because psychiatrists showedno interest in what the voices were telling him . 
He began to look for some otherway to cope . 
" In <DATE>March of 2005</DATE> , I started looking up support groups on the Internet , " hewrote . 
" My wife would cry when she would see these sites , knowing I still heardvoices , but I did not know what else to do . " 
In <DATE>2006</DATE> , he says , his wife , who hadstood by him for three years , filed for divorce.Moore , like other TIs , is cautious about sharing details of his life . 
He worriesabout looking foolish to friends and colleagues -- but he says that risk isultimately worthwhile if he can bring attention to the issue.With his father 's financial help , <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> is now studying for an electricalengineering degree at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Texas</ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION>San Antonio</LOCATION> , hoping to provethat V2K , the technology to send voices into people 's heads , is real . 
Being inschool , around other people , helps him cope , he writes , but the voices continueto taunt him.Recently , he says , they told him : " We 'll never stop [ messing ] with you . 
" A WEEK BEFORE THE TIS RALLY ON THE NATIONAL MALL , <PERSON>John Alexander</PERSON> , one of thepeople whom <PERSON>Harlan Girard</PERSON> holds personally responsible for the voices in hishead , is at a <ORGANIZATION>Chili</ORGANIZATION> 's restaurant in <LOCATION>Crystal City</LOCATION> explaining over a <LOCATION>Philly</LOCATION> cheesesteak and fries why the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> needs mind-control weapons.A former Green Beret who served in <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> went on to a number ofnational security jobs , and rubbed shoulders with prominent military andpolitical leaders . 
Long known for taking an interest in exotic weapons , his 1980article , " The New Mental Battlefield , " published in the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> journal MilitaryReview , is cited by self-described victims as proof of his complicity in mindcontrol . 
Now retired from the government and living in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> , Alexandercontinues to advise the military . 
He is in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> area that day for anofficial meeting.Beneath a shock of white hair is the mind of a self-styled military thinker.Alexander belongs to a particular set of <ORGANIZATION>Pentagon</ORGANIZATION> advisers who considerthemselves defense intellectuals , focusing on big-picture issues , future threatsand new capabilities . 
Alexander 's career led him from work on sticky foam thatwould stop an enemy in his or her tracks to dalliances in paranormal studies andpsychics , which he still defends as operationally useful.In an earlier phone conversation , <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> said that in the <DATE>1990s</DATE> , when he tookpart in briefings at the <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> , there was never any talk of " mind control , ormind-altering drugs or technologies , or anything like that . 
" According to <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> , the military and intelligence agencies were still scaredby the excesses of MK-ULTRA , the infamous <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> program that involved , in part , slipping LSD to unsuspecting victims . 
" Until recently , anything that smacked of [ mind control ] was extremely dangerous " because <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> would simply take themoney away , he said.Alexander acknowledged that " there were some abuses that took place , " but addedthat , on the whole , " I would argue we threw the baby out with the bath water . 
" But <DATE>September 11 , 2001</DATE> , changed the mood in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , and some in the nationalsecurity community are again expressing interest in mind control , particularly ayounger generation of officials who were n't around for MK-ULTRA . 
" It ' sinteresting , that it 's coming back , " <PERSON>Alexander observed.While Alexander</PERSON> scoffs at the notion that he is somehow part of an elaborateplot to control people 's minds , he acknowledges support for learning how to tapinto a potential enemy 's brain . 
He gives as an example the possible use offunctional magnetic resonance imaging , or fMRI , for lie detection . 
" Brainmapping " with fMRI theoretically could allow interrogators to know when someoneis lying by watching for activity in particular parts of the brain . 
Forinterrogating terrorists , fMRI could come in handy , <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> suggests . 
But anyconceivable use of the technique would fall far short of the kind ofmind-reading TIs complain about.Alexander also is intrigued by the possibility of using electronic means tomodify behavior . 
The dilemma of the war on terrorism , he notes , is that it neverends . 
So what do you do with enemies , such as those at <LOCATION>Guantanamo</LOCATION> : keep themthere forever ? 
That 's impractical . 
Behavior modification could be analternative , he says . 
" Maybe I can fix you , or electronically neuter you , so it 's safe to release youinto society , so you wo n't come back and kill me , " <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> says . 
It 's only amatter of time before technology allows that scenario to come true , hecontinues . 
" We 're now getting to where we can do that . " 
He pauses for a momentto take a bite of his sandwich . 
" Where does that fall in the ethics spectrum?That 's a really tough question . 
" When Alexander encounters a query he does n't want to answer , such as one aboutthe ethics of mind control , he smiles and raises his hands level to his chest , as if balancing two imaginary weights . 
In one hand is mind control and thesanctity of free thought -- and in the other hand , a tad higher -- is thewar on terrorism.But none of this has anything to do with the TIs , he says . 
" Just because thingsare secret , people tend to extrapolate . 
Common sense does not prevail , and evenwhen you point out huge leaps in logic that just can not be true , they are notdissuaded . 
" WHAT IS IT THAT BRINGS SOMEONE , EVEN AN INTELLIGENT PERSON , to ascribe theexperience of hearing disembodied voices to government weapons?In her book , Abducted , <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> psychologist <PERSON>Susan Clancy</PERSON> examines a group thathas striking parallels to the TIs : people who believe they 've been kidnapped byaliens . 
The similarities are often uncanny : Would-be abductees describe strangepains , and feelings of being watched or targeted . 
And although the allegedabductees do n't generally have auditory hallucinations , they do sometimesbelieve that their thoughts are controlled by aliens , or that they 've beenimplanted with advanced technology . 
( On the online forum , some TIs posted vociferous objections to the parallel , concerned that the public finds UFOs even weirder than mind control . 
" It willkeep us all marginalized and discredited , " one griped . ) 
Clancy argues that the main reason people believe they 've been abducted byaliens is that it provides them with a compelling narrative to explain theirperception that strange things have happened to them , such as marks on theirbodies ( marks others would simply dismiss as bruises ) , stimulation to theirsexual organs ( as the TIs describe ) or feelings of paranoia . 
" It 's not just anexplanation for your problems ; it 's a source of meaning for your life , " Clancysays.In the case of TIs , mind-control weapons are an explanation for the voices theyhear in their head . 
Socrates heard a voice and thought it was a demon ; <PERSON>Joan ofArc</PERSON> heard voices from God . 
As one TI noted in an e-mail : " Each person undergoingthis harassment is looking for the solution to the problem . 
Each person analyzesit through his or her own particular spectrum of beliefs . 
If you are ascientific-minded person , then you will probably analyze the situation from thatperspective and conclude it must be done with some kind of electronic devices.If you are a religious person , you will see it as a struggle between theelements of whatever religion you believe in . 
If you are maybe , perhaps moreeccentric , you may think that it is alien in nature . 
" Or , if you happen to live in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> in the early <DATE>21st century</DATE> , youmay fear the growing power of the <ORGANIZATION>NSA</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>CIA</ORGANIZATION> and FBI.Being a victim of government surveillance is also , arguably , better than beinginsane . 
In <PERSON>Waugh</PERSON> 's novella based on his own painful experience , when <PERSON>Pinfoldconcludes</PERSON> that hidden technology is being used to infiltrate his brain , he " feltnothing but gratitude in his discovery . " 
Why ? 
" He might be unpopular ; he mightbe ridiculous ; but he was not mad . 
" <PERSON>Ralph Hoffman</PERSON> , a professor of psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION>Yale</ORGANIZATION> who has studied auditoryhallucinations , regularly sees people who believe the voices are a part ofgovernment harassment ( others believe they are God , dead relatives or evenex-girlfriends ) . 
Not all people who hear voices are schizophrenic , he says , noting that people can hear voices episodically in highly emotional states . 
Whatexactly causes these voices is still unknown , but one thing is certain : Peoplewho think the voices are caused by some external force are rarely dissuaded fromtheir delusional belief , he says . 
" These are highly emotional and grippingexperiences that are so compelling for them that ordinary reality seems bland . 
" Perhaps because the experience is so vivid , he says , even some of those whoimprove through treatment merely decide the medical regimen somehow helpedprotect their brain from government weapons.Scott <ORGANIZATION>Temple</ORGANIZATION> , a professor of psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State University</ORGANIZATION> who has beeninvolved in two recent studies of auditory hallucinations , notes that those whosuffer such hallucinations frequently lack insight into their illness . 
Evenamong those who do understand they are sick , " that awareness comes and goes , " hesays . 
" People feel overwhelmed , and the delusional interpretations return . 
" BACK AT THE <LOCATION>PHILADELPHIA</LOCATION> TRAIN STATION , <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> seems more agitated . 
In a meetingthe week before , his " handlers " had spoken to him only briefly -- they were n'tin the right position to attack him , <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> surmises , based on the lack ofvoices . 
Today , his conversation jumps more rapidly from one subject to the next : victims of radiation experiments , his hatred of <PERSON>George H.W. Bush</PERSON> , MK-ULTRA , hispersonal experiences.Asked about his studies at <LOCATION>Penn</LOCATION> , he replies by talking about his problems withreading : " I told you , everything I write they dictate to me , " he says , referringagain to the voices . 
" When I read , they 're reading to me . 
My eyes go across ; they 're moving my eyes down the line . 
They 're reading it to me . 
When I close thebook , I ca n't remember a thing I read . 
That 's why they do it . 
" The week before , <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> had pointed to only one person who appeared suspiciousto him -- a young African American man reading a book ; this time , however , hehears more voices , which leads him to believe the station is crawling withagents . 
" Let 's change our location , " <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> says after a while . 
" I 'm sure they have 40or 50 people in here today . 
I escaped their surveillance last time -- theywo n't let that happen again . 
" Asked to explain the connection between mind control and <ORGANIZATION>the University ofPennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> , which <ORGANIZATION>Girard</ORGANIZATION> alleges is involved in the conspiracy , he begins totalk about defense contractors located near the <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> campus : " GeneralElectric was right next to the parking garage ; <ORGANIZATION>General Electric Space Systemsoccupies</ORGANIZATION> a huge building right over there . 
From that building , you could seeinto the studio where I was doing my work most of the time . 
I asked somebodywhat they were doing there . 
You know , it had to do with computers . 
GE SpaceSystems . 
They were supposed to be tracking missile debris from this location . 
. 
. 
pardon me . 
What was your question again ? 
" Yet many parts of <ORGANIZATION>Girard</ORGANIZATION> 's life seem to reflect that of any affluent 70-year-oldbachelor . 
He travels frequently to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> for extended vacations and takes partin French cultural activities in <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> . 
He has set up a travelscholarship at the <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Institute of Art</ORGANIZATION> in the name of his late mother , who attended school there ( he changed his last name 27 years ago for " personalreasons " ) , and he travels to meet the students who benefit from the fund . 
Andwhile the bulk of his time is spent on his research and writing about mindcontrol , he has other interests . 
He follows politics and describes outings withfriends and family members with whom he does n't talk about mind control , knowingthey would view it skeptically.Girard acknowledges that some of his experiences mirror symptoms ofschizophrenia , but asked if he ever worried that the voices might in fact becaused by mental illness , he answers sharply with one word : " No . 
" How , then , does he know the voices are real ? 
" How do you know you know anything ? " 
<PERSON>Girard</PERSON> replies . 
" How do you know I exist?How do you know this is n't a dream you 're having , from which you 'll wake up in afew minutes ? 
I suppose that analogy is the closest thing : You know when you havea dream . 
Sometimes it could be perfectly lucid , but you know it 's a dream . 
" The very " realness " of the voices is the issue -- how do you disbelievesomething you perceive as real ? 
That 's precisely what <PERSON>Hoffman</PERSON> , the Yalepsychiatrist , points out : So lucid are the voices that the sufferers -- regardless of their educational level or self-awareness -- are unable to seethem as anything but real . 
" One thing I can assure you , " <PERSON>Hoffman</PERSON> says , " is thatfor them , it feels real . 
" IT LOOKS ALMOST LIKE ANY OTHER SMALL POLITICAL RALLY IN <LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> . 
Postersadorn the gate on the southwest side of the Capitol Reflecting Pool , asattendees set up a table with press materials , while volunteers test aloudspeaker and set out coolers filled with bottled water . 
The sun is out , theweather is perfect , and an eclectic collection of people from across the countryhas gathered to protest mind control.There is not a tinfoil hat to be seen . 
Only the posters and paraphernalia hintat the unusual . 
" Stop <ORGANIZATION>USA</ORGANIZATION> electronic harassment , " urges one poster . 
" DirectedEnergy Assaults , " reads another . 
Smaller signs in the shape of tombstones say , " RIP MKULTRA . " 
The main display , set in front of the speaker 's lectern has amore extended message : " HELP STOP HI-TECH ASSAULT PSYCHOTRONIC TORTURE . 
" About 35 TIs show up for the <DATE>June</DATE> rally , in addition to a few friends and familymembers . 
Speakers alternate between giving personal testimonials anddescriptions of research into mind-control technology . 
Most of the gawkers atthe rally are foreign tourists . 
A few hecklers snicker at the signs , but mostlypeople are either confused or indifferent . 
The articles on mind control at thetable -- from mainstream news magazines -- go untouched . 
" How can you expect people to get worked up over this if they do n't care abouteavesdropping or eminent domain ? " 
one man challenges after stopping to flipthrough the literature . 
<PERSON>Mary Ann Stratton</PERSON> , who is manning the table , merelyshrugs and smiles sadly . 
There is no answer : Everyone at the rally acknowledgesit is an uphill battle.In general , the outlook for TIs is not good ; many lose their jobs , houses andfamily . 
Depression is common . 
But for many at the rally , experiencing thecommunity of mind-control victims seems to help . 
One TI , a man who had been arescue swimmer in the <ORGANIZATION>Coast Guard</ORGANIZATION> before voices in his head sent him on adownward spiral , expressed the solace he found among fellow TIs in a long e-mailto another TI : " I think that the only people that can help are people goingthrough the same thing . 
Everyone else will not believe you , or they are possiblyinvolved . 
" In the end , though , nothing could help him enough . 
In <DATE>August 2006</DATE> , he wouldcommit suicide.But at least for the day , the rally is boosting TI spirits . 
<PERSON>Girard</PERSON> , in what forhim is an ebullient mood , takes the microphone . 
A small crowd of touristsgathers at the sidelines , listening with casual interest . 
With the Capitollooming behind him , he reaches the crescendo of his speech , rallying theattendees to remember an important thing : They are part of a single community . 
" I 've heard it said , ' We ca n't get anywhere because everyone 's story isdifferent . ' 
We are all the same , " <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> booms . 
" You knew someone with the powerto commit you to the electronic concentration camp system . 
" Several weeks after the rally , <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> shows up for a meeting with a reporter atthe stately <ORGANIZATION>Mayflower Hotel</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , where he has stayed frequently overthe two decades he has traveled to the capital to battle mind control . 
He walksin with a lit cigarette , which he apologetically puts out after a hotel employeetells him smoking is n't allowed anymore . 
He is half an hour late -- delayed , he says , by a meeting on Capitol Hill . 
Wearing a monogrammed dress shirt andtie , he looks , as always , serious and professional.Girard declines to mention whom on Capitol Hill he 'd met with , other than to sayit was a congressional staffer . 
Embarrassment is likely a factor : Girard readilyacknowledges that most people he meets with , ranging from scholars topoliticians , ignore his entreaties or dismiss him as a lunatic.Lately , his focus is on his Web site , which he sees as the culmination of nearlya quarter-century of research . 
When completed , it will contain more than 300pages of documents . 
What next ? 
Maybe he 'll move to <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> ( there are victimsthere , too ) , or maybe the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government will finally just kill him , he says.Meanwhile , he is always searching for absolute proof that the government hasdecoded the brain . 
His latest interest is LifeLog , a project once funded by thePentagon that he read about in <ORGANIZATION>Wired News</ORGANIZATION> . 
The article described it this way : " The embryonic LifeLog program would dump everything an individual does into agiant database : every e-mail sent or received , every picture taken , every Webpage surfed , every phone call made , every TV show watched , every magazine read.All of this -- and more -- would combine with information gleaned from avariety of sources : a GPS transmitter to keep tabs on where that person went , audiovisual sensors to capture what he or she sees or says , and biomedicalmonitors to keep track of the individual 's health . 
" <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> suggests that the government , using similar technology , has " catalogued " his life over the past two years -- every sight and sound ( <PERSON>Evelyn Waugh</PERSON> , inhis mind-control book , writes about his character 's similar fear that hisharassers were creating a file of his entire life ) . 
Girard thinks the government can control his movements , inject thoughts into hishead , cause him pain day and night . 
He believes that he will die a victim ofmind control.Is there any reason for optimism?Girard hesitates , then asks a rhetorical question . 
" Why , despite all this , why am I the same person ? 
Why am I <PERSON>Harlan Girard</PERSON> ? 
" For all his anguish , be it the result of mental illness or , as <PERSON>Girard</PERSON> contends , government mind control , the voices have n't managed to conquer the thing thatmakes him who he is : Call it his consciousness , his intellect or , perhaps , hissoul . 
" That 's what they do n't yet have , " he says . 
After 22 years , " I 'm still me .
