Clenched , curled , the surgeon 's fingers struggle to knot his tie . 
At last , hegrips the loop and hastily feeds the burgundy tip through with his small , pudgyfingers . 
" It 's a kind of torture , " says <PERSON>Juan Romagoza Arce</PERSON> , with a wry , quiet laugh as heprepares for another hectic day at his <LOCATION>Northwest Washington</LOCATION> health clinic.Buttons are even worse . 
" It 's hard to feel them here , " the doctor says , tappingthe tip of his index finger on his thumb.There is a reason why the fingers that once wove sutures now strain to knot atie . 
Why the doctor who once performed emergency surgery now winces at the sightof blood . 
Why the executive director of <ORGANIZATION>La Clinica del Pueblo</ORGANIZATION> , a health careoasis for <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 's Hispanic community , does n't treat patients.More than two decades have passed since <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> fled <PERSON>El Salvador</PERSON> , yet it stillis n't easy for him to talk about the torture he endured or the damage it did.For a long time , the words were too painful , the memories too searing , thehealing too precarious . 
Then he was asked to tell his story publicly , in anAmerican courtroom , as part of what many people considered a quixotic legaleffort to hold his torturers accountable for what they 'd done to him . 
And whatthey 'd done to El Salvador.Romagoza rubs his left arm , which bears a faint brown bullet scar , the onlyvisible mark his tormentors left . 
" I love clinical work , I love surgery , but itis impossible for me , " he says , peering down his glasses . 
He takes out a yellowlegal pad and pencil . 
" Let me show you , " he says in his choppy English . 
" When they broke this bone . 
. 
. " 
He sketches a bent arm and pencils in the nerves , a twisted composition ofmatted lines . 
When the nerves are cut , he explains , " there 's less tension . 
Thetissue is pulled " like a <DATE>spring</DATE> . 
He touches his arm again . 
" My surgery is n't as precise as it was in the past , but I think that mylimitation is more emotional , psychological . 
It is more related to . . . " Hepauses thoughtfully . 
" Impotence . 
Fear . 
Stress . 
" They stripped me of my gift . 
" Romagoza was n't surprised to learn " they " were here . 
By the time <ORGANIZATION>El Salvador</ORGANIZATION> ' scivil war finally ended in <DATE>1992</DATE> , many members of the military elite -- thepeople who presided over the torture and murder of thousands of guerrillas andsuspected leftist sympathizers -- had chosen the same haven he had : the UnitedStates . 
Two of the military officers who ruled <ORGANIZATION>El Salvador</ORGANIZATION> during Romagoza ' sordeal -- Gen. <PERSON>Jose Guillermo Garcia</PERSON> and future general <PERSON>Carlos Eugenio VidesCasanova</PERSON> -- had retired to <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> , joining their children who were alreadyliving there . 
That made sense , <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> says , given their close ties to U.S.officials throughout the <DATE>1980s</DATE> . 
" Where else are they supposed to live ? " 
asks <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> , who turns 52 this weekand is now a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizen . 
" In El Salvador ? 
No . 
In another Central Americacountry ? 
No . 
They had an open door to come here . 
" In fact , <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> and a handful of other states are home to hundredsof accused war criminals and torturers from all over <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> , according toAmnesty International , a human rights group . 
Other suspected human rightsabusers have made their way to the <ORGANIZATION>United States</ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION>Cambodia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Sierra Leone</PERSON> , <LOCATION>Vietnam</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Somalia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Eastern Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> , sometimes settling in the same communities as their victims . 
( Torture treatmentcenters and refugee groups claim there are roughly 500,000 torture survivorsnationwide , with an estimated 40,000 in the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> area . ) 
Vides Casanova andGarcia received <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> visas in <DATE>1989</DATE> after retiring from the military ; Garcia wasgranted political asylum on the grounds that he and his children had beenthreatened during the war . 
<PERSON>Vides Casanova</PERSON> was allowed to enter the countrydespite a <DATE>1983</DATE> report to the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> that he was likely " aware of , andfor a time acquiesced in , the coverup " of the murders of four Americanchurchwomen.It was through the deaths of the churchwomen that <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> came to confront hispast.Romagoza knew , of course , about the three nuns and the Catholic lay worker whohad distributed food and health supplies to local campesinos , or peasants . 
Onthe evening of <DATE>December 2 , 1980</DATE> , they were stopped by the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> outsideSan Salvador , the country 's capital . 
They were raped and killed , their bodiesdumped into a shallow grave.The women had been dead for 18 years when <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> got a phone call from an oldfriend , <PERSON>Shawn Roberts</PERSON> , the lawyer who had helped him win permanent residency inthe <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Roberts</PERSON> , who worked for the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Justice</ORGANIZATION> andAccountability , in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> , wanted <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> to join a civil lawsuit beingbrought by the families of the dead churchwomen against <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> and VidesCasanova.Romagoza initially agreed to be part of any legal effort to take on thegenerals , then began having second thoughts . 
He lay awake in his small NorthwestWashington rowhouse , which he shares with a niece studying at <ORGANIZATION>Howard University</ORGANIZATION> , and agonized over what to do.He felt safe there , in that house with its Central American pottery and itssmall garden of radishes , corn and peppers that reminded him of the one at hisfamily 's home in <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> . 
On <DATE>summer</DATE> weekends , he 'd doze in a hammock in theback yard , savoring the sun and the chance to sleep . 
But his sense of securityin the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> did not extend to his mother , his siblings and his in-lawsin <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> , where the military continued to wield tremendous power . 
Hisfamily had already warned him not to get involved.Yet he felt a sense of obligation -- to the churchwomen , who 'd given their livesfor the Salvadoran people , and to all the others who had suffered at themilitary 's hands . 
If he did n't have the courage to confront the generals , whowould?He stuck with the case , which was eventually split into two separate lawsuits , one for the churchwomen , the other for Salvadoran torture victims . 
Two othervictims had signed on with <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> : <PERSON>Carlos Mauricio</PERSON> , an agriculture professorwho 'd been beaten with a rubber-covered metal bar , and <PERSON>Neris Gonzalez</PERSON> , a motherof two who was abducted when she was pregnant ( and lost her unborn child afterbeing tortured ) . 
None of the torture victims knew how much of a role they 'd playin the legal drama about to unfold . 
The churchwomen 's case was first , and theirlawyers had compiled a mountain of evidence.The families did n't accuse the generals of actually committing the murders ; instead , they charged that torture and murder were endemic to their militaryleadership . 
They also cited the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations Truth Commission</ORGANIZATION> report on ElSalvador that concluded the generals impeded the investigation of the murders.The trial , held in <LOCATION>West Palm Beach</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION> , in the <DATE>fall of 2000</DATE> , lasted a monthand ended with exoneration for the generals . 
The jury acquitted both men of " command responsibility , " and found them individually not responsible for thechurchwomen 's murder . 
But any celebration by the generals was quickly chilled bythe prospect of a second trial . 
And this time the generals would be face to facewith their accusers.The letters were scary , the calls even more so . 
Remember that you will return toEl Salvador someday , the first letter warned <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> . 
Remember you have familyin <ORGANIZATION>El Salvador</ORGANIZATION> . 
Later , anonymous callers delivered an even more chillingmessage : If you were n't happy with your rape in <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> , we will rape youhere . 
We will find you in the street . 
We know where you live.In <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> 's mother was so afraid for her safety that she stoppedvisiting church in the morning . 
By the time testimony got underway in <ORGANIZATION>U.S.District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>West Palm Beach</LOCATION> on <DATE>June 24 , 2002</DATE> , <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> had sufferedthrough months of anxiety and sleeplessness . 
" Plaintiffs may call your first witness . 
" Romagoza made his way to the stand , his throat tight and his face strained . 
Hepulled the microphone toward his mouth . 
<PERSON>Jose Guillermo Garcia</PERSON> , 68 , and <PERSON>CarlosEugenio Vides Casanova</PERSON> , 64 , once two of the most powerful men in <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> , sat directly in front of him . 
Garcia was defense minister from <DATE>1979</DATE> to <DATE>1983</DATE> , when he was succeeded by <PERSON>Vides Casanova</PERSON> , who 'd been head of the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard.One of Romagoza</ORGANIZATION> 's lawyers , <PERSON>James Green</PERSON> , asked about his background , his medicaltraining , his faith.Then , " Dr. <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> , were you politically involved as a student or medicalstudent ? 
" No . 
" Were you ever a guerrilla ? " 
" Never . " 
" Directing your attention to <DATE>December 12 , 1980</DATE> , what were you doing ? 
" He glanced at the generals , then explained he was part of a group that organizedhealth campaigns in northern <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> , where peasants badly needed medicalhelp . 
They went to provinces like <LOCATION>Chalatenango</LOCATION> , in one of the zonas rojas , or " red zones " -- areas where the fighting was the most intense , and where themilitary exercised martial law.December 12 was the feast day of the Virgin of <LOCATION>Guadalupe</LOCATION> , and local people wouldbe attending <LOCATION>Mass</LOCATION> . 
In the hope that people already gathered would be more likelyto take advantage of medical care , six health workers -- doctors , nurses , medical students -- traveled to the town of <LOCATION>Santa Anita</LOCATION> . 
It was only 10 daysafter the murder of the churchwomen . 
" Were you carrying a gun ? " 
" Never . " 
" Was anyone with you carrying a gun ? 
" No.Romagoza 's group , he testified , attended Mass , then got to work , providingmedical exams , inoculations , minor surgery . 
Soon a line snaked alongside thechurch in the town square . 
" What happened then ? 
" A truck carrying <ORGANIZATION>National Guardsmen</ORGANIZATION> arrived . 
Romagoza assured the crowd theguardsmen would leave . 
" We were trying to calm them down , saying , You know , theywill be here , but they will leave . 
But it was n't that way . . . " The guardsmen opened fire , emptying their machine guns into the crowd.People scattered , but the wounded were pinned down . 
Romagoza touched hisforehead and felt blood pouring from his head . 
He looked down and saw his bootripped open by shrapnel , now lodged in his foot.A guardsman walked over to him and pressed the barrel of his gun againstRomagoza 's temple . 
He heard a click ! 
And again , click-click ! 
The safety was on.The guardsman kicked <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> in the chest , then inspected his bag , with knives , forceps and needles . 
The equipment and his boots -- hiking shoes of the sortworn by Salvadoran Eagle Scouts -- apparently made them suspect <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> was aguerrilla commander . 
They took him , first by truck , and then by helicopter , to agarrison at <LOCATION>El Paraiso</LOCATION> , Spanish for " paradise . " 
" All they said was they were going to take me in , and I was about to go throughsome of the most difficult days of my life , " <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> said . 
" I asked them tokill me right then , since I knew what was going to happen to me . 
" A child of middle-class parents , <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION>Usulutan</LOCATION> , a farmingcommunity in southeastern El Salvador sandwiched between mountains and a slopingvolcano . 
His father was a sports coach and physical education teacher . 
Thefamily lived in a two-story Spanish colonial house , with thick walls thatwithstood earthquakes while others near it crumbled.Romagoza 's parents wanted him to become a priest , and sent him to seminary whenhe was 12 . 
But <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> had a different dream : medicine , an interest fueled byseeing his grandfather die of a heart attack at 58 and watching childhoodfriends die of malnutrition and parasitic diseases.Romagoza wanted to be a surgeon , but such ambitions seemed out of reach . 
He wasone of eight children , and medical school was costly . 
But <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> had twouncles in the military , both colonels , who had connections . 
One of them , Lt.Col . 
<PERSON>Manuel Rafael Arce Blandon</PERSON> , was once the country 's economics minister , andhe helped his nephew get a medical scholarship.In <DATE>1970</DATE> at age 19 , <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> enrolled at the <ORGANIZATION>University of El Salvador</ORGANIZATION> in SanSalvador , where he eventually hoped to specialize in cardiac surgery . 
Instead hefound himself caught up in <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> 's increasing unrest . 
A guerrilla movementwas growing , inspired by the success of <LOCATION>Nicaragua</LOCATION> 's Sandinistas , and the statewas intent on crushing it . 
The government 's hard-liners were supported by theUnited States , still fighting the Cold War and determined to preventrevolutionary , Cuban-style socialism from spreading across <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> . 
TheUnited States provided the Salvadoran government with arms , military trainingand <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> in aid.By the late <DATE>1970s</DATE> , <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> -- a country roughly the size of <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> , with just 5 million people -- was on the brink of civil war . 
Though he had n'tyet finished medical school ( and would not until <DATE>1994</DATE> ) , <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> had alreadybegun to perform surgery in the field . 
" People did n't go to the hospital , " he explains . 
" They died in the streets , theydied in the church , they died in the school . . . I did a lot of surgery at thattime . 
" The woman he would eventually marry , <PERSON>Laura Maria Melindas</PERSON> , was treating peoplecaught in the crossfire , too . 
She was a year behind him in medical school andboth were inspired by <ORGANIZATION>El Salvador</ORGANIZATION> 's archbishop , <PERSON>Oscar Romero</PERSON> , who became a heroto millions in <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> by openly challenging <ORGANIZATION>El Salvador</ORGANIZATION> 's ruling class.Before he was silenced by an assassin 's bullet on <DATE>March 24 , 1980</DATE> , <PERSON>Romero</PERSON> helpedestablish groups that promoted land reform and workers ' rights . 
He also calledon medical students to treat the country 's rural poor , who were being swept intoa brutal , chaotic conflict . 
Romagoza and Melindas heeded the call , though it wasincreasingly dangerous to do so.At the university 's clinic , people began showing up with burns , lesions andtrack marks from electric shock instruments . 
Some had been raped with metalinstruments , others beaten over and over again . 
Romagoza says he treated about30 torture victims in <DATE>1979</DATE> and <DATE>1980</DATE> . 
Their physical scars and bruises werealways accompanied by " psychosomatic problems " and " much emotional trouble . " 
" There was a standard among them all , " <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> says , " which was a terrible fearof everything . 
" At <LOCATION>El Paraiso</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> was stripped to his underwear , strapped to a cementtable and blindfolded . 
" Suddenly these voices appeared , and they started questioning me , and eachquestion was accompanied by a blow , " <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> testified . 
" When they did n'treceive the answers they wanted , that is when the blows came , and the electricalshocks . 
" The next day he was moved to <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION> . 
Hisguards joked about taking him to the best hotel in the country . 
His roommeasured roughly four by four feet . 
No toilet , no running water.He slept only about 150 feet from <PERSON>Vides Casanova</PERSON> 's office , as he would laterfind out from schematic drawings of the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> compound . 
His ankles weretied with thick ropes.Once again , the interrogation began . 
The same questions were repeated : Why washe with those people ? 
Who were the other doctors helping those people ? 
Moreblows followed . 
Then more shocks.In the wood-paneled <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> courtroom , the doctor recounted the details withoutemotion as a hushed jury absorbed his words . 
But he was not really there , hesaid later . 
He could not recognize his own voice . 
The courtroom had receded , replaced by the torture chamber.At night , he could hear the screams of other men and women being tortured.Meager portions of tortillas and beans were the only nourishment . 
Romagoza ' swounds were left untreated . 
" I feel I am once again thrown on the floor naked , waiting for the next blow , " he told the jurors , " waiting for the next electrical shock . . . When is itgoing to come ? " 
" Do you remember <DATE>Christmas Day 1980</DATE> ? 
" It was the first Christmas that <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> had ever been away from his family . 
Heand his wife now had a baby daughter , also named <PERSON>Laura</PERSON> . 
They did n't know wherehe was -- only that he had disappeared . 
" That Christmas I had wanted to take my little girl to visit my mother , " hetestified . 
Instead , " on <DATE>Christmas</DATE> when they were drunk , and on New Year 's whenthey were drunk , torture was harsher , and it would vary . 
" Blows and shocks increased each day . 
" The electric shocks . . . were almost likeour daily bread . " 
Alligator clips were clamped on every part of his body -- histongue , testicles , anus , breasts and the edges of his wounds . 
Eventually hepassed out from the pain . 
Then they would wake him with water and continuetorturing him until he defecated.One of the defendants , he told the jury , visited him in his cell . 
" They would call him the big boss . 
They would say the colonel . " 
" And who was that ? 
" <PERSON>Vides Casanova</PERSON> , director of the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard.The</ORGANIZATION> day of the visit , they cleaned <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> 's wounds and blindfolded him . 
Hecould tell that this interrogation would be different from the others . 
A silencefell over the room -- there was n't the usual chatter among guards . 
Footstepsadvanced , and a familiar voice began to ask questions . 
" Could you , " <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> 's lawyer asked , " see anything at all of the person who wasinterrogating you ? 
" Yes . 
" What could you see ? " 
" I could see his boots , his trousers and the buckle to his belt . " 
" Were the boots shined ? " 
" Very shined . " 
His clothing was of a much higher quality than regular guardswore . 
And his voice -- who could forget it ? 
That voice was everywhere on TV andradio . 
Everyone in <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> knew the voice of Col. <PERSON>Vides</PERSON> Casanova.The voice asked him about his connection to his uncles . 
The voice joked thatRomagoza was almost dead -- that he stank of death . 
" After the colonel visited you , did your treatment change ? 
" Yes . 
" Did it become better , or worse ? " 
" It was worse . . . " " Were you ever hung from ropes or pulleys ? 
" They called it the plane . 
They took him to a room where they hung him by hishands . 
Sometimes they would suspend him by his legs . 
He was raped as he hungthere . 
" They introduced a stick . . . " And it was there , while he was hanging , that they shot him in the middle of his left forearm . 
" They told me that was the mark they made for having helped those people . 
Andthey said that for the rest of my life I would bear the mark of a leftist , andthat I would never again do what I had been doing there . 
" The bullet severed nerves , limiting motion and sensation in his thumb and middleand index fingers . 
Bleeding , he was still suspended by wires that dug into hishands . 
He tried to pull himself up to ease the pain , but this tightened thewires , and buried them deeper inside his fingers . 
" They tightened so much they went halfway through my fingers , " he said , hisvoice cracking . 
" I 've lost feeling in three fingers in my right hand . 
" Romagoza 's eyes swelled with tears . 
" They were quite right , I would never everpractice surgery . 
I will never again be able to help people in such a way . 
" After three weeks of torture , the guards took <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> to a room filled withcoffins . 
They placed him inside one barely big enough to hold his body . 
Hewaited two days inside the coffin before a guardsman came for him . 
This timethere were no guns , no blows , no threats . 
His two high-ranking military uncleshad managed to intercede . 
" A guardsman pulled me out of the box and handed me over to the arms of myuncle , who carried me to his car . " 
" As you were leaving did you see anyone else ? " 
" I saw my uncle , Colonel <PERSON>Mejia Arce</PERSON> , next to Colonel Vides Casanova . " 
" Do you see Colonel , now <ORGANIZATION>General</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Vides Casanova</PERSON> in the courtroom today ? 
" Romagoza pointed to the man seated directly in front of him . 
" That man , " he said . 
" The one in the middle . 
" Shoulders hunched , <PERSON>Vides Casanova</PERSON> stirred uncomfortably for a moment in his darksuit . 
" And are you positive that that is the same voice that you heard from thecolonel back in the torture chamber in late <DATE>1980</DATE> , early <DATE>1981</DATE> ? " 
" Almost <PERCENT>90 percent</PERCENT> sure , yes . 
" Romagoza later came to wonder if his torture was protracted not because of apair of boots and a medical bag , but because the military suspected that he andhis prominent uncles were passing weapons to the guerrillas . 
<ORGANIZATION>National Guardsmen</ORGANIZATION> , and <PERSON>Vides Casanova</PERSON> in particular , pressed Romagoza repeatedly about this . 
Whyelse , they may have thought , would a doctor with two high-ranking uncles , bothcolonels , be caring for the poor in a militarized zone ? 
" When you were released , how did you feel ? " 
" As if I had been born again . " 
" Were you able to walk ? 
" No . 
" How much did you weigh ? 
" After 24 days of detention , he weighed about 70 pounds , down from 120 . 
He hadlost a great deal of blood , and badly needed a doctor . 
His neglected wounds wereinfected ; some had worms in them . 
But friends turned him away , " because theywere afraid for what could happen to them if they helped me . " 
Even his familywould not allow him to stay with them.He had to leave <ORGANIZATION>El Salvador</ORGANIZATION> . 
Not just for his own sake , but for his family 's . 
" That part , leaving El Salvador , was the worst , " says <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> , whose wiferemained behind , determined to continue working in the red zones . 
He understoodher decision . 
What she was doing , he says , " was necessary at that time . 
Theyneeded a doctor there , and she was a good doctor . " 
Romagoza was spirited intoGuatemala on a truck loaded with onions . 
From there , he made his way to MexicoCity , which had become a haven for thousands of Central American refugees . 
Helived with Salvadorans from his home town of <LOCATION>Usulutan</LOCATION> in a modest two-storyhouse near the airport . 
They nicknamed it the " <ORGANIZATION>Usulutan Embassy</ORGANIZATION> , " because therewere sometimes as many as 15 people crowded into three small rooms . 
Most of themhad scars , though they did n't share what they 'd been through . 
" We would talk about politics , not our trauma , " <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> says . 
" We would n't talkabout it . 
We dealt with it with alcohol.Psychologically , it was very hard . 
You wanted to cry , but could n't . 
" Romagoza worked as an accountant at a restaurant ; on weekends he volunteered ata nearby clinic . 
He and his housemates tended a small garden behind their houseand bred rabbits , which they butchered and sold to support themselves . 
At themarket , Mexican neighbors who knew they were displaced Salvadorans would offerfree fruits and vegetables . 
" The Mexican people were beautiful and wonderful , " <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> says . 
The Mexicanpolice were a different matter . 
Wearing civilian clothes , they would approachSalvadoran refugees and ask for documents , threatening deportation . 
A bribewould buy Salvadorans the right to remain in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> , but such encounters alwaysheightened their fears.As economic conditions in <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> worsened and police harassment increased , hundreds of refugees began heading to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> . 
Romagoza joined them , deciding to cross the border with a group of Guatemalans . 
He and 14 others hidin a farmhouse , then hiked through the desert at dark , evading border guards.Ten hours after setting out , they arrived in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> at daybreak , on <DATE>April23 , 1983</DATE> . 
Romagoza wound up in <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> , where he found work as a janitor . 
He did n'tspeak much English , and it felt strange to be living in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , whichwas supporting the very people who had tortured him . 
Ordinary Americans , herealized , did n't understand their government 's role in <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> 's civil war . 
" I was surprised by how little people knew about what was happening outsidetheir [ borders ] , " <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> says . 
" People did n't know too much about the war inCentral <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> -- all they knew were ' communists ' . . . That was a shock.Because I suffered the consequences " of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> policies.Back then , the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service</ORGANIZATION> was denying politicalasylum to nearly all Salvadorans . 
Some were even deported.Though he was illegal himself , <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> became active in the sanctuary movement , pushing to change <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> policies toward <LOCATION>Central America</LOCATION> and its refugees . 
He wasattending a movement conference in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> in <DATE>1986</DATE> when he stumbled upon LaClinica del Pueblo . 
Situated on the third floor of a red-brick building inColumbia Heights , the clinic was open only <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> nights and was struggling tostay afloat . 
But the Salvadoran community around it was vibrant and growing.Salvadoran street vendors sold sliced mangoes and tortillas outside the clinic , and the neighborhood was home to men and women from <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> 's home town.Instead of returning to <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> , he volunteered at the clinic for sixmonths . 
In <DATE>1987</DATE> , he joined full time . 
He could n't treat patients , but he tookmedical histories , translated for doctors , cleaned and did whatever else wasneeded.There was a huge demand for <ORGANIZATION>La Clinica</ORGANIZATION> 's services . 
Though they were thousands ofmiles from <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> , many immigrants still cringed at the sight of a policecar . 
Some would n't open the door to the mailman because his uniform remindedthem of the military . 
Some did n't go to the hospital or send their children toschool because the <ORGANIZATION>INS</ORGANIZATION> might find them there and deport them . 
Their pervasivefear -- that " terrible fear of everything " -- produced persistent headaches , gastric difficulties , depression and hypertension , <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> says.He suffered from many of the same symptoms . 
But he was finally working at aclinic again , doing exactly what he 'd done in El Salvador : serving his country ' spoor.Romagoza did n't really know his wife and daughter anymore . 
More than seven yearshad passed since he 'd seen them . 
By <DATE>1987</DATE> , they were living in <LOCATION>Los Filos</LOCATION> , roughly15 miles from <LOCATION>Santa Anita</LOCATION> , the town where <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> had been abducted.Laura <LOCATION>Maria</LOCATION> had never stopped delivering medical care to <ORGANIZATION>El Salvador</ORGANIZATION> 's peasants.It was a mission she and <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> both believed in , but his long exile haddistanced them . 
Now even phone calls were difficult . 
" Eventually we communicatedonly through letters , " <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> says , " and in some way we decided to separate . 
" Then one day in <DATE>1988</DATE> , a friend from <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION> called Romagoza at the clinic.Did he know , the friend asked , that his daughter was now living with hermother 's family and that his wife was missing?Romagoza 's heart sank . 
He called his mother-in-law . 
" And she told me . . . " In Los Filos and the surrounding areas , the military had been stepping up theircounterinsurgency efforts . 
They called their strategy " quitarle el agua al pez , " draining the sea from the fish . 
By destroying the guerrillas ' support networksand killing their sympathizers , they would make it more difficult for the rebelsto operate . 
Los Filos residents fled the area rather than risk being caught upin the military sweeps . 
But <PERSON>Laura Maria</PERSON> returned to town to get medical suppliesthat were hastily left behind . 
After the sweeps were over , friends found herbody . 
She 'd been raped and then hacked with machetes.Romagoza 's daughter , <PERSON>Laura</PERSON> , was 8 years old . 
She went to live with her mother ' sfamily , first in <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION> , then in <LOCATION>Puebla</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> . 
Romagoza occasionallycalls <PERSON>Laura</PERSON> , now in her twenties and studying child psychology , and travels toMexico every year or so to see her . 
But he always stays in a hotel during hisvisits , rather than with his in-laws . 
To this day , he says , they blame him forLaura <ORGANIZATION>Maria</ORGANIZATION> 's death . 
If it were n't for him , they say , she would never have begunworking in the red zones.He understands their anger , but does n't feel responsible for <ORGANIZATION>Laura Maria</ORGANIZATION> ' sdeath . 
" I knew she would say no if I asked her to leave El Salvador , " he says . 
" In some way , we thought : I will live here and she will live there , and once thewar is over , we would get together and be a family again . " 
" General <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> , you became minister of defense on or about <DATE>October 15 , 1979</DATE> , correct ? " 
" Yes , yes , that is so . 
" Wrinkled , graying and grandfatherly , <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> had taken the witness stand in hisdefense . 
Romagoza watched from the plaintiffs ' table with mixed emotions . 
Partof him hated this man and <PERSON>Vides Casanova</PERSON> . 
They were , he would say later , " thearchitects of the terror that all of us were crushed by . " 
But part of him alsofelt sorry for them , especially <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> , who reminded <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> of his father.Once the most powerful men in the country , they 'd been " abandoned by theirmasters . 
" Romagoza was right . 
Hardly anyone had shown up to support <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> or VidesCasanova . 
No one from the Salvadoran government or military testified on theirbehalf . 
Only one former <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> official spoke in their defense . 
<PERSON>Edwin Corr</PERSON> , theU.S . 
ambassador from <DATE>1985</DATE> to <DATE>1988</DATE> , singled out <PERSON>Vides Casanova</PERSON> as " the personmost responsible for helping to improve the human rights situation in ElSalvador . " 
But another <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> ambassador , <PERSON>Robert White</PERSON> , testified on behalf of thetorture victims , reading a series of damning <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> cables to thejury . 
" The major immediate threat to the existence of this government is theright-wing violence , " White wrote on <DATE>March 9 , 1980</DATE> . 
" Unfortunately , the commandstructure of the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> and security forces either tolerates or encourages thisactivity . " 
In another cable , on <DATE>May 21 , 1980</DATE> , he described confronting thedefense minister about the torture and killing of unarmed civilians by securityforces . 
" Colonel <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> admitted that the excesses were grave and that he had agood idea who was responsible . . . Colonel <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> made no promise , implicit orexplicit , to put an end to the official violence . 
" During his testimony , <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> defended the military 's human rights record andinsisted that he had tried to protect Salvadorans from torture and repression . 
" I did everything possible that was within my reach , " insisted <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> , who wasawarded the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Legion of Merit</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1983</DATE> by President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> for his service inEl Salvador . 
" At that time , it was not easy . " 
Killing and kidnapping were sorampant on both sides of the conflict that he sent his children to live in <LOCATION>theUnited States</LOCATION> in <DATE>1979</DATE> . 
Two of his drivers barely survived assassinationattempts . 
A close friend was killed because of his relationship with <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> , thegeneral told the jury.Vides Casanova , tall and imposing , with jowls that give him an air of sadness , took the stand after <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> . 
This was the man <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> had accused of directparticipation in his interrogation.Kurt Klaus , the lawyer defending both generals , asked <PERSON>Vides Casanova</PERSON> about thediagram of El Salvador 's <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> headquarters , where some of Romagoza ' storture had allegedly taken place . 
" General Vides , you saw the diagram that Dr.Romagoza testified to ? 
" Yes . 
" Could those cells have existed at the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> headquarters while youwere head of the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> ? " 
" They did not exist . " 
" Is it possible that they existed in another building somewhere in SanSalvador ? " 
" It 's possible . 
Not that I was aware of it . " 
" Could they have been at the national police headquarters ? " 
" I would n't be able to answer that . " 
" Could someone have been tortured on the 10 acres of the <ORGANIZATION>National Guardheadquarters</ORGANIZATION> without you knowing it in <DATE>December of 1979</DATE> ? " 
" I think it could have happened without one knowing about it , but I was neveraware of a single act of torture during my tenure at the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> . . . Inever spoke with anyone who was detained . 
And I have never interrogated anybodyin my entire life ; that has never been my function . " 
" Could that have happened for three and a half weeks beginning <DATE>December 12,1980</DATE> , at the <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> headquarters ? 
Could someone have been detained andtortured without you knowing ? " 
" To me , it is very difficult that someone could have been tortured under thoseconditions . 
Any torture , any scream could have been heard . . . Firing a gunshotinside a building would have been heard . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> was doing everything it could to restore order to ElSalvador , he said . 
The entire country was in turmoil . 
" We all suffered , " he toldthe jury , describing how his relatives were kidnapped , his house wasmachine-gunned , his mother 's house bombed.Romagoza 's lawyer <ORGANIZATION>James Green</ORGANIZATION> cross - examined <PERSON>Vides Casanova</PERSON> . 
" General Vides , is n't it true there was not one single act of insubordination toyour orders during your entire 35-year career as military officer ? " 
" Not that I know of . " 
" And General Vides , because you never ordered an investigation , you neverpunished anyone who was responsible for torture ? " 
" I never discovered anyone carrying out torture . " 
" That is because you never ordered an investigation , correct ? " 
" Correct . 
" After <PERSON>Vides Casanova</PERSON> was finished testifying , the defense rested its case . 
Thenthe judge honored an unusual request from the jurors . 
They wanted to see thevictims ' scars . 
Romagoza bared his left arm where he 'd been shot . 
Hisco-plaintiff <PERSON>Neris Gonzalez</PERSON> uncovered her arms , where a machete had sliced herand cigarettes had been burned into her flesh.Throughout the trial , <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> shuttled back and forth between <LOCATION>West Palm Beachand Washington</LOCATION> , where he threw himself into his work at the clinic . 
Anything totake his mind off the trial.His testimony had forced him to relive his darkest moments , says his therapist , <PERSON>Karen Hanscom</PERSON> , who works at <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> 's Advocates for Survivors of Torture andTrauma and accompanied <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> to Florida.Not many people , she says , " can go through this sort of thing -- to allowyourself to go through just as much pain as when you were tortured , " sheexplains . 
" He is the bravest man I know . 
" Many Salvadorans thought so , too . 
One day , two fellow countrymen stopped by theclinic to offer their sympathy and talk about the trial . 
Over time their numbersswelled . 
Every weekend , as many as 25 Salvadorans would gather at the clinic foran update on the case , hanging on <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> 's every word . 
Who testified ? 
they ' dask . 
How did the generals react ? 
What will happen to them?They knew how hard it had been for <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> to recount his story . 
Many of themhad been victims of torture , of trauma . 
Some were widows . 
Others were kin of thedisappeared . 
They nicknamed themselves the " grupo de los tuertos , " the group ofbroken ones . 
Together , they wept , joked , reminisced , raged.When closing arguments were finished in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> , they held a party , celebratingnot only the end of the trial , but <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> 's willingness to confront the past.The doctor was helping them all heal.The jury was on the verge of a verdict.Romagoza 's lawyers called and urged him to return to <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> . 
His plane wasstill circling the <LOCATION>West Palm Beach</LOCATION> airport the morning of <DATE>July 23 , 2002</DATE> , whenthe jury filed back into the courtroom . 
The jury foreman carried a folded pieceof paper . 
" Has the jury arrived at its verdicts ? " 
asked the judge . 
" It has , your honor , " answered the foreman.The generals were not in the courtroom . 
Their accusers <PERSON>Neris Gonzalez</PERSON> and CarlosMauricio , both of whom had recounted their torture in the same agonizing detailas <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> , waited tensely for the foreman to speak . 
" In the case of <PERSON>Juan Romagoza Arce</PERSON> versus <PERSON>Jose Guillermo Garcia</PERSON> and <PERSON>CarlosEugenio Vides Casanova</PERSON> , we , the jury , return the following verdict upon theclaims of plaintiff Dr. <PERSON>Juan Romagoza Arce</PERSON> . . . " Court spectators gasped . 
Gonzalez and <PERSON>Mauricio</PERSON> exclaimed and wept . 
Afterward , the two Salvadorans and their lawyers raced from the courthouse to meet Romagozaat the airport . 
They caught him exiting the terminal and delivered the news : AnAmerican jury had awarded the three of them <MONEY>$ 54.6 million</MONEY> , including <MONEY>$ 20million</MONEY> to <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> for the loss of his surgeon 's skills.Romagoza could not comprehend it . 
" I thought it was impossible , " he says . 
" I wasshocked -- I was shaking . 
" The case had made legal history , marking the first time such high-rankingmilitary officers living in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> had been held accountable with thehelp of the Torture Victim Protection Act . 
Under the law , signed by the firstPresident <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> in <DATE>1992</DATE> , it did not matter if the generals did not personallyexecute an order , or did not personally oversee atrocities . 
If they heldmilitary command over the perpetrators , knew or should have known of thetorture , could stop it but did nothing , they were responsible.The generals were already planning to appeal the decision , and <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> and theother plaintiffs might never see a dime of award money . 
But what the generals ' attorney called " really just a torts case " had become something much moresignificant : a surrogate war crimes tribunal . 
For many Salvadorans , two decadesof denial and dissembling were over . 
" I wanted to cry , " <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> says , " cry out for all those who died in thestreets , died in the country , died anonymously . 
I think they 'd be happy thatday . 
" Vides Casanova eagerly hauls out his three-inch-thick scrapbooks , whichchronicle his military career . 
They are filled with photographs of three U.S.presidents : <PERSON>Jimmy Carter</PERSON> , <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON> and <PERSON>George H.W. Bush</PERSON> , and carefullypreserved invitations to presidential luncheons and rides aboard <ORGANIZATION>Air Force Twoand Marine</ORGANIZATION> One . 
Other photos show the general standing shoulder to shoulder withU.S . 
military officers ; <PERSON>Colin Powell</PERSON> hovers in the background of ablack-and-white snapshot of a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> military classroom.Vides Casanova flips through the scrapbooks in the living room of his PalmCoast , <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION> , home , where his life now revolves around his children andgrandchildren . 
Look at this , the general urges when he comes acrosscommendations from members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and officers from the <ORGANIZATION>Southern MilitaryCommand</ORGANIZATION> . 
One lauds him as a " shield of democracy . " 
In a letter accompanying oneof two <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Legion of Merit awards , <ORGANIZATION>Defense</ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON>Caspar Weinbergercongratulates Vides Casanova</PERSON> for " broad institutional reform of the SalvadoranArmed forces " and " high professional and ethical standards . 
" Months have passed since the end of the trial , and the general is stillstruggling to make sense of the outcome . 
" We tried to prove that we wereinnocent and that we had done everything proper throughout our lives ; to try toshow that they were trying to accuse us unjustly , " he says . 
" Our image wasdistorted , and it 's a reality we now have to accept . 
" He claims his life has been unaffected by the verdict , which is still beingappealed . 
He says this even though <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> 's lawyers are trying to garnish <MONEY>$ 275,000</MONEY> from his <ORGANIZATION>Merrill Lynch</ORGANIZATION> account and determine whether he has any overseasaccounts and assets . 
Vides Casanova does n't express any hostility toward thosewho sued him , not even <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> . 
" I felt sadness for being seated across from Salvadorans and not being able toshake their hands , " says <PERSON>Vides Casanova</PERSON> . 
But he adds that they were probablyexaggerating their experiences.He speaks with an air of authority , explaining , in Spanish , the holes in theplaintiffs ' case . 
With flowing hand gestures , he argues that since none of themcame forward to report their torture to the authorities at the time , theiraccusations are baseless . 
He boasts about the Salvadoran military 's discipline , professionalism and organization.Then he 's asked about <ORGANIZATION>U.S. State Department</ORGANIZATION> cables describing massive humanrights violations during his command . 
He 's asked about documented massacrescommitted by <ORGANIZATION>National Guardsmen</ORGANIZATION> . 
He 's asked about paramilitary death squads andthe notorious body dump at El Playon , just 20 minutes from his office.Vides <PERSON>Casanova</PERSON> 's lips curl , and his hands grow still . 
He compares himself to adoctor who was n't capable of knowing everything happening in his hospital . 
Heexplains that though parents can train a child to be disciplined and obedient , " the son can do something without the parents realizing it . " 
He insists he onlyheard rumors of torture during his tenure , though he never ordered anyinvestigations to find out whether they were true.He says he served his country ; his conscience is clear.The sounds of blow dryers and ringing telephones drift through <PERSON>Jose GuillermoGarcia</PERSON> 's house in <LOCATION>Plantation</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Fla.</LOCATION> , where , the general says , he gets by on a <MONEY>$ 700-a-month</MONEY> Salvadoran military pension . 
He takes his grandchildren to schooland stays active at his church . 
His family and faith , he explains through atranslator , were a great source of strength during the trials.Garcia came from a poor family and saw the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> as his escape route frompoverty , though the military was n't his first career choice . 
" I really wanted tobe a doctor -- that was my dream . 
I really wanted to heal people . . . That wasmy dearest interest . 
" He says this without irony or guilt . 
Romagoza , he is reminded , was trying toheal people when he was detained . 
But <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> does n't buy that story . 
" All the doctors had left that area in <LOCATION>Chalatenango</LOCATION> because they were worriedthat the terrorists were going to capture them , " <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> says . 
" And so how canyou explain that this man was helping the poor there ? 
He should have been in themain hospital . 
" He deserved to be detained -- he was dressed in combat boots from EagleScouts . 
" Even so , <PERSON>Garcia</PERSON> does n't want anyone to think he countenanced torture ; he says hedid n't . 
" Absolutely nothing justifies the use of torture . 
It 's really not usefulfor anything -- it just worsens the problem . 
" Later , he says " it is possible " torture occurred , " but I was never privy toseeing it . 
" Is it possible you did n't investigate the torture , disappearances and massacresunder your command ? 
" Yes , it 's possible . 
" Is it possible you did n't do anything to discipline the men responsible forthese acts under your leadership ? 
" Yes , it 's possible . " 
" I really tried to be perfect before the law , but nobody is perfect , " <PERSON>Garciasays</PERSON> . 
" The only one who never does anything wrong is the one who never doesanything , period . 
" The longer he talks , the more agitated he becomes . 
" El Salvador was on fire , " heinsists . 
" There were some of us who went out to defend our country and we hadthe approval and support of the majority of the people in El Salvador . . . Inever gave an order that was n't legal , I never sent anyone to get killed . 
" By the end of the interview , he seems worn out , used up . 
Garcia goes to get hiswife , who has apparently been listening from another room . 
Her eyes are red asshe says thank you and farewell to their guests , a reporter and his translator.She does not meet their gaze.The waiting room at La Clinica overflows with patients on a <TIME>winter morning</TIME> , butno one seems to mind the lengthy queue to see a doctor . 
In this community , <ORGANIZATION>LaClinica</ORGANIZATION> is a treasured sanctuary . 
Its patients do n't have to struggle to explaintheir aches and pains in English ; the staff of 50 speak Spanish.Patients do n't have to worry about their lack of medical insurance ; treatment isfree . 
They do n't have to answer questions about their immigration status ; theclinic does n't know and does n't care if they are here illegally.Romagoza presides over the institution he has helped build with tremendous prideand a seemingly endless supply of energy . 
He works here six and sometimes sevendays a week , immersing himself in the daily dramas and demands.Today , the heat is out , and the phones are n't working . 
Every time it rains , theroof leaks . 
The building on <ORGANIZATION>Irving Street NW</ORGANIZATION> has never had an elevator -- patients in wheelchairs have to be carried up a flight of steps -- and vividmurals of peasant life ca n't make up for the ridiculously tight quarters . 
Theplace just is n't big enough to handle 31,000 patient visits a year.Romagoza and the clinic board have long wanted to expand , to move to a larger , more modern space . 
Now , after seven years of fundraising , they are about torealize their dream . 
The clinic is getting ready to relocate to a three-story , <MONEY>$ 3.4 million</MONEY> facility with 10 examination rooms , 11 mental health and HIVcounseling rooms , a chapel and a children 's playroom.As moving day approaches , the excitement grows . 
And so does the sadness . 
For allits shortcomings , the old clinic is filled with memories . 
Romagoza arranges forpsychotherapists to visit with the staff for three or four sessions . 
" We had to prepare ourselves " for the emotional fallout of the move , Romagozasays later . 
" Many people at the last minute did n't want to move . 
They said , ' Iwant to be here . 
I love this building . ' 
That was the big fear for everybody : that we would lose our identity . 
" The last workday in the old building arrives , on <DATE>April 4 , 2003</DATE> . 
The staffmembers close the building with a ceremony of remembrance . 
They read poems andtestimonials . 
Share laughter and shed tears.And then they start dancing -- a conga line snaking through the hallways to thestrains of mariachi music . 
When they are finished , they fall in line behind theband and head up the street to the new building on 15th Street . 
Each staffercarries a stick of incense or a candle and one cherished item from the oldclinic . 
Romagoza brings a Bible given to him by a former patient . 
A largepainting of Archbishop <PERSON>Romero</PERSON> heads the procession.The new La Clinica is pristine , untouched , with freshly painted walls in <LOCATION>Latinreds</LOCATION> , oranges and yellows . 
From <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> 's office , he 'll be able to see patientscongregating in the waiting room , hear their rapid-fire Spanish . 
The staffmembers gather for a moment of silence in their new home . 
Romagoza standsquietly , thinking about all the moves he has made and the goodbyes he has said . 
" I remember when I came here , how I was a refugee , " he says later . 
" I came herewith nothing -- only my clothes . 
I moved from El Salvador , <LOCATION>Guatemala</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> , [ <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> ] and then [ to ] <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . 
Moving , moving , moving . 
But each time hasbeen a little different , a little improved . 
" The torture did n't end his journey ; it was , in retrospect , its starting point.After the trial , <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> found himself longing to return to El Salvador . 
He ' dbeen back before . 
In <DATE>1991</DATE> , after an armistice between the government and theguerrillas , he returned to <LOCATION>Chalatenango</LOCATION> and sought out the place where his wifeis buried . 
Her grave lies in a forest near the Honduran border , marked by asimple cross . 
It is , <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> says , a peaceful place . 
Someday , after hisdaughter finishes school , he 'll take her there.He also ventured to <LOCATION>Santa Anita</LOCATION> , the town where he was abducted during the feastof the Virgin of <LOCATION>Guadalupe</LOCATION> . 
It looked exactly the same as he remembered it . 
" Twowomen actually recognized me , " he says . 
" They were amazed and said , ' Were youthat young doctor who helped us during the war ? 
We thought you were dead ! ' 
" From then on , he returned to El Salvador twice a year , seeing firsthand how thecountry was recovering from years of bloodshed . 
Under their agreement with thegovernment , the guerrillas were integrated into El Sal - vador 's civilian policeforces . 
The <ORGANIZATION>National Guard</ORGANIZATION> and the military were downsized , becoming lessvisible and menacing . 
The <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Truth Commission</ORGANIZATION> report detailed many of thewar 's worst atrocities , but a sweeping amnesty law guaranteed that no one in ElSalvador would be tried for them . 
No one would be punished for the torturecells , the massacres , the body dumps . 
It was as if a conflict that had claimed75 ,000 lives and wounded thousands of others had never happened . 
" We do n't talk about the war , " <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> says . 
" In some way , that 's how weresolved things in <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> . 
" But the trial in <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> had pierced the silence , making headlines in SanSalvador just as it had in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . 
Now that the testimony was over , the fearwas back . 
Romagoza wanted to visit <LOCATION>Usulutan</LOCATION> , but delayed the trip for months . 
Ifthere had been death threats before the testimony started , what would he facenow ? 
Many people in <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> thought <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> was rich as a result of theverdict , though he has yet to receive any money.That perception could make him a target for kidnappers in one of <LOCATION>Latin America</LOCATION> ' smost crime-plagued countries . 
His family did n't think he 'd be safe.But he could n't stay away . 
After the opening of the new clinic , he boarded aplane to <LOCATION>San Salvador</LOCATION> to spend Easter with his family . 
Relatives met him outsidethe airport . 
They were armed , just in case.Romagoza kept a low profile throughout the visit . 
He missed some of the HolyWeek events in <LOCATION>Usulatan</LOCATION> because of the throngs they attracted . 
Friendsaccompanied him on walks , and they made him turn his lights off at dark.Few people asked him about the trial , especially in public . 
" They say it isdangerous to remember , " <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> says . 
Sometimes it came up over dinner withclose friends . 
None of them could get over his willingness to confront the past.But by doing so , he says , he has loosened its hold on him.When he was in his cell , he remembers , the first thing he would hear in themorning was the Salvadoran national anthem . 
The guards would listen to it at 6a . 
m. as they finished their breakfasts and were preparing to resume theirbeatings.For years , <PERSON>Romagoza</PERSON> could not bear to hear that music . 
Then , when he was back inEl Salvador this past <DATE>spring</DATE> , he heard the anthem being played on the radioearly one morning as he made his way to the market . 
He stopped to listen . 
Themusic no longer reminded him of black-booted men coming to hurt him . 
Instead itmade him think of the country he 'd always loved : its mountains , its dusty roads , its churches , its people.De la paz en la dicha suprema / siempre noble so El Salvador.Of peace enjoyed in perfect happiness / <LOCATION>El Salvador</LOCATION> has always nobly dreamed.Joshua <PERSON>E.S.
