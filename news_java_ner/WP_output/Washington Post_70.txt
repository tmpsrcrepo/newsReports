Judge <PERSON>Verbena Askew</PERSON> apparently lied , and that 's not a good thing for any judgeto do . 
The judge also was on the bad end of a <MONEY>$ 64,000</MONEY> settlement with anadministrator in her <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> courthouse who accused Askew of propositioning her -- not the most decorous position for a public official , either.Today , with heavy hearts , genuine tears and barely concealed glee , Virginialegislators threw Askew off the bench , denying her reappointment as a CircuitCourt judge in <LOCATION>Newport News</LOCATION> . 
Verdict : Askew lied about the advances and then didher darnedest to cover it up . 
Sound familiar?This was the culminating act in the <ORGANIZATION>General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> 's Let 's Hear Juicy BitsAbout Lesbians Week , a seedy little enterprise in which the ever-bolderRepublican majority had itself a whale of a time grilling judges about theirsexual pleasures . 
Oh , they larded the proceedings with protestations of theirlack of interest in anyone 's private affairs , but man , they just could n't waitto get their hands on documents detailing the judge 's alleged sexual stumbles.They subjected Askew to a seven-hour hearing last week that featured hardly aword about her performance as a judge , but endless questions about her , heh heh , proclivities.After today 's concluding episode , I asked <PERSON>Kenneth W. Stolle</PERSON> ( R-Virginia Beach ) , chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Courts of Justice Committee</ORGANIZATION> , whether there would havebeen any interest in debating <ORGANIZATION>Askew</ORGANIZATION> 's reappointment had it not been for theaccusations from the courthouse employee . 
" No , " <PERSON>Stolle</PERSON> said . 
" This came to us because there was a sexual harassmentcomplaint and as part of an effort to cover that up , the judge did a number ofthings she should n't have done . 
" Does this sound like a junior version of the Bill and Monica Show ? 
It 's notabout sex , it 's about lying about sex , legislators kept saying , even as theypassed hour upon hour in packed hearing rooms , referring one another to the bestparts in the transcripts.Of course , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> legislators need not travel so far back in time forinspiration . 
They have the even fresher case of <PERSON>S. Vance Wilkins Jr.</PERSON> , the <PERSON>Housespeaker</PERSON> who was forced into retirement last year after The <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Postreported that he paid <MONEY>$ 100,000</MONEY> to settle a sexual harassment claim made by awoman who worked at his old construction company.So lawmakers have harassment on the brain these days . 
But to black legislators , the <ORGANIZATION>Askew</ORGANIZATION> probe was nothing short of a " lynching , " an " execution " by whites who , as Sen. <PERSON>Henry L. Marsh III</PERSON> ( D-Richmond ) put it , " held her to a standard that noother judge is held to , regarding questions of a purely personal nature . 
" Well , not quite . 
Askew may have been ashamed to admit whatever she did with orto her accuser in the harassment case , but she indeed answered no on a barassociation questionnaire that asked whether she was the subject of any legal oradministrative proceeding . 
Judges , of all people , should tell it straight . 
Heck , they are a controlling legal authority.Marsh accused his colleagues of " an effort to get this judge . " 
There he isright . 
Are legislators systematically vetting all of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's judges ? 
Or arethey leaping to investigate judges who veer from the straight and narrow sexualpath ? 
The three judicial targets of interest this session were <ORGANIZATION>Askew ; Court</ORGANIZATION> ofAppeals Judge <PERSON>Rosemarie Annunziata</PERSON> , who was grilled about her opinion in a caseinvolving a lesbian relationship ; and <ORGANIZATION>state Supreme Court Justice BarbaraKeenan</ORGANIZATION> , who was asked about her dissent arguing against removing a child from amother 's custody solely because the mother is a lesbian . 
( Legislators eventuallyapproved <PERSON>Annunziata</PERSON> 's reappointment and reelected <PERSON>Keenan</PERSON> . ) 
<LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> is still a place where lawmakers get good mileage out of jokes abouthomosexuality . 
And -- no joke -- <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> is one of a dwindling number of stateswhere sodomy is still illegal . 
That fact last week led <LOCATION>Del</LOCATION> . 
<ORGANIZATION>Robert F. McDonnell</ORGANIZATION> ( <LOCATION>R-Virginia Beach</LOCATION> ) , chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> courts committee , to opine that anyonewho engages in oral or anal sex might not be qualified to be a judge inVirginia.An enterprising reporter from <ORGANIZATION>the Daily Press</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Newport News</LOCATION> asked McDonnellwhether he had ever violated the state 's " crimes against nature " law . 
" Not thatI can recall , " he replied.That 's not a clear " No , " is it ? 
Hearings , anyone?Join me at noon today for " Potomac Confidential " at www.washingtonpost.com/liveonline .
