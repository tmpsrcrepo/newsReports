Sen. <PERSON>Ki rsten Gilli</PERSON> bra nd is sitt i ng at a co r n e r table in the Se natedinin g room , eati ng a salad and ducking q uestions about he r politicalambitions , when she spots fellow Democrat <PERSON>Elizabeth Warren</PERSON> walking in . 
Minutes later , <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> has ushered her interviewer to meet the <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> senator . 
Thetwo women , who are frequently mentioned as possible backups to <PERSON>Hillary Clintonfor</PERSON> the <DATE>2016</DATE> Democratic presidential nomination , cheerfully trade pleasantries.Â ¶ " She 's great , " <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> says . 
Â ¶ " She 's really amazing , " <PERSON>Warren</PERSON> says . 
Â ¶ Though brief , the exchange captures <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> 's political skill , as she seizeson an opportunity to make a reporter feel like an insider and , at the same time , showcases cordial relations with a colleague others are casting as a potentialrival . 
Â ¶ Telegenic and brainy , the 47-year-old junior senator from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> andmother of two has become a visible face in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> , a regular at women ' sforums and policy talk shows , and something of a political pinup ( The Hill namedher one of its 50 most beautiful in <DATE>2010</DATE> ) . 
An obscure second-term <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> memberwhen appointed to fill <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> 's seat in <DATE>2009</DATE> , she has won election andreelection , both by landslides . 
" If <PERSON>Hillary Clinton</PERSON> does n't run in <DATE>2016</DATE> , I would n't be surprised to see KirstenGillibrand jump in , " says <PERSON>Larry Sabato</PERSON> , director of the <ORGANIZATION>Center for Politics atthe University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Gillibrand seems to have the ambition to do it . 
" In her sixth year in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> , working out of <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> 's former quarters in <ORGANIZATION>theRussell Senate Office Building</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> has carved out territory includingmilitary and middle-class issues , and fashioned an image as a tenacious fighterfor women . 
Now , she has taken another step along the modern-day passage to thepresidency : writing a political memoir . 
With an introduction by <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> , " Offthe Sidelines : Raise Your Voice , Change the World " is due out <DATE>Sept. 9</DATE> . 
LikeGillibrand 's political action committee of the same name , it exhorts women totake the lead in politics , in business and at home . 
" I wrote the book toencourage women to use their voices , '' she says.Gillibrand says she 's " worried that the women 's movement is dead . " 
Acknowledgingthat some feminist leaders might find that characterization inflammatory , shesays , " I think those of us who are in the trenches recognize we 're in a toughplace . " 
While citing achievements such as keeping abortion-rights efforts aliveand helping women advance in the workforce , she contends that " there 's nofunctional movement where we 're working together and making sure all women areheard on all these issues . 
" With " Off the Sidelines , " she says , " I 'm creating a call to â [ #x 20ac ] ¦ createthe women 's movement we need for this generation . 
" The title is " perfect for her , since she is not on the sidelines one minute ofher life , " says Rep. <PERSON>Debbie Wasserman Schultz</PERSON> ( D-Fla . ) 
, <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> 's closefriend and softball team co-captain . 
So , to continue the analogy , the question becomes this : If <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> is off thesidelines , where is she going ? 
Is she headed for the quarterback position ? 
Isshe running for president ? 
" I would say that I 'm supporting Hillary in <DATE>2016</DATE> , " the senator says , " and I amgoing to fight very hard to see that she wins . 
" And if <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> does n't run?Gillibrand shrugs.Political books serve different purposes : campaign tools , ego boosters , policytracts , coming-of-age reminiscences . 
<PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> 's has a bit of each . 
It tellsthe story of <PERSON>Kirsten Elizabeth Rutnik</PERSON> , a middle-class <PERSON>Roman Catholic Albanyschoolgirl</PERSON> who was driven to excel and influenced by a line of strong-willed , iconoclastic women who cared little about public opinion.Her maternal great-grandmother , <PERSON>Mimi</PERSON> , an Irish immigrant , worked at anammunition arsenal during World War II , kicked her husband out of the house fordrinking too much and chose to raise her children alone . 
Mimi 's daughter , <PERSON>Kirsten</PERSON> 's grandmother , <PERSON>Dorothea</PERSON> " Polly " <PERSON>McLean Noonan</PERSON> became a prominent figurein <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION> and an intimate of longtime mayor <PERSON>Erastus Corning</PERSON> . 
Salty-tongued andbrazen , she was a leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Albany Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> machine , doling outpatronage and favors , organizing government secretaries known as " Polly ' sGirls , " and heading the <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION> Democratic Women 's Club.Kirsten ( everyone called her Tina ) learned campaign basics from her grandmother , stuffing envelopes , sticking bumper stickers on cars , handing out fliers andknocking on doors . 
" I really wanted to follow my grandmother into politics , " shesays , " and I liked how assured she was , and I liked that she was passionateabout what she did . 
" <PERSON>Kirsten</PERSON> 's mother , also named <PERSON>Polly</PERSON> , founded a law firm in <LOCATION>Albany</LOCATION> with herhusband , <PERSON>Douglas P. Rutnik</PERSON> . 
<PERSON>Polly Rutnik</PERSON> ran the home as well as practicing law.She cooked , did most of the housework , looked after her three children , <PERSON>Douglas</PERSON> , <PERSON>Kirsten</PERSON> and <PERSON>Erin</PERSON> , and found time to earn a black belt in karate and hunt turkeysfor Thanksgiving . 
" She prioritized both work and family ; I never imagined Iwould do otherwise , " <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> writes in the book . 
( <PERSON>Kirsten</PERSON> 's parents divorcedwhen she was 22 . ) 
Kirsten learned to cope with stress and competition on the tennis court , andlearned to argue at home , with her father . 
" I fought about everything , " shesays . 
" Can I go to a party ? 
Can I go to a concert ? " 
He called her Foghorn andLoudmouth.Despite standing up to her father , " I was a massive kiss - [ a -- ] and lived forpositive reinforcement , " she writes in her book . 
" As a child , I wrote in perfectcursive penmanship , thanks to the nuns . 
I did all my homework as soon as I gothome , and I kept my room clean . " 
She was a goody-two-shoes , except for hertemper and her elbows-out determination to excel . 
" Whatever I did - debating , playing the piano or tennis , selling Girl Scout cookies - I had to earn a goldstar . 
" She went to Catholic schools from kindergarten to middle school and attendedEmma <PERSON>Willard</PERSON> , an elite all-girls high school . 
At <ORGANIZATION>Dartmouth</ORGANIZATION> , she ignored campuspolitics , joined a sorority , majored in Asian studies ( spending a semester inBeijing , where her roommate was <PERSON>Connie Britton</PERSON> of TV 's " <LOCATION>Nashville</LOCATION> , " who remainsa friend ) and graduated magna cum laude . 
Only after earning a degree at the UCLASchool of Law and landing a job at the international law firm <ORGANIZATION>Davis Polk & Wardwell</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> did <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> get involved in politics . 
" The voice that inspired me to take my life in a new direction came in a pinksuit , " she writes . 
On <DATE>Sept. 5 , 1995</DATE> , first lady <PERSON>Hillary Clinton</PERSON> spoke inBeijing at the <ORGANIZATION>Fourth World Conference on Women</ORGANIZATION> , forging the phrase that becamea mantra for women worldwide : Human rights are women 's rights and women 's rightsare human rights . 
Hearing about the speech made <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> wish she had beenthere and had been part of the conversation . 
And it brought back her childhooddream of being in politics , like her grandmother.Shortly afterward , <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> heard <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> speak at the Women 's LeadershipForum in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> , which she joined . 
" That 's what got me into the nuts and boltsof <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> politics , " <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> says . 
In <DATE>1996</DATE> , she was an unpaidfundraiser in President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> 's reelection campaign and , four yearslater , volunteered to raise money for Vice President <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> . 
After Gore ' sdefeat , she went to work at <ORGANIZATION>Boies , Schiller & Flexner</ORGANIZATION> - whose star attorney , <PERSON>David Boies</PERSON> , had represented <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> in <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> v. Gore - and was made partner , earning about <MONEY>$ 450,000</MONEY> a year.She kept her hand in politics , fundraising for <PERSON>Hillary Clinton</PERSON> 's senatorialcampaign and training to run for office herself , moving to her firm 's Albanyoffice so she could vie for a congressional seat close to her <ORGANIZATION>Upstate</ORGANIZATION> roots . 
In2006 , she ran for the conservative 20th Congressional District against a popularRepublican.She proved to be a tireless campaigner and prolific fundraiser , amassing <MONEY>$ 4.6 million</MONEY> , a stunning sum for a congressional campaign . 
Her opponent , Rep. <PERSON>John E.Sweeney</PERSON> , who portrayed her as an out-of-touch , rich Manhattanite , was leading inthe polls . 
But shortly before <DATE>Election Day</DATE> , a police report was leaked tonewspapers saying that <PERSON>Sweeney</PERSON> 's wife had called 911 to say he was beating her.His camp said <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> leaked the report ; she declined to say . 
She won by 6points . 
Despite that upset , <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> was unknown in much of <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> when Gov. <PERSON>DavidA</PERSON> . 
Paterson appointed her to fill <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> 's <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> term in a controversial moveseen as a nod to her gender and <ORGANIZATION>Upstate</ORGANIZATION> support . 
It did n't help that she hadbeen the second choice , after <PERSON>Caroline Kennedy</PERSON> , yet ahead of more experiencedrepresentatives . 
<PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> was sworn in on <DATE>Jan. 27 , 2009</DATE> , at 42 then theyoungest member of the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Senate.From the start she ran into a wall . 
Some colleagues and newspaper columnistscalled her <PERSON>Tracy Flick</PERSON> , referring to the blond , ambitious <PERSON>Reese Witherspooncharacter</PERSON> in the film " Election . " 
In <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> 's liberal circles , her 15years as a highly paid corporate lawyer and two years representing aconservative district did n't sit well . 
She was seen as a political lightweightand labeled pro-gun , pro-Wall Street , anti-immigration and pro-tobacco . 
( Duringthe tobacco wars of the <DATE>1990s</DATE> , she had helped represent <ORGANIZATION>Altria</ORGANIZATION> , parent companyof <PERSON>Philip Morris</PERSON> . ) 
Enlisting supporters like the <PERSON>Clintons</PERSON> , she countered with acampaign to win over blacks , Hispanics and other liberals . 
She won election to aSenate term in <DATE>2010</DATE> , 63 to <PERCENT>35 percent</PERCENT> , then reelection two years ago , 72 to 26percent . 
Along with broadening her electoral base , <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> has come to be associatedwith several high-profile issues . 
She was a leader in the successful struggle torepeal " do n't ask , do n't tell . " 
She was on the front lines of the campaign togain approval of marriage equality in the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> legislature , and was amongthe first Democrats to call for bringing combat troops home from <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> . 
Toaddress the plight of low - and middle-income families , she has fashioned anambitious agenda that includes raising the minimum wage , affordable day care anduniversal pre-K education . 
She established Off the Sidelines as a PAC in 2011and raised <MONEY>$ 1 million</MONEY> for female candidates in the <DATE>2012</DATE> cycle . 
Her goal is todouble that for the midterms this year , and she says she is close to doing it.Another issue she has focused on : sexual abuses in the armed forces . 
She waged ayearlong battle for her bill to strip commanders of their authority to prosecutethose cases and give that responsibility to military lawyers outside the chainof command . 
Military leaders opposed the measure , and in <DATE>March</DATE> , her proposalcame up five votes short of the 60 needed to advance to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> floor . 
Sen.Claire <PERSON>McCaskill</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Missouri</LOCATION> , a Democrat , led the fight to block it , offeringbipartisan reforms that kept prosecution within the chain of command . 
" I was devastated , " <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> says . 
" She is formidable , " says <PERSON>McCaskill</PERSON> , who is now working with <ORGANIZATION>Gillibrand</ORGANIZATION> onlegislation to curb sexual assaults on university campuses . 
" She does n't stop.She lobbies every senator over and over . 
I tell people , ' If you are going tooppose <PERSON>Kirsten Gillibrand</PERSON> , you need to pack your lunch , because you wo n't havetime to go out . ' 
" Hill watchers often cite <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> 's political appeal . 
" She has impressivelyemerged from the paralyzed muck of the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Senate</ORGANIZATION> because she offers aprogressive vision , " says <PERSON>Steve Clemons</PERSON> , a senior fellow at the New AmericaFoundation and an editor at large at the <LOCATION>Atlantic</LOCATION> . 
<PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> " brings to hergame a love of detail and dealmaking reminiscent of <ORGANIZATION>LBJ</ORGANIZATION> . 
" And while <PERSON>Sabrina Schaeffer</PERSON> , executive director of the conservative IndependentWomen 's Forum , opposes <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> 's legislative agenda , she also says <PERSON>Gillibrandhas</PERSON> a " girl-next-door personality women and men can identify with " and " haschecked off all the right boxes on women 's issues . 
" But <PERSON>Michael Barone</PERSON> , a political analyst and resident fellow at the <ORGANIZATION>AmericanEnterprise Institute</ORGANIZATION> and contributor to <ORGANIZATION>Fox News</ORGANIZATION> , dismisses <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> , saying : " I do n't think many conservatives have given much thought to her . 
They see heras a conventional liberal in a safe seat with no national career in the shortterm . 
" <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> 's memoir , which she will promote on a coast-to-coast tour this month , will generate talk of a presidential run no matter how much she fends off thequestion . 
" It 's always a bit amusing when a relatively junior senator decides to offer upan autobiography , " says <DATE>U-Va</DATE> . 
's <PERSON>Sabato</PERSON> . 
" That means one thing : She 's interestedin higher office . 
" In style , however , <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> 's book differs significantly from previouspolitical memoirs . 
Hers is a quick read , chatty , candid , with self-help and evendiet advice . 
" It 's not a policy book , " she says.Beltway commentators may find it frothy , but she says she wants to reach a widerset of readers , especially women , people who may not want an insider 's accountof life in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . 
" Empowerment of all women is important , " she says , notjust those who are seeking to crack the ceiling , or lean in or lean out.She bristles at the debate about whether women can have it all . 
" It 's an absurdargument . " 
The very phrase " have it all , " she says , implies that women aregreedy and demeans stay-at-home mothers . 
For many mothers , she says , working isa financial necessity , not a choice , and she says she is particularly concernedabout low-and-middle-income women , especially single moms . 
" I do n't have theirtough choices , but I share the same experience that they have , " she says . 
" Weall want to be good moms . 
We all want to be good at our jobs . 
We all want toprovide for our children . 
" Still , if the question is n't about having it all , many who spend time aroundKirsten <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> seem to wonder how she does it all . 
She and her husband , <PERSON>Jonathan Gillibrand</PERSON> , a British-born financial manager , moved to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> in2007 , but for the past two years , he has spent workweeks in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> whiletheir two boys stay with her . 
" She is taking care of two small children and working her head off in theSenate , " says Sen. <PERSON>Susan Collins</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Maine</LOCATION> , among the Republicans who backedGillibrand on the military bill . 
" It 's not like she has live-in help the way alot of people in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> do , and I just do n't know how she does it . 
" <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> 's mornings begin between 6 and 6:30 , when <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> , her 6-year-old , alive wire who is starting first grade , wakes her . 
" Almost always , I feelexhausted when I get up , " she says . 
She fixes breakfast for the boys , packstheir lunches , does laundry or dishes , checks their homework and drives them toschool . 
If she has time she stops at the gym for a workout and arrives in heroffice by 9 . 
She 's usually on Capitol Hill until <TIME>late afternoon</TIME> when she getsaway to pick up the boys at school.A trim 5-foot-2 , she gains weight easily - <DATE>50</DATE> pounds when she was pregnant withHenry . 
When she got to the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> , she went on a crash regimen , dropped her sizeto a 4 or 6 from 16 , and was featured in <LOCATION>Vogue</LOCATION> . 
" If I eat more than 1,400 calories a day , I gain weight , " she says . 
She cooks almost every weeknight , typically chicken , fish or lean beef , with salad and vegetables . 
A masterjuggler , she can cook , sweep , pick up schoolbooks and children 's shoes lyingabout , and carry on a conversation at the same time.After dinner , she might take Theo , who is 10 and in fifth grade , to sportspractice or whatever is on his schedule . 
Like their mother , the boys lead busylives : baseball , soccer , squash , T-ball , piano , singing and taekwondo . 
She triesto get to bed about 10 . 
" If I do n't get enough sleep , I get irritable andemotional . 
" The Gillibrands live in a three-story brick rowhouse on Capitol Hill . 
They havea sparsely furnished living room with an upright piano . 
The kitchen , acomfortable open space with a dining table , has framed photographs of thesenator with the boys , <ORGANIZATION>Henry</ORGANIZATION> 's crayon drawings , and notes on the refrigeratordoor . 
Parked out back is an old <ORGANIZATION>Porsche</ORGANIZATION> belonging to <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> 's husband , currently working with Formula One racing . 
" We use my van to get around , " shesays.The couple met in <DATE>1999</DATE> when <PERSON>Jonathan</PERSON> , two years her junior , was getting an MBAat <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> and she was working at <ORGANIZATION>Davis Polk</ORGANIZATION> . 
They were married in <DATE>2001</DATE> . 
" We ' reopposites in many ways , " she says . 
" That 's probably why it works . " 
Jonathan , whois private , methodical and thoughtful , has been encouraging her politicalcareer , offering cautious advice and absorbing criticism . 
But her first year inthe <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> was difficult , as she recounts in her book . 
They lived with Theo in aVirginia suburb . 
Jonathan hated <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and had no job . 
They argued . 
At onepoint he told her , " Your job is the reason we do n't have more kids ! " 
Sherealized he had a point . 
Soon she was pregnant with Henry.When the family is together on weekends " we do things the boys like to do , '' usually sports , she says . 
" <PERSON>Jonathan</PERSON> is really good about chores . 
I do not naghim . 
I do not ask him to do things . 
I typically do the cooking because itrelaxes me . 
But <PERSON>Jonathan</PERSON> helps clean up . 
He 's is more supportive than theaverage husband . 
" For someone who is all about women forging ahead , it may seem ironic that shetakes on the majority of parenting duties . 
But , she says : " I think most workingmoms do it all . 
They do a lot of caregiving . 
They do a lot of housework . 
Andthey work full time . 
" The next morning in her busy office , <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> is with her , slouching on the sofa , playing with pieces on a chessboard and trying hard to obey his mother and keepquiet.Settling into a favorite wingback chair , <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> says she wants to recruit 6million women to active service in politics , businesses and communities . 
Sixmillion is the number of women who entered the workforce to replace the men whohad gone to battle during World War II.Looking up at a poster of Rosie the <LOCATION>Riveter</LOCATION> , the advertising character whorepresented those women , <PERSON>Gillibrand</PERSON> echoes , " We can do it ! 
" Former <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON>Luisita Lopez Torregrosa</PERSON> is a journalist and authorbasedin <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> .
