SAMUEL <ORGANIZATION>PEPYSThe Unequalled SelfBy Claire TomalinKnopf</ORGANIZATION> . 
470 pp . 
$ 30Samuel <PERSON>Pepys</PERSON> ( 1633-1703 ) kept his celebrated diary for only nine years , from1660-1669 , starting when he was 26 . 
Written in shorthand -- with the racierepisodes related in a potpourri of languages ( " mi mano was sobra her pectus , andso did hazer with grand delight " ) -- the book was n't transcribed into readableEnglish until the <DATE>19th century</DATE> and was n't commonly available in itsunbowdlerized entirety until <DATE>1970</DATE> . 
Despite a history of puritanical editing , thediary quickly established a reputation as one of those naughty literaryclassics , like <PERSON>Chaucer</PERSON> 's " <PERSON>Miller</PERSON> 's Tale , " <PERSON>Defoe</PERSON> 's <PERSON>Moll Flanders</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wycherly</PERSON> 's " The Country Wife . 
" <PERSON>Pepys</PERSON> , though married to the strong-willed , tempestuous , half-French <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> , herself a beauty , does in fact regularly interfere with pretty serving girls , ladies ' maids , tavern wenches , mainly by squeezing their breasts and pinchingtheir bottoms . 
But there 's nothing particularly erotic or even bawdy about hisaccounts of 17th-century sexual harassment . 
He records a tumble with <PERSON>Betty Lanewith</PERSON> the same strict accuracy as he does his pleasure in a production of " Hamlet " or the purchase of a keg of oysters . 
In every sense , <PERSON>Pepys</PERSON> is very mucha man of accounts , in his work as a secretary to the <ORGANIZATION>Naval Board</ORGANIZATION> , in his closeattention to his household funds and in his depiction of his own life.Little wonder , then , that his days , no matter how full and varied , always seemto balance : A variant on " Up betimes and to the office " opens most of theentries , just as some form of the famous " And so to bed " closes them . 
Everythingin between is noted in precise factual sentences : Even when printed asregularized English , the prose sounds like shorthand . 
Pepys may sometimesconfess that he 's sad or out of sorts , but he does n't go maundering on and onabout it , or larding his reflections with Latin quotations , as <ORGANIZATION>Montaigne</ORGANIZATION> or SirThomas <PERSON>Browne</PERSON> might . 
Instead he 's a pointillist , quickly daubing in the elementsof his daily life as a young careerist on the make in Restoration England.Though watchful of the world around him and especially attentive to the miens ofthe men who might advance his career , <PERSON>Pepys</PERSON> also possesses an irrepressiblegusto for life itself , and he works his hedonism hard : music-making , theater-going , flirting , drinking , paying social calls , reading , conversing anddisputing with his wife . 
They 're all scribbled down in his quicksilver jottings , a nonstop barrage of data , like individual frames of film that the reader joinstogether to achieve a cinematic sense of life zipping along at fast-forward . 
No page of <PERSON>Pepys</PERSON> ever seems mediated or deliberative -- he 's essentially a " facts , just the facts " kind of writer . 
But even as the rapid notation and hisrun-on style ( " And . . . and . . . " ) give his diary vivacity , they alsosometimes frustrate : One hungers for expansiveness , quotation , detail , all thosematters at which discursive prose normally excels . 
He keeps you wanting just abit more than he delivers -- one of the secrets , perhaps , of his perennialfascination . 
Just what , for example , were those erotic tricks by which BarbaraVilliers , a k a Mrs. <PERSON>Palmer</PERSON> , a k a <LOCATION>Lady Castlemaine</LOCATION> , ensnared the king?Not that <PERSON>Pepys</PERSON> , that ardent playgoer , did n't possess a flair for the dramatic oran eye for a well-put-together scene . 
The at first halting , uncertain progressof the Great Fire is underscored by his own tentativeness and confusion , succeeded by a burst of frenetic activity . 
He closely observes the understateddrama of the royal barges landing at <ORGANIZATION>Whitehall</ORGANIZATION> , the King stepping ashore withthe Queen and <LOCATION>Lady Castlemaine</LOCATION> watching and everybody pretending to ignore oneanother . 
Best of all may be the series of diary entries that recounts theaftermath of <PERSON>Pepys</PERSON> 's involvement with <PERSON>Deb</PERSON> , his wife 's maid . 
As <PERSON>Claire Tomalinsays</PERSON> in her fine and engrossing biography , " I know of no other account ofmarital rage and jealousy to match this one . " 
It opens with a mournful flourishin the middle of <PERSON>Pepys</PERSON> 's write-up for <DATE>Oct. 25 , 1668</DATE> : " And at night <PERSON>W. Batelier</PERSON> comes and sups with us ; and after supper , to have myhead combed by <PERSON>Deb</PERSON> , which occasioned the greatest sorrow to me that ever I knewin this world ; for my wife , coming up suddenly , did find me imbracing the girlcon my hand sub su coats . . . . I wast at a wonderful loss upon it , and the girlalso ; and I endeavoured to put it off ; but my wife was struck mute and grewangry , and as her voice came to her , grew quite out of order ; and I do saylittle , but to bed ; and my wife said little also , but could not sleep all night ; but about 2 in the morning waked me and cried . 
" During the next weeks , <PERSON>Pepys</PERSON> 's life becomes so hellish that he grows afraid togo home at night . 
Oddly , though , in spite of all the accusations and denials andgeneral despair , the errant husband and his wronged wife have sex " more timessince this falling-out then in I believe twelve months before -- and with morepleasure to her then I think in all the time of our marriage before . " 
Such arethe strange byways of passion.Because <PERSON>Pepys</PERSON> 's diary spotlights his young manhood so brilliantly , it is easy toforget about his impoverished youth or the last thirty-odd years of his publiclife . 
Though <PERSON>Tomalin</PERSON> admires the diarist as an almost inadvertent genius ( " themost ordinary and the most extraordinary writer you will ever meet " ) , she frameshis self-portrait within the context of the times and his entire public career.To explain how a tailor 's son rose to power as , roughly , a cabinet minister incharge of naval affairs , she must describe the Civil War , <PERSON>Cromwell</PERSON> , themachinations to restore <PERSON>Charles II</PERSON> and the impact of the plague . 
She details thesystem of patronage , bribes and quid pro quo that kept the Restoration 's merryworld spinning along . 
She shows how the older <PERSON>Pepys</PERSON> survived the Popish Plot -- in which he was accused of being a Catholic rebel -- and she discusses hisinteractions with the great men of the period : kings , aristocrats such as hispatron the <ORGANIZATION>Earl of Sandwich</ORGANIZATION> , industrial magnates and eminent scholars ( RobertHooke , <PERSON>Christopher Wren</PERSON> , <PERSON>Hans Sloane</PERSON> ) . 
Not least , <PERSON>Tomalin</PERSON> reminds us of Pepys ' sphysical stoicism : He endured painful and delicate surgery for kidney stones at25 , with a fair possibility of death , and worried for years that he was goingblind . 
Because reading and writing eventually caused him such ocular distress , he abandoned his diary.Not only an able biographer in the lively English style of <PERSON>Richard Holmes</PERSON> , <PERSON>Michael Holroyd</PERSON> and <PERSON>Victoria Glendinning</PERSON> , <PERSON>Claire Tomalin</PERSON> also possesses aparticularly graceful and pleasing diction , a proper sense of measure ( by nomeans is her subject a wholly admirable , let alone a heroic , figure ) and apiquant willingness to express her own views : We are left in no doubt as to howreprehensible she finds <PERSON>Pepys</PERSON> 's sophomoric groping and pursuit of young girls , nor how tough-minded his wife and his later " companion " <PERSON>Mary Skinner</PERSON> must havebeen to put up with him.In itself highly agreeable reading , <PERSON>Samuel Pepys</PERSON> : The Unequalled Self shouldalso lead one to either start on or return to this most irresistible , this mostaddictive , of English diaries . 
Expect a good time : " It is strange what weather we have had all <DATE>this winter</DATE> ; no cold at all , but theways are dusty and the flyes fly up and down , and the rosebushes are full ofleaves ; such a time of the year as never was known in this world before here.This day , many more of the fifth monarchy men were hanged .
