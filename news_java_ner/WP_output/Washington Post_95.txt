Dear Carolyn : I am a high school senior fast approaching graduation and my 18th birthday . 
Ihave been seeing a girl , " <DATE>June</DATE> , " since the beginning of the school year . 
She isbeautiful , smart , sweet and the best girlfriend I 've ever had . 
Now comes the " but " : <DATE>June</DATE> is a freshman and she is 14 . 
Most people would think I am with herjust to take advantage of her , but this is not the case since we have n't had sexand I 'm still a virgin by choice . 
We 've talked about the situation for when <DATE>Iturn 18</DATE> but there does n't seem to be a conclusion . 
I 'm confused because I do n'tknow if it will work between us , since I 'll be in college . 
And the law statesthat sex between an 18-year-old and someone four years younger is statutoryrape , and we have been getting more and more intimate as time goes on.I feel if I discontinue seeing her that I will be leaving her on a thread sincewe 've grown so close emotionally , but I also feel that if I do n't I will beopening the doors to more trouble . 
I wo n't be seeing her much next <DATE>fall</DATE> due tocollege in another county . 
Am I being a bad boyfriend by moving on with my life ? 
-- MarylandThe " conclusion " for when you turn 18 is to keep your statutory pants on . 
Thelaw is the least of the reasons . 
She 's 14 , she 's not ready for sex . 
Humor me , make your mouth form the words : N-N-NOT RED-DEE . 
Sex vaults a person onto awhole other level of knowledge and responsibility , and unless she has sufficientemotional and life experience to prepare her for it , the weight of it can becrushing . 
She 's 14 , she 's only a fifth , even a sixth of the way through herlife . 
These are her lighter years , and she 's entitled to them , and when they ' regone they never come back , so get your mitts off them , please.At 14 , she 's also likely to be less sure of herself than you are , and thereforeless equipped to say no , and therefore you need to say it.And even if she were ready , which she is n't ( stadium-loudspeaker version : NOT-not-not READY-ready-ready ) , you 've got one foot out of the county and yourhormones are packing their bags . 
Whether you end it now or by fall or drag it toThanksgiving break , this jailbait joyride bears a striking resemblance to over.Many an excellent boyfriend has moved on with his life when appropriate . 
You getstripped of that title , though , if you allow yourselves -- allow her -- to getmuch more deeply entangled just as you head for the door.Dear Carolyn : I 'm 22 and have known this guy for about seven months now . 
When we first startedto get to know each other , I thought it was just going to be a friendship-typething . 
But as time went on he seemed to get more touchy . 
Like putting his armaround me , or telling me that he missed me . 
When we went out one time I think hetried to kiss me but I freaked out and kinda weaseled my way out of it , I hopewithout hurting his feelings . 
I 've never had a real boyfriend , and at the time <PERSON>Ijust</PERSON> did n't or could n't believe that he 'd be interested in me as a girlfriend.Now that we both have gotten busier and do n't see each other as often , Iconstantly think about him . 
The last time we talked he told me how his friendswanted to set him up on a blind date , and he was n't sure if he wanted to go ornot . 
All I said was , " Oh . " 
Does he not have any more interest ? 
Should I tell himhow I feel about him now , or do I just need a good kick in the head ? 
-- CluelessIt is axiomatic that the people who need a kick in the head are the ones whofancy themselves to be kick-proof . 
So you 're cool.But you 're right , a clue would n't hurt . 
You may realize that it was yourinexperience-slash-insecurity that made you duck this guy 's pucker , but unlessyou shared this fact with him , all he knows is that you ducked . 
Recoiled , even.He 's still asking himself if he had halitosis for the ages or if you find himrepulsive in general.Acquiring a little self-esteem would n't hurt , either . 
You " could n't believe " someone would like you ? 
Wow . 
Therapy?Meanwhile , his blind-date question could very well have been a covertreconnaissance operation : He checks again to see if you have any interest atall , but without risking the humiliation of another calamitous air-kiss . 
Yourcome-hither comeback being " Oh . 
" As long as we 're hip-deep in maybes , it 's also possible that you misunderstood , he did n't try to kiss you and he has harbored no romantic interest .
