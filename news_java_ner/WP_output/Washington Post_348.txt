STATE COLLEGE , <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION> - Of the half-dozen job interviews <PERSON>John Tecce</PERSON> has been onthis winter , the subject has come up every time , in some cases dominating theentire interview : How does <PERSON>Tecce</PERSON> , a senior marketing major at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> , viewthe child sex-abuse scandal that shook the university in <DATE>November</DATE> ? 
Does hefeel the university acted appropriately in firing football coach <PERSON>Joe Paternointhe</PERSON> scandal 's wake ? 
Where was <PERSON>Tecce</PERSON> on the night several thousand studentsrioted just off campus ? 
" You do n't know what 's going through [ the interviewer 's ] head , whether they see'Penn State ' on your rsum and assume the worst , " said <PERSON>Tecce</PERSON> , 22 , fromDowningtown , <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION> " Maybe you do n't know for sure that 's the reason they 're goingto deny you a job , but it " might be.This is a week for reflection at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> , as the campus , township of StateCollege and larger university community mourn the death of <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> , the iconic85-year-old patriarch of the school 's once-storied football program , from lungcancer on <DATE>Sunday</DATE> . 
<DATE>Wednesday</DATE> 's funeralhttp : / / www.washingtonpost.com/national/mourners-line-up-for-2nd-day-of-joe-paternos-public-viewing-funeral-set-for-afternoon/2012/01/25/gIQAJmJvPQ_story.html will be followed by a publicmemorial <DATE>Thursday</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Bryce Jordan Center</ORGANIZATION> . 
It is a week for contemplatinguniversal , big-picture themes : life , death , legacy , redemption , community.But for at least one group of <LOCATION>Penn Staters</LOCATION> - the thousands of seniors set tograduate in <DATE>May</DATE> - this is also a time for a very personal , self-centeredquestion : What does the scandal mean for my own future?As they meet with corporate recruiters and interview with prospective employers , <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> seniors in many cases are discovering the scandal - in which a formerassistant football coach , <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky</PERSON> , is charged with sexually abusing 10boys over a 15-year-period - is very much on the minds of the ones asking thequestions.Sally Chia , 22 , a public relations major from <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> , said she was interviewingwith <ORGANIZATION>General Electric</ORGANIZATION> shortly after the scandal broke in <DATE>November</DATE> when she wassurprised by a sudden turn in the line of questioning . 
" They asked how I felt about it , [ and ] what I would have done if I [ hadwitnessed an assault ] . 
I was caught off-guard , " <PERSON>Chia</PERSON> said . 
" When I did n't getthe job offer at first , I kept thinking , ' Maybe I could have answered thatquestion better . ' 
I do n't think it 's an appropriate question to ask just becausesomeone happens to be from <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> . 
We 're not to blame for something a formercoach did . 
" It was a line of questioning the university anticipated in the days followingthe scandal , as two high-ranking <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> officials were charged in an allegedcover-up and two other officials - including <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> - were fired for failing toact decisively enough . 
On the night of <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's dismissal , thousands ofstudents rioted.In those first few days , rumors were spreading rapidly that corporate recruiterswere shunning <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> students , or even rescinding job offers.In a <DATE>Nov. 11</DATE> letter to students and prospective employers , <PERSON>Jeff Garis</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>PennState</ORGANIZATION> 's senior director of career services , shot down those rumors and offeredsuggestions to students on how to deal with pointed questions during jobinterviews . 
" Students may acknowledge that they are primarily concerned for thevictims and also concerned for <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> in these troubling times , " <PERSON>Gariswrote</PERSON> . 
" However , students should keep the focus on . . . how they will excel inthe opportunity . 
" By many measures , <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> says it is doing just fine from a businessstandpoint in the wake of the scandal . 
In an address to the faculty senate thisweek , new president <PERSON>Rodney Erickson</PERSON> cited , among other things , a 3 percentincrease over <DATE>2010</DATE> in undergraduate-admissions applications and a 10 percentincrease in the sum of contributions to the school 's annual fund as proof of theuniversity 's overall health.Meanwhile , in an interview <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> at his office on the campus 's eastern edge , <PERSON>Garis</PERSON> also said his initial fears about a backlash from corporate recruitershave proved to be unfounded , citing a <PERCENT>15 percent</PERCENT> increase from <DATE>2010</DATE> in thenumber of companies attending <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> 's Spring Career Day - an increase Garisattributes largely to the improving economy . 
" This tells me employers are every bit as interested , or more , in recruitingPenn State students as before , " he said.Julie Rank , who recruits on college campuses for Brooksource , anIndianapolis-based IT staffing firm , said she still recruits <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> studentsas aggressively as before , and said the scandal is " not a topic that needs to bediscussed in a professional setting . " 
" That puts the students in a very awkward situation , " she said . 
" No intervieweesfrom other schools are having to answer those same questions . 
" But while <PERSON>Garis</PERSON> said he has received little indication that the <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> scandalhas been a hot topic during students ' job interviews , the students themselvestell a different <PERSON>story.Michael Higgins</PERSON> , 21 , a senior industrial engineering major from <LOCATION>Norristown</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION> , said of his four job interviews so far , three have included scandal questions.In one case , an interviewer noted an item on <PERSON>Higgins</PERSON> 's resume - he is vicepresident of " Paternoville , " an organization that represents the body ofstudents that camps out for tickets during home football weeks - and joked , " Ica n't believe you still have that on your rsum . " 
" I actually feel that [ questions about the scandal are ] a good starting point inan interview , " <PERSON>Higgins</PERSON> said . 
" It breaks the ice , and it kind of lets them knowwhat kind of person I am .
