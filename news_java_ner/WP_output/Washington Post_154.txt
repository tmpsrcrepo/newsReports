When it comes to crime , legalized casino gambling seemed to be a surprisinglygood bet : Local unemployment went down , tax revenue went up and crime did n'tincrease when a casino opened . 
Some researchers even found that crime declinedimmediately after casinos came to town.Well , the casino cure for crime proved to be just as delusional as gamblers ' luck , says <ORGANIZATION>University of Georgia</ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON>David B. Mustard.Mustard</PERSON> and <PERSON>Earl L. Grinols</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Baylor University</ORGANIZATION> analyzed crime data collectedfrom all 3,165 <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> counties in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> from <DATE>1977</DATE> to <DATE>1996</DATE> and lookedat local crime rates before and after casinos opened.They found that crime did n't budge when a casino began operating -- at leastat first . 
Crime began to rise after the first year , slowly at first and thenmore quickly , until it had far surpassed what it would have been if the casinohad never opened . 
By the fifth year of operation , robberies were up <PERCENT>136 percent</PERCENT> ; aggravated assaults , <PERCENT>91 percent</PERCENT> ; auto theft , <PERCENT>78 percent</PERCENT> ; burglary , <PERCENT>50 percent</PERCENT> ; larceny , <PERCENT>38 percent</PERCENT> ; and rape , <PERCENT>21 percent</PERCENT> . 
Controlling for other factors , <PERCENT>8.6 percent</PERCENT> of property crimes and <PERCENT>12.6 percent</PERCENT> of violent crimes were attributedto casinos , he said.But what about all those casino jobs and newly minted police ? 
Mustard said thepositive effects of casinos are fleeting -- payrolls and tax collectionsquickly plateau , and municipalities do n't keep adding cops after the first waveof casino tax revenue rolls in.What 's more , <ORGANIZATION>Mustard</ORGANIZATION> said , crime rates did n't rise in neighboring counties whilethey soared in casino counties -- evidence that casinos create crime locallyand do n't merely attract it from somewhere else.And here 's sobering news for those in the District and <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> who thinkcasinos would jump-start the local economies : " Even using conservative estimatesof costs and generous estimates of benefits , we still find the costs exceed thebenefits , " Mustard said.Who supports terrorism in the <LOCATION>Middle East ?</LOCATION> 
Not the people you 'd expect , according to <PERSON>Dalia Mogahed</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>Gallup Organization</ORGANIZATION> . 
Surveys in eight Muslimcountries revealed that supporters of terrorism -- defined as those whoapplauded the <DATE>Sept. 11 , 2001</DATE> , attacks -- were no more religious than otherMuslims and tended to be better-educated and more affluent.The polls found those who regularly attended prayer services were no more likelyto back terrorism than those who did not . 
Nor were Muslims who agreed thatreligion " was an important part of your daily life . 
" About <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> of all Muslims with higher-than-average incomes supported theSept . 
11 attacks -- slightly more than those who had below-average incomes orwere poor . 
Among high school or college graduates , <PERCENT>44 percent</PERCENT> held extremistviews , compared with <PERCENT>38 percent</PERCENT> of less-educated Muslims . 
And the unemployedwere no more likely to back terrorism than those who worked full time , accordingto the poll of 8,000 Muslims in October.What did distinguish terrorism supporters ? 
Belief in self-determination , <LOCATION>Mogahedfound</LOCATION> . 
Extremists were only about half as likely as moderates to believe thatthe <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> would allow people in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> to fashion their ownpolitical future.A new record : More than 1,000 people participated in our latest onlineexperiment -- on the first day alone .
