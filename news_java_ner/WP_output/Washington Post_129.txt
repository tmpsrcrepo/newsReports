Do n't let yourself get " assistant-ized . 
" It 's one of the many perils of being a young woman in today 's job market , HannahSeligson warns in her new book , " New Girl on the Job : Advice From the Trenches " ( <ORGANIZATION>Citadel Press</ORGANIZATION> , <MONEY>$ 19.95</MONEY> ) . 
There are enough issues that specifically affect young women -- such as salarynegotiations and the tendency to pigeonhole women into support rather thanleadership roles -- that she felt they deserved their own career guide , she saidin an interview.Seligson , an <LOCATION>Alexandria</LOCATION> native , is n't too far from thosewondering-if-you-look-like-alittle-girl-playing-dress-up-in-a-suit days herself . 
" New Girl " is a look at what she learned from her mistakes as well as guidancefrom other women -- some young , some at the top of their field such as cosmeticsmaven <PERSON>Bobbi Brown</PERSON> , television journalist <PERSON>Soledad O'Brien</PERSON> , and <PERSON>Jill Herzig</PERSON> , executive editor of Glamour magazine . 
It 's a practical addition to a fieldcrowded with plenty of navel-gazing angst . 
" New Girl " covers the key things that any young woman needs to know to thriveat those first couple of jobs , including : Asking for feedback . 
No , this is n't a sign of weakness , <PERSON>Seligson</PERSON> says . 
It 's oneof the most effective ways to get better at your job . 
Constructive criticismis n't a personal attack , so do n't take it as such . 
Solicit feedback in aninformal , ongoing way to keep from getting " sandbagged " -- " when a supervisor ora boss hurls a litany of complaints at you with little warning . . . which ismore likely to occur if you wait until your year-end review to get feedback fromyour boss , " <PERSON>Seligson</PERSON> writes.Responding to sexual harassment . 
Despite great advances in women 's rights , sexual harassment still limits women 's progress at work . 
<PERSON>Seligson</PERSON> 's advice isno-nonsense and straightforward : " If a situation with a male co-worker leads youto contemplate quitting your job or transferring divisions , or is preventing youfrom operating at full throttle , it 's probably time to seek an intervention . 
" The flip side to that is to curb your own flirtiness . 
When you 're young , it ' seasy to think , " Hey , I 'm cute , why not work that for all it 's worth ? " 
But in thelong run , it could backfire . 
" Oprah Winfrey certainly did n't get where she istoday because she used her sexuality , and she 's not the only one , " Seligsonwrites.Moving on . 
Young women often hang on to jobs for way too long , even jobs wherethey are grossly overworked and under-compensated . 
It 's as if they are afraid toleave . 
But staying put comes at a cost . 
" By staying in a job that makes youmiserable or in which your skills and talents are n't utilized , you are losingprecious months -- or even years -- that could be spent in a job for whichyou 're better suited . . . . There is a difference between paying your dues andworking at a job you hate , " she writes . 
( She 's onto something . 
I often gete-mails from people who are terrified of how their boss will react when theyhand in their two weeks ' notice at their entry-level jobs . 
Those people arenever men . ) 
Negotiating for raises . 
The persistent pay gap between men and women ( includingright out of college , according to one recent study ) makes this an issue allyoung women should pay attention to . 
Seligson nails the problem with areference to what negotiating experts <PERSON>Carol Frohlinger</PERSON> and <PERSON>Deborah Kolb</PERSON> call the " tiara syndrome " -- " when you keep your head down and do your work and expectthat someone will notice you and put a tiara on your head . " 
It does n't work.Young women must stick up for themselves in pay negotiations , for their ownbenefit and because self-confidence is perceived as an asset to employers.Digging Out of a RutDo you fear that you 're being " assistant-ized , " or stuck in an entry-level joblonger than you should be ?
