A more forlorn piece of property you will not find than <PERSON>Don Kreuzer</PERSON> 's patch , onthe northwest corner of the intersection of 23rd Street , F Street and VirginiaAvenue , in Foggy Bottom . 
It is right on the edge of the <ORGANIZATION>George WashingtonUniversity</ORGANIZATION> campus -- and that 's not a minor geographic detail : It 's the wholeexplosive problem.Kreuzer 's ( rhymes with " cruisers " ) three row houses are nice enough : a stout,two-story brick structure on the corner , which Kreuzer lives in ; and twoslightly dingier houses , one green , one white , attached on the north side , whichhe rents out . 
The catch is , there 's nothing anywhere near them . 
Almosteverything else on the block has been razed , 26 town houses in all . 
The churnedearth of freshly empty lots , flecked with broken bricks and shards of concrete , stretches out all around . 
A lone telephone pole pokes up woozily out of thewasteland . 
Given how provisional the scene looks , you half-expect the wreckingball jockeys to be back tomorrow , to finish the job.The wrecking ball is n't coming back , but the construction workers are . 
Kreuzerwas the last holdout when <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> bought up the block in the '90s . 
Soon , a 10-floorsuperdorm , with room for more than 700 students , is going up all but flushagainst his property -- not exactly a homeowner 's dream.Kreuzer , a slim dentist with a round face and boyishly cut gray hair , contendsthat <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> bought the land in an underhanded manner . 
" They basically isolated me , " he recalls . 
" They turned one neighbor against another . 
They swore individuals tosecrecy . " 
But what really gets him is that the <ORGANIZATION>District of Columbia</ORGANIZATION> governmenthad ordered the university not to expand onto his block . 
GW officials " weretold , dictated , mandated to keep their hands off it , " he says . 
It 's true : In1988 , the city <ORGANIZATION>Board of Zoning Adjustment</ORGANIZATION> decreed that the block was a crucialbuffer between the university and the neighborhood.University officials are unapologetic about their failure to respect the bufferzone . 
Any private developer , they argue , could have purchased the houses andtorn them down . 
Besides , they say , the buffer idea was always silly , because itwas mostly <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> students who lived on the block anyway , paying rent to absenteelandlords , who all got good deals when they sold their run-down houses . 
Kreuzerjust set too high a price , <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> officials say , so they had to build around him.Welcome to real estate hardball.Now District of <ORGANIZATION>Columbia</ORGANIZATION> planners and zoners have decided they 've heard one toomany stories about <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> 's pushing its neighbors around . 
The acquisition of landoutside the campus boundaries , as in the Kreuzer case , is one touchy issue.Another is the steady flow of <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> students into apartment buildings near thecampus , where their partying and irregular hours disturb longtime residents.Trying to rein in the university and its expansionist president , <PERSON>Stephen JoelTrachtenberg</PERSON> , the zoning board in <DATE>December</DATE> set strict minimums on the proportionof students <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> must house within its existing campus boundaries . 
The ordereffectively compels <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> to start building dorms on land it already owns -- notbuying up any more property in the neighborhood -- or else . 
If the universitybalks , it wo n't be allowed to build so much as a one-room shack anywhere on thecampus : no labs , no libraries , no new classrooms.Under <ORGANIZATION>Trachtenberg</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> has been all about growth . 
Since his arrival in <DATE>1988</DATE> , hehas accelerated the university 's transformation from a commuter college andgraduate-degree resource for government workers into a would-be top-100 researchinstitution . 
He has done it by bringing in more students paying more money , which has in turn financed more and nicer facilities , which has in turn broughtin better students paying more money.Anyone who has strolled lately through the <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> campus can testify to the changes.It once looked like a random collection of buildings ; you could cross it withoutrealizing you 'd even been on a campus . 
Now there 's a picturesque quad ringed byfiligreed iron gates ; new buildings left and right ; the thrum of student life inall its backpacked , nose-pierced glory.Growth has been the engine driving the improvement , but now the city has throwna wrench into it , and <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> is fighting back . 
In <DATE>January</DATE> the university sued toblock the zoning board 's order . 
The case 's outcome could alter not just thelandscape of what 's left of Foggy Bottom , but the arc of development for anup-and-coming university for years to come.If <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> 's history over the <DATE>last decade</DATE> has been one of rapid growth , its firstcentury was marked by grand designs and hopes all too often deferred or quashed.GW was <ORGANIZATION>Columbian College</ORGANIZATION> at first , its charter granted by <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1821</DATE> andsigned by President <PERSON>James Monroe</PERSON> . 
Its first campus was not in Foggy Bottom , butbetween 14th and 15th streets NW , north of <LOCATION>Florida Avenue</LOCATION> . 
It was a Baptistinstitution , founded by ministers who first had to convince their colleaguesthat a college was compatible with virtue : Respectable thought had its doubtsabout sending impressionable young men away from home to live together.Small enrollments and a succession of cash crises were the main story for thefirst century . 
A medical school opened downtown in <DATE>1825</DATE> , and the college itselfmoved to 15th and H streets NW in the <DATE>1880s</DATE> . 
In <DATE>1904</DATE> , the college became theGeorge <ORGANIZATION>Washington University</ORGANIZATION> , and in <DATE>1912</DATE> it established a beachhead at 20th andG streets , its first incursion into Foggy Bottom . 
<ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> 's 15th president , <PERSON>CloydHeck Marvin</PERSON> , was a sort of proto-Trachtenberg , holding sway from <DATE>1927</DATE> to 1959and adding nine major structures to the campus , that growth fueled by an influxof GI Bill students . 
<PERSON>Lloyd Elliott</PERSON> , a courtly , shy man who served as presidentfrom <DATE>1965</DATE> to <DATE>1988</DATE> , built up the campus further and laid down some importantmarkers in the quest for academic greatness . 
Then , in <DATE>1988</DATE> , came HurricaneSteve.The new president had a mandate . 
" When <PERSON>Trachtenberg</PERSON> came to <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> , he felt , and alot of people felt , that it was better than its reputation , " says <PERSON>Jeffrey Henig</PERSON> , chair of the department of political science and director of the Center forWashington Area Studies . 
" The trustees strongly supported the idea that weneeded someone to toot our horn . 
" <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> 's limited renown had hurt student recruitment , among other things . 
In <DATE>1988</DATE> , the university attracted 5,900 applicants and admitted more than <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> ofthem . 
Almost all of the applicants came from a thin sliver of the <LOCATION>East Coast</LOCATION> , and even within that sliver there were gaps : One high school on Long Islandwould send half a dozen students to <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> each year , while the guidance counselorin the school the next town over had never heard of the place . 
The rare timesthe phone rang in the public affairs office , it was often a reporter who hadmeant to call Georgetown.Trachtenberg was nothing if not a horn-tooter . 
He was coming off an 11-yearstint at <ORGANIZATION>the University of Hartford</ORGANIZATION> , where he 'd charmed his way into the walletsof his institution 's previously apathetic alumni , thereby putting thatinstitution on a newly solid footing . 
GW faculty members were a bit nervous , already convinced that it was n't an academic 's heart that beat in his breast , but that of a marketing-mad MBA ( in fact , his graduate degrees are in law , fromYale , and public administration , from <LOCATION>Harvard</LOCATION> ) . 
He quickly got himself intotrouble with them by quipping that he viewed the <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> job as basically that of CEOof " a conglomerate " that offered housing , food services , athletics , bookstoresand health facilities . 
" And on the side , " he added , " we do a little education . 
" From the moment he and his Fortune 100 ego stepped onto the campus , there wasspeculation about what his next aspiration would be . 
Politics , a la WoodrowWilson , one-time Princeton president ? 
A bigger university?Here 's the funny thing about all that talk . 
More and more , it 's looking as ifTrachtenberg is a lifer . 
He is in the penultimate year of his contract andtalking about signing on for another five years , which would take him through toage 70 . 
It 's starting to make a lot more sense to think about his legacy thanhis next step.In fact , he says , he has come to realize it takes a decade to get traction as auniversity president ; he feels he has really hit his stride only in the last fewyears . 
He 's leaning back on a leather couch in an anteroom to his office , wearing dark banker 's pinstripes fit snugly on his fireplug body . 
His roundwire-rims look tiny on his sizable head , below close-cropped gray hair . 
" I cando things with a phone call that would have taken me two weeks when I arrived , " he says . 
" I know people and they know me . 
I 've been to weddings and funerals andbar mitzvahs and christenings , and I 've been with people in their happy timesand their sad times . 
So there 's a universe of colleagues , associates , favorsasked , favors done . 
All of which come together to give you a resource that ca n'tbe rushed . 
" Long before he built up that useful network , <PERSON>Trachtenberg</PERSON> identified a basicfiscal problem at <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> . 
It charged a lot less for tuition than schools it hoped torival , such as Northwestern or <ORGANIZATION>New York University</ORGANIZATION> , and it was top-heavy withgraduate students . 
Grad students are well and good ( advancing the state of humanknowledge and all that ) , but , except in the professional schools , they do n'thelp much with the bottom line , because they tend to get scholarships . 
Tuitionis especially important for <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> because of its relatively meager endowment ( <MONEY>$ 713million</MONEY> , compared with <ORGANIZATION>NYU</ORGANIZATION> 's <MONEY>$ 1.1 billion</MONEY> or <ORGANIZATION>Northwestern</ORGANIZATION> 's <MONEY>$ 3.3 billion</MONEY> ) . 
Sofrom <DATE>1988</DATE> to <DATE>2001</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> raised its tuition and fees from <MONEY>$ 9,771</MONEY> to <MONEY>$ 26,140</MONEY> , morethan double the rate of inflation . 
Since <DATE>1998</DATE> alone , the number of full-timeundergraduates has swelled from 6,525 to 8,459 . 
The university , meanwhile , houses only about half of those students in dormitories . 
That 's what has caughtthe eye of neighbors and , more recently , city planners and the zoning board.Thanks to aggressive recruitment , a seller 's market overall in collegeadmissions and ( who knows ? ) 
maybe the men 's basketball team 's <DATE>1993</DATE> visit to theSweet 16 in the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> tournament , <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> now enrolls students from across the country ( <LOCATION>North Dakota</LOCATION> , the last state to fall , first sent someone in <DATE>1997</DATE> ) . 
Last year GWattracted 16,000 applicants -- a 170 percent increase since <DATE>1988</DATE> -- and acceptedonly <PERCENT>49 percent</PERCENT> of them . 
Despite worries about what the terrorist attacks woulddo to high schoolers ' appetite for universities in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> , applications are up once more , and the acceptance rate might drop again.Meanwhile , former students are being hit up as they never have been : <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> is inthe midst of a <MONEY>$ 500 million</MONEY> capital campaign , its largest such endeavor ever , and has raised the proportion of undergraduate alumni who give to the universityfrom a laggardly <PERCENT>16 percent</PERCENT> to a Georgetown-rivaling 32 percent.Trachtenberg used some of the supply of cash to tackle thecollege-without-a-campus problem . 
In addition to <PERSON>Kogan Plaza</PERSON> , the somewhatprefabricated-looking campus quad , paved on one end with bricks bearing thenames of alumni , there is the spruce <MONEY>$ 27 million</MONEY> <ORGANIZATION>School of Media</ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION>PublicAffairs</LOCATION> , opened last <DATE>spring</DATE> . 
It 's got a television studio ( complete with falseWashington backdrop ) and an interview room from which <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> professors ' bons motscan be beamed directly to news shows . 
Even more important to today 's hard-bodycollegians , a <MONEY>$ 37 million</MONEY> , four-story Taj Mahal of a fitness center debuted inAugust . 
A glass-skinned modernist addition to the student center is in theworks , as is a new home for the <ORGANIZATION>Elliott School of International Relations.Trachtenberg</ORGANIZATION> 's critics tag him as a real estate mogul and an empire builder . 
Hescoffs at the name-calling , but it turns out that he does have a philosophy ofbackhoes and cranes . 
" You need to have something under construction , " he says , in the same patient tone you might use to explain to a child that his petgoldfish needs to stay in the water . 
" Having something under construction sendsa nonverbal signal to people that all is well at the institution . 
It gives thema sense of promise , and of the future . 
" Not content with building on his dense urban campus , Tracht-enberg went out andbought a more picturesque one . 
Since <DATE>1996</DATE> <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> has owned the grounds and buildingsof Mount <PERSON>Vernon College</PERSON> , the former all-women 's school in the tony <ORGANIZATION>NorthwestWashington neighborhood of Foxhall</ORGANIZATION> , near <ORGANIZATION>Georgetown University</ORGANIZATION> . 
Immediately , newathletic fields and tennis courts sprouted there , and more than 250 <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> studentsnow live on the old <LOCATION>Mount Vernon</LOCATION> campus . 
It 's not clear whether all this will bea coup ( as some Georgetown professors think , since they were eyeing the land forthemselves ) , or , as the president himself has ruefully joked , " Trachtenberg ' sFolly . 
" Even faculty critics turned off by <ORGANIZATION>Trachtenberg</ORGANIZATION> 's style are happy theirinstitution is on the move . 
Professors may roll their eyes upon hearing thatCNN 's " Crossfire " is going to be broadcasting five nights a week from the newmedia and public affairs building -- another potential PR coup -- or uponlearning that <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> has just unveiled a new corporate-style logo and typeface . 
Butthey are excited about a new plan to single out , through a competitive process , certain programs and departments and reward them with extra money , as a way ofbolstering <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> 's academic stature . 
" When I got here 15 years ago , " says <PERSON>Jarol B. Manheim</PERSON> , interim director of <ORGANIZATION>theSchool of Media and Public Affairs</ORGANIZATION> , " GW was a sleepy place with run-downfacilities , with students who did n't want to be here . . . There was n't much ofa sense of direction . " 
Trachtenberg , he adds , " turned it around . " 
" I do n't think there 's a person in the world who could have done a better job inthat time period with this university , " <PERSON>Manheim</PERSON> says.Certainly , there have been some false steps . 
<ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> 's tight finances sometimes forceTrachtenberg to do some fancy dancing . 
In the mid-1990s that included siphoningwhat the <ORGANIZATION>American Bar Association</ORGANIZATION> determined was an unseemly amount of moneyfrom the <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> law school , for the benefit of the rest of the university . 
Thenthere was the sordid sexual-assault charge against a basketball player two yearsago and some minor <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> violations , a reminder that big-time sports , whichTrachtenberg had hoped would boost school spirit and keep <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> 's name on TV , canalso turn around and bite you , hard . 
While professors complain that there is n'tenough scholarship money to lure top graduate students , undergraduates complainabout an array of fees tucked into the tuition bill , from special line items forthe media and public affairs building and the fitness center to a <MONEY>$ 50</MONEY> voluntarylibrary charge . 
" The campus joke , " says <PERSON>Russ Rizzo</PERSON> , editor in chief of the GWHatchet , the student newspaper , " is that they 're eventually going to put coinmachines on the stalls in the bathrooms . 
" Undergraduates have also been frustrated over <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> 's ever-increasing enrollment , and their resentment hit a new high last year . 
" A lot of students thought theuniversity should be looking to reduce the incoming class so that academicfacilities would be enough for the students who are here , " says <PERSON>Roger Kapoor</PERSON> , asenior and president of the <ORGANIZATION>GW Student Association</ORGANIZATION> . 
Students also suffer thegeneralized anxiety that comes from attending a school that 's changing so fast : Is my tuition going to help me , or the class of 2010 ? 
It would be ironic if , after surviving potshots from journalists , professors andcarping students over the years , <PERSON>Stephen Joel Trachtenberg</PERSON> were laid low bysomething so mundane as zoning regulations.In some corners of Foggy Bottom , <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> 's president inspires heated language . 
" Asalesman , " " ruthless , " " uncouth " and " a con artist " are among the terms offeredby <PERSON>John Graves</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> class of <DATE>' 51</DATE> , Foggy Bottom resident and longtimeanti-expansion activist . 
<PERSON>Maria Tyler</PERSON> , an advisory neighborhood commissioner inFoggy Bottom , draws on her childhood experiences in <LOCATION>Lithuania</LOCATION> . 
" I have livedthrough two dictatorships -- communism and Nazism , " she says . 
" And now I am in athird dictatorship -- and that is <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> ! 
" <PERSON>Trachtenberg</PERSON> , of course , sees the real estate dispute differently . 
" A smallhandful of neighbors who are extreme in their views have seized the moment andhave gotten hold of the process , " he says in his trademark brusque , Brooklynesque manner . 
" They spend a lot of time worrying about the issue anddriving the process and using all of its mechanisms , while the rest of thepeople go about their lives . 
And because we are like Gulliver we get caught upin the process . 
We find ourselves bound to the ground . 
And so we need lawyers toliberate us . 
" <PERSON>Sara Maddux</PERSON> , a longtime <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> employee and Foggy Bottom activist , thinks the over-the-top rhetoric aimed at <ORGANIZATION>Trachtenberg</ORGANIZATION> hurts the cause . 
Adiminutive woman with shocks of gray in her dark hair , she offered to provide a " rational view " of <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> 's effects on the neighborhood during a walking tour ofFoggy Bottom , a near-circuit of the campus . 
In the first couple of blocks alone , she was able to point out a fine art-deco-tinged dorm that had once been anapartment building ; a white Greek Revival structure formerly home to a privateclub , now <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> 's headquarters for entertaining visiting alumni ; a string ofacquired town houses ; two independent apartment buildings that have weathered aninflux of students . 
In the <DATE>last 17 years</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> has acquired 35 local buildings , not counting the ones taken down on Kreuzer 's block.Maddux had an eye not just for lost structures , but for other departedamenities , like the affordable restaurant once in the first floor of the FrancisScott Key Hotel . 
" We miss that , " she said . 
" We 've lost our small businesses , ourrestaurants , our grocery stores . 
There 's only one grocery store in the area now -- and that 's in the <LOCATION>Watergate</LOCATION> , which is quite a hike , especially for elderlypeople . " 
There are only about 12,000 registered voters in Foggy Bottom , comparedwith the nearly 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students at GW.Maddux put me in touch with <PERSON>Ron Cocome</PERSON> , who has personally felt the effects ofGW 's expansion . 
He lived for 14 years in <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Plaza</ORGANIZATION> , a massive , monolithicapartment complex across <LOCATION>Virginia Avenue</LOCATION> from Kreuzer 's houses . 
Its scale andutilitarian appearance hint at its origins in an urban-redevelopment project , one designed to attract and keep middle-income residents in Foggy Bottom . 
Therehad always been a few students in <ORGANIZATION>Columbia Plaza</ORGANIZATION> , but in <DATE>1997</DATE> , by Cocome ' sreckoning , the trickle became a stream . 
" It was n't that they were bad kids , " hesays , " but they acted like the building was a dormitory . 
Worse than a dormitory : an unregulated dormitory . " 
Packs of guys would return from bars at <TIME>2 a.m.</TIME> andbang on their friends ' doors , balcony parties became an all-hours phenomenon . 
" Idid n't care about the physical deterioration of the building . 
People talkedabout the ambience of the place , but I did n't care about that . 
But if you ca n'tcome home in peace after a full day 's work and read a book and listen to somemusic without being disturbed , that 's a problem . 
" By the time we moved out , if you got one good night 's sleep in 10 , you werelucky . " 
He fled in <DATE>2000</DATE> . 
<PERSON>Marilyn Rubin</PERSON> , the president of the tenantsassociation , says things have only gotten worse.When people like <PERSON>Sara Maddux</PERSON> talk about the way Foggy Bottom used to be , theytend to refer to the place as it was in the <DATE>1950s</DATE> , when it lured moderate-incomeworkers , mostly government types , through its proximity to downtown . 
But FoggyBottom has been through significant changes since the university first arrivedin <DATE>1912</DATE> . 
Then , the neighborhood was an industrial quadrant , anchored by limekilns , breweries and a gas works . 
Massive gas tanks dominated the skyline.Over the next 50 years , the swampland to the south was filled in , creating theentire west end of the <ORGANIZATION>Mall</ORGANIZATION> , anti-slum legislation cleaned up a network ofback-alley shacks , and the <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> was installed ( in <DATE>1947</DATE> ) . 
From the <DATE>1940s</DATE> to the <DATE>'60s</DATE> , Foggy Bottom flipped from being a majority-black , working-class neighborhood to an overwhelmingly white , middle-class precinct.And in <DATE>the second half of the century</DATE> , elephantine projects , including theWatergate , the <ORGANIZATION>Kennedy Center</ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON>Theodore Roosevelt</PERSON> Bridge sliced up theneighborhood 's western end in awkward , pedestrian-unfriendly ways . 
" Ironically , " says <PERSON>Jeffrey Henig</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>GW Center for Washington Area Studies</ORGANIZATION> , " when there were periods of disinvestment and crime , and environmental concerns , the university 's growth helped Foggy Bottom a lot . 
" <PERSON>Trachtenberg</PERSON> puts things less diplomatically : " When <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> came to Foggy Bottom , itwas a collection of breweries and coal chutes . 
And we took a gamble . 
We believewe are largely responsible for the condition that the Foggy Bottom area is intoday -- the very positive condition that the residents celebrate . " 
" One hesitates to sound like a child and say , ' We were here first , ' " he adds . 
" But the record shows that we were here first . 
" If <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> was once a stabilizer , is it now a major disrupter ? 
Both sides brandishdata to make their case . 
<ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> touts the money its students pump into the economy ; its scholarships going to <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> high school students ; its status as the city ' sbiggest private employer ; the countless soup ladles handled by studentvolunteers . 
On the neighborhood activists ' side , a retired business professorwho lives in the <LOCATION>Watergate</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Sol Shalit</PERSON> , has been cranking out papers documentingthe revenue loss each time a <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> purchase takes a building off the <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> taxrolls.Interestingly , economic effects are n't something zoning officials can considerwhen they evaluate a university 's use of land . 
Their mandate is evaluatingwhether <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> 's existence has become " objectionable to neighboring property becauseof noise , traffic , number of students , " or other bothersome traits . 
In <DATE>2000</DATE> , thecity planning office concluded that <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> had , indeed , become objectionable . 
Itsaid the neighborhood was at a " tipping point " : If something was n't done , FoggyBottom would simply disappear . 
Left behind would be one big campus.Hence the stringent new rules . 
By <DATE>2006</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> has to house <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of itsfull-time undergraduates on its core campus . 
The <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> applies to the first8 ,000 students ; beyond that , every additional student must be housed . 
There aretough interim requirements , too . 
By next <DATE>fall</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> has to house <PERCENT>70 percent</PERCENT> of itsstudents either on its campus or entirely outside Foggy Bottom . 
" We 're notopposed to a university 's expansion -- that 's not even a question , " says AndrewAltman , the athletic-looking , sleepy-eyed director of the city 's planningoffice , who came to <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> in <DATE>1999</DATE> after a successful tenure in a similar job inOakland . 
" The question is , How do you account for the cost of growth ? " 
" We did n't go out and invent standards " for judging <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> , he says . 
" We applied theexisting , established regulatory framework . 
The difference was that we did applyit . " 
Previous campus plans , he suggests , were rubber-stamped , <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> 's proposalsevaluated purely from the perspective of the university 's needs.The legal battle ahead is a complex one . 
GW argues that the city has no right tokeep its students out of apartment buildings in Foggy Bottom ; under <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> ' ssweeping human rights law , it is illegal to discriminate against students . 
Theuniversity argues , too , that there is no direct connection between thepunishment ( a ban on future construction ) and the problem ( a need for moredorms ) . 
And <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> says the whole thing is marked by arbitrariness : randompercentages , an unfair failure to count several apartment buildings that <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> nowowns ( but that lie outside the campus boundaries ) as university-sponsoredhousing . 
Local and national educational groups have joined with <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> , arguing thatthe university alone should decide whether to spend its limited resources ondorms or labs or professors ' salaries . 
It 's going to be a long haul : Both sidesare already looking past the decision in this round of the case , to appeals andbeyond.The easiest way to think about the issue might be as a battle of analogies : IsGW like a sports arena that draws thousands and thousands of people into aneighborhood , but fails to provide parking or to take responsibility for thefans ' behavior ? 
Or is this more like a civil rights case : Is limiting the numberof <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> students in private apartments in Foggy Bottom really very different fromhanging up signs reading " No Blacks Allowed " ? 
The people who are caught in the crossfire seem to grasp the situation ' snuances . 
That is , the students . 
On an ebulliently sunny <DATE>February</DATE> day , threesophomores on <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> 's new quad talked cynically about <ORGANIZATION>Trachtenberg</ORGANIZATION> 's marketingschemes . 
" They have to realize it 's not about making <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> a ' brand name . ' 
It ' sabout us , " said <PERSON>Caroline Park.They</PERSON> had their stories to tell about clashes with angry residents . 
" They do notlike us , " said <PERSON>Alicia Stauffer</PERSON> , who lives in an apartment-building-turned-dormthat still has a handful of longtime tenants . 
One recently refused to let herinto the building after she approached the entrance behind him without her key ; instead he began shouting at her about <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> 's evil ways.The three students , however , could empathize with people who 'd lived in FoggyBottom for decades , watching the university grow like a spreading ink blot . 
" Youcan feel for them , " said <PERSON>Caitlin Caporale</PERSON> . 
Still , they had doubts about thecity 's demands . 
No one wanted to commute to campus from a satellite dorm in , say , <LOCATION>Chinatown</LOCATION> . 
No one wanted to see the price of new residence halls reflectedon a tuition bill that is almost as steep as <ORGANIZATION>Harvard 's</ORGANIZATION> . 
As they saw it , the interests of residents and students dovetailed : Limitingenrollment would mean smaller classes , more attention from professors -- evenbeing able to grab a snack when you wanted one , instead of having to wait inline for 20 minutes . 
" One thing that counts in the ratings " -- like the annualranking published by <ORGANIZATION>U.S. News & World Report</ORGANIZATION> -- " is selectivity , " Caporalesaid . 
" They could work on improving that . 
They could also work on improvingalumni giving , so we do n't have to rely so much on tuition . " 
" It 's just common sense , " she said , " that enrolling more people causes problemsfor the people already here , " whether students or residents.Is there a touch of financial naivete in such thoughts ? 
Perhaps , but it wasrefreshing to hear someone who was at least trying to understand the otherside 's view , especially after hearing <PERSON>Trachtenberg</PERSON> dismiss local activists ' arguments as " emotional , " and hearing them denounce him as a quasi-Nazi . 
To be fair , <PERSON>Trachtenberg</PERSON> has his empathetic moments . 
But then he 's back barkingthat " cities change , " and offering the following impolitic historical example : " We all know the story , " he says , " of <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> once being an island full of , presumably , forest primeval . 
" <PERSON>Don Kreuzer</PERSON> and his fellow residents of Foggy Bottom -- the natives in the woods -- are hardly likely to be soothed by such talk , preferring to view theirneighborhood as something more than virgin land awaiting settlement . 
And so theanimosity hardens . 
Cities may change , but the relation between <ORGANIZATION>GW</ORGANIZATION> and some ofits neighbors is stuck in a rut.Christopher <LOCATION>Shea</LOCATION> writes frequently for the Magazine .
