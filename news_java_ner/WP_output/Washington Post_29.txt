<PERSON>Jim McCloskey</PERSON> stands by the phone in a <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> hotel room on this frostyJanuary morning , waiting to fulfill a solemn pledge he made 14 years ago to acondemned man.An hour before <PERSON>Roger Keith Coleman</PERSON> was executed for rape and murder , McCloskeyhad locked eyes with him through the bars of his cell a few yards from theelectric chair and promised that someday he would prove <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's innocence.McCloskey is a lion of a man -- proud , powerful and self-assured -- but heemerged from death row that night in <DATE>May 1992</DATE> looking drained and frail as herepeated his pledge before dozens of reporters and television cameras , and readout <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's last words : " An innocent man is going to be murdered tonight . 
When my innocence is proven , Ihope Americans will realize the injustice of the death penalty as all othercivilized countries have . 
" An unordained Presbyterian minister and self-ordained seeker of truth , McCloskeyruns a small nonprofit organization that investigates cases of prisoners whoclaim they were wrongly accused . 
Over the years , he and his dedicated band havefreed 36 people , many of whom had spent decades behind bars for crimes theydid n't commit . 
It was too late to free <PERSON>Roger Coleman</PERSON> -- the electric chair hasno reverse switch -- but not too late to prove his innocence . 
For sitting in alocked evidence freezer in a lab in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> was less than a Q-Tip 's worth ofsemen taken from the body of the dead woman.McCloskey had petitioned <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON>Mark Warner</PERSON> to permit a new test of thesample 's DNA . 
No sitting governor had ever agreed to allow DNA testing of analready executed man . 
And no one who has been executed since the death penaltywas reinstituted in <DATE>1976</DATE> has been proved definitively innocent.Now , as he waits for the phone to ring with the DNA results , <ORGANIZATION>McCloskey</ORGANIZATION> is wellaware that history is looking over his shoulder . 
He 's rented a small conferenceroom at the <LOCATION>Berkeley Hotel</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> to receive the phone call from the crimelab and a larger room to hold a press conference afterward . 
He 's even agreed toallow a crew from <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> 's " Nightline " to be there to record his reaction to thenews . 
He 's written out two statements -- one in case <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> is exonerated , the other in case he is n't . 
But <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> is confident he will need only thefirst . 
Finally , at <TIME>10:45 a.m.</TIME> the call comes . 
" <PERSON>Jim</PERSON> , we have the results , " saysRay Prime , director of the <ORGANIZATION>Center of Forensic Sciences</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> , one of theworld 's most highly regarded crime labs.The " Nightline " camera captures the rest . 
" Uh-huh , he is the source , " saysMcCloskey . 
" Uh-huh , one in 19 million . " 
A heavy sigh . 
" Oh boy . 
All right . 
Bye . 
" He hangs up and turns to <PERSON>Paul Enzinna</PERSON> , the <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> attorney who helped himmake his appeal for DNA testing . 
" He 's guilty . 
" SIX WEEKS LATER , SITTING IN HIS ETERNALLY CLUTTERED OFFICE IN <LOCATION>PRINCETON</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Jim McCloskey</PERSON> is still perplexed . 
" I do n't argue at all with the DNA results , " he says , " but there are elements to this case that are still a mystery to me . 
" Part of the puzzle is the circumstances of the crime . 
McCloskey still seesnagging holes in the prosecution 's case . 
Chief among them is the timeline : Heca n't figure out how <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> had enough time to rape and murder hissister-in-law <PERSON>Wanda McCoy</PERSON> and still be seen in various places by various peoplethat <DATE>March</DATE> evening in <DATE>1981</DATE> . 
He still harbors strong suspicions about a neighborof the murder victim whom he believes had the character , motive and opportunityto commit the crime.And part of it is the convicted killer himself . 
Soft-spoken and thoughtful , <PERSON>Roger Coleman</PERSON> had presented his case calmly and articulately , with logicalexplanations and apparent sincerity . 
He also was a model prisoner who founded aprogram to counsel young men in trouble . 
He convinced not only <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> , aself-taught and experienced investigator with a skeptical nose . 
He also won theadmiration and affection of three strong , intelligent women.Foremost among them was <PERSON>Kathleen Behan</PERSON> , an attorney with <ORGANIZATION>Arnold & Porter</ORGANIZATION> , thehigh-powered <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> law firm that pursued <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's legal appeal without feefor eight years . 
There was <PERSON>Marie Deans</PERSON> , who headed a small shoestring operationthat counseled and comforted <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's death row inmates and who came to thinkof <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> as a son . 
And <PERSON>Sharon Paul</PERSON> , a former elementary schoolteacher who as acollege student started a pen-pal friendship with <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> and who eventuallyfell in love with him.Each came to believe in <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's innocence . 
And each worked hard to help himprove his case . 
Between them , <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> made more than a dozen tripsto <PERSON>Grundy</PERSON> , the coal-mining town in southwest <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> where the murder tookplace , interviewing dozens of people . 
They concluded that <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> had beenframed by police and prosecutors , defended by incompetent lawyers and condemnedto death by a small-town jury bent upon vengeance . 
They pushed for a new bloodtest of the evidence , and when the test implicated <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> as the killer , theysought to discredit their own expert . 
And they accused a local man of being the " real killer , " a claim they stuck with even after they learned of informationindicating he had the wrong blood type.When their efforts to get a stay of execution failed , they conducted ahigh-profile media campaign to compel then-Gov . 
<PERSON>L. Douglas Wilder</PERSON> to commute , orat least delay , the sentence . 
In the weeks before <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> was put to death , hispicture was on the cover of <ORGANIZATION>Time magazine</ORGANIZATION> ( " This Man Might Be Innocent . 
This ManIs Due to Die " ) . 
He was interviewed from death row on " Larry King Live , " the " Today " show , " Primetime Live , " " Good Morning America " and " The <PERSON>Phil DonahueShow</PERSON> . 
" Opponents of the death penalty also seized on the case , staging vigils outsidethe governor 's mansion in <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Greensville Correctional Center</ORGANIZATION> , where the execution was due to take place . 
Pope <PERSON>John Paul II</PERSON> made a public pleafor mercy , and Mother Teresa personally phoned the governor 's chief counsel.What started out as a shocking crime in a remote corner of <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> became aninternational cause celebre . 
" The anti-death penalty movement has never had much in the way of sympatheticvisuals or symbols , " says <PERSON>Richard Dieter</PERSON> , executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>DeathPenalty Information Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . 
" Other movements have trees andwhales , positive images . 
Well , an innocent person is a positive image . 
" Back in <LOCATION>Grundy</LOCATION> , a scrappy community of 1,500 in the heart of <LOCATION>Appalachia</LOCATION> , manypeople were appalled . 
They viewed <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's supporters as a powerful group oflawyers , activists and journalists who were blinded by their loathing of thedeath penalty and taken in by a clever psychopath . 
" They were trying to buildthis case for <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> 's innocence , and they did n't care who they threw to thedogs , " says <PERSON>Pat Hatfield</PERSON> , the victim of an earlier incident , in which <ORGANIZATION>Colemanhad</ORGANIZATION> exposed himself and masturbated in front of her at the public library . 
" Itdid n't matter whose life was destroyed as long as they could save <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> . 
" Two years after <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's execution , <ORGANIZATION>Arnold & Porter</ORGANIZATION> paid a substantial sum tosettle a libel claim by the man it had identified as the " real killer . " 
Afterthat , <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> and the firm stopped commenting publicly on the case . 
They declinedto discuss it for this article , except for a brief statement issued by the firm : " We complied with our professional responsibility and stand by ourrepresentation of <PERSON>Roger Coleman</PERSON> . 
" <PERSON>Jim McCloskey</PERSON> has taken a much different approach . 
Within hours of the DNA testresults in <DATE>January</DATE> , he told a press conference that he was wrong and that RogerColeman had betrayed his trust . 
Like a patient determined to take his medicine , he answered every question , proclaimed the DNA result a victory for the truth -- " even though this particular truth feels like a kick in the stomach . " 
And hespent hours with a reporter going over the case , sifting the clues , acknowledging errors of judgment.He concedes that someone looking in from the outside , with the benefit ofhindsight , would ask : " How in the hell did <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> ever believe that Colemanwas innocent , given what we know today ? " 
" I keep asking myself : Where did I go wrong ? 
What did I miss ? " 
And so he beginsto go over it all again , starting with the night nearly 25 years ago when ayoung woman was brutally raped and murdered.THEY WERE HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS , <PERSON>Brad McCoy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wanda Faye Thompson</PERSON> , marriedafter his graduation from <ORGANIZATION>Grundy Senior High</ORGANIZATION> in <DATE>1978</DATE> , when he was 18 and she was16 . 
He got a job as a <ORGANIZATION>United Coal</ORGANIZATION> parts clerk , while she dropped out of schooland stayed at home . 
<PERSON>Brad</PERSON> says his wife " was a good-hearted person . 
Just veryquiet , considerate of others . " 
They rented a small house amid <PERSON>Grundy</PERSON> 's hills andhollows , across Slate Creek from the main highway.On the night of <DATE>March 10 , 1981</DATE> , <PERSON>Brad</PERSON> came home from the swing shift shortlyafter 11 to find <PERSON>Wanda</PERSON> 's body on the bedroom floor in a pool of warm blood . 
Shehad been stabbed twice in the chest , and her throat had been slashed with suchforce that she was nearly decapitated . 
She was 19 years old.Investigators quickly focused on <PERSON>Roger Coleman</PERSON> , 22 , a bright but troubled youngman who was married to <PERSON>Wanda</PERSON> 's 16-year-old sister and worked at the TJ&M CoalCo . 
mine up on <ORGANIZATION>Looney</ORGANIZATION> 's <LOCATION>Creek</LOCATION> . 
Raised mostly by his grandparents and his uncleafter his parents separated , <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> first got in trouble with the authoritiesfor making obscene phone calls as a teenager . 
Just before graduating from highschool in <DATE>1977</DATE> , he was accused of attempting to rape a local schoolteacher . 
Shetestified that he gained entry to her home , forced her to tie up her terrified6-year-old daughter and threatened her with a gun before she was able to escape.He denied the charge , and his high school principal testified that he had seenColeman at school at the time of the crime . 
But the jury believed the victim -- <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> served 20 months in prison . 
Then , two months before the murder , therewas the library incident . 
All of that , plus <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's family ties to <LOCATION>Wanda</LOCATION> , ledpolice to his door.At first , <PERSON>Brad McCoy</PERSON> did n't believe it . 
He had played sandlot baseball with hisbrother-in-law and believed <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> had been wrongly accused in the rape case . 
Andthere was no bad blood between <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wanda</PERSON> -- she had doted on her littlesister and treated <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> like family . 
Roger had even served as a pallbearer ather funeral . 
But police said the evidence was persuasive , and <PERSON>Brad</PERSON> quickly cameto accept that <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> was a cold-blooded killer.The trial opened on <DATE>March 15 , 1982</DATE> . 
At a gas station next to the courthouse , someone posted a sign " Time to Bring Back the Hanging Tree . " 
The defense team -- two local lawyers , neither of whom had ever tried a major criminal case -- asked for a change of venue . 
But presiding Judge <PERSON>Nicholas Persin</PERSON> ruled Colemancould get a fair trial in Grundy.The prosecution 's case was built upon circumstantial evidence -- there were nowitnesses to the crime . 
<PERSON>Brad McCoy</PERSON> testified that <PERSON>Wanda</PERSON> was a timid and anxiousperson who would have opened her front door at night only to a man she knew andtrusted , such as her brother-in-law . 
The prosecution 's forensics expert saidthree small spots of blood on <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's dungarees matched <PERSON>Wanda</PERSON> 's blood type , and that two pubic hairs found on her body had similar characteristics to his.The state 's serologist said the rapist 's semen contained traces of type B blood -- the same as <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's and <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of the male population . 
The pantsColeman handed over to investigators the day after the murder were wet on thebottom 10 inches of each leg . 
Prosecutors theorized that <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> had parked hispickup truck across Slate Creek from the McCoy house , committed the deed andthen fled across the shallow stream to avoid being seen by neighbors . 
And theyheard from a cellmate , who said <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> had confessed the crime to him.Coleman claimed he had an alibi for the time of the murder . 
After learning thathis evening shift had been canceled , he had stopped to shoot the breeze with hisgood friend <PERSON>Phillip VanDyke</PERSON> , then had gone to a nearby trailer park to pick upan eight-track Supertramp tape he had left at <LOCATION>Sandra</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Scott Stiltner</PERSON> 's place.After that , he said , he went to a public bathhouse in town to shower , as minerscustomarily did , and change into clean clothes . 
There simply was n't time , heinsisted , for him to have pulled up near <LOCATION>Slate Creek</LOCATION> , made his way to WandaMcCoy 's house , and raped and killed her before <PERSON>Brad McCoy</PERSON> got home . 
VanDykecorroborated his story , saying the two men parted company at about 10:30 . 
ButSandra Stiltner testified that <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> had come and gone from her place at about10 :20 , leaving a 45-minute window -- just long enough for a rapist-killer in ahurry , according to the prosecution . 
" Bear in mind rapists are women haters , not women lovers , " says <PERSON>Thomas Scott</PERSON> , one of the prosecutors . 
" He did n't go there to engage in foreplay ; he went thereto kill her . 
It could have easily occurred in 10 minutes or less . 
" The trial started on a <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>morning</TIME> and ended on a <DATE>Thursday</DATE> <TIME>afternoon</TIME> . 
Thejurors took 3 hours 30 minutes that evening to find <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> guilty . 
The nextday , they decided on the death penalty.Judge <PERSON>Persin</PERSON> had never sentenced a man to die before . 
" I hated it , " he recalls . 
" I knew what I had to do , and it bothered me so much I hardly slept that night . 
" But given the evidence and <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's history , the judge says , he believes theverdict and the penalty were correct.At his sentencing hearing , <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> told the court he did n't much care whether helived or died . 
His wife had filed for divorce . 
" Last night when the verdict ofguilty came back , I lost the only thing that ever meant anything to me , myfreedom , my life and my wife , whom I love very much . 
At this point , the deathpenalty or life , it does n't matter . 
It 's up to the Lord now , anyway . 
" Once he got to death row , however , <PERSON>Roger Coleman</PERSON> changed his mind.SITTING AT THE KITCHEN TABLE in her small <LOCATION>Charlottesville</LOCATION> townhouse , <PERSON>Marie Deanssmiles</PERSON> softly , recalling the first time she met <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> on death row . 
" He wasreally feeling sorry for himself . 
You know : ' My life was good , and everythingwas fine , and now I 'm in this situation . ' " 
He told her he was consideringdropping his appeal . 
She listened for a while before losing patience . 
" Look , <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> , " she recalls telling him . 
" If you 're really innocent , I 'd think you wouldwant to get out of here rather than be executed . " 
" He just sat there for a few minutes , and then he got this little grin on hisface , and he said , ' Okay , I want to work with you . ' 
" Deans became involved in prison reform after her mother-in-law was murdered in1972 by an escaped convict . 
She and her grieving husband asked themselves why somany people came out of prison even more violent and antisocial than when theywent in . 
The couple started doing volunteer work with inmates , and , when shemoved from her native <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> in early <DATE>1983</DATE> , she opened theVirginia Coalition of Jails and Prisons . 
She quickly discovered that the state ' sdeath row inmates were among the most neglected , and she began counseling them.She hooked them up with lawyers and made sure they filed their appeals . 
Shebecame fiercely dedicated to one goal : keeping them alive.From the start , <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> intrigued her . 
" He was very bright ; he read all the time -- science books and science fiction were his favorites . " 
They talked once aweek on the phone , and she saw him every six weeks or so when she visited therow . 
She grew to hold him in such high regard that she put him on the board ofher organization.For Deans , <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's guilt or innocence was n't primary . 
She worked with plentyof men she knew were guilty . 
But he was different : quiet , brainy , direct . 
Hetold her about his dreams , including one in which he was strapped to theelectric chair and she was holding him by his toe , pulling him away from death.Deans never bought most of the pathetic " I was framed " stories she heard frominmates . 
But she came to believe that <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> was either innocent or had nomemory of committing the murder . 
" I have worked with psychopaths , and they ' resort of obvious , " says <PERSON>Deans</PERSON> . 
" They 're unable to be in touch with their ownconsciences , but they are able to be in touch with what moves you and to feedyou that . " 
Roger , she says , was never smooth or slick , never seemed to beperforming for her benefit . 
" I just did not get the sense that he thought hecould pull the wool over my eyes , or that he was trying to . 
" He made a similar impression on <PERSON>Sharon Paul</PERSON> , a <ORGANIZATION>University of Virginia</ORGANIZATION> sophomorewho responded to his ad in a student newspaper : " Thirteen steps from eternity.Death Row prisoner seeks sincere people to correspond with and for possiblevisits . " 
He described himself and asked for photos , but added : " Sincerity iswhat counts . " 
" I was captured by the vulnerability : ' Here 's me , and all I want is someone towrite to me , ' " <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> recalls . 
" It was letting the world see his loneliness . 
Iguess I admired that honesty and openness from the very start . 
" She wrote to him , and within days he wrote back , describing his life in <LOCATION>Grundyand</LOCATION> on death row . 
He offered to answer any questions she had about the crime . 
" For what it 's worth , I did n't do it , " he told her.He was charming and solicitous . 
He insisted on buying her gifts , even though hehad little money . 
He sent her clippings from mail-order catalogues , asked her tosend back multiple selections to ensure he chose something she liked that wouldstill be a surprise . 
He made her cassette tapes of love songs he recorded offthe radio . 
She recalls that he was devastated by the <DATE>1986</DATE> Challenger explosion.If they ever had a daughter , he wanted to name her after <PERSON>Christa McAuliffe</PERSON> , theteacher who died during the disaster.They seldom talked of the future . 
" I was in denial of the possibility ofanything other than his release , " says <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> . 
" <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> , on the other hand , was muchmore realistic . 
He called himself an optimistic pessimist -- he hoped for thebest but expected the worst . 
" <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> needed a new lawyer to launch his appeal , and <PERSON>Deans</PERSON> hooked him up <ORGANIZATION>withArnold & Porter</ORGANIZATION> , which takes great pride in doing pro bono work . 
The firm ' slawyers filed a writ of habeas corpus -- a standard legal tool of prisonersseeking judicial review . 
When they lost in circuit court , the lawyers went tothe <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> , which rejected their appeal on the grounds that itwas filed one day late . 
The <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> upheld the rejection by 6 to 3 . 
" This is a case about federalism , " wrote Justice <PERSON>Sandra Day O'Connor</PERSON> for themajority , seemingly more concerned about state court prerogatives than the factthat <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's life was at stake.The ruling became a rallying cry for opponents of capital punishment who saw itas a part of a campaign by the justices to streamline the appeals process anddeliver condemned prisoners to the executioner more swiftly . 
But to cheat theelectric chair , <PERSON>Roger Coleman</PERSON> needed to be more than just a cause . 
He needed newevidence -- and someone dedicated to finding it.THE BACK WALL OF <PERSON>JIM MCCLOSKEY</PERSON> 'S OFFICE IS HIS RÉSUMÉ . 
It holds a remarkablecollection of photographs of the three dozen innocent people he has helped freefrom prison , most of them taken at the moment they emerged from behind bars.Some of the faces are grim and frozen , as if all of the anger from years ofincarceration has taken command of their features and wo n't let go . 
Others arelocked in wide loopy smiles with glazed eyes that betray their amazement . 
Andthere in almost every photo , eyes glistening , is McCloskey.He grew up outside <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> , graduated from <ORGANIZATION>Bucknell University</ORGANIZATION> , joined theNavy , then became a management consultant . 
A lifelong bachelor , he woke up oneday in <DATE>1979</DATE> at age 37 , looked closely at himself and did n't much care for whathe saw . 
" My life was like a rainbow -- it might have looked pretty , but it wasvapor , " <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> recalls . 
" I wanted to lead what I felt to be an authenticlife . 
I wanted to get to the real stuff of the world . 
" He quit his job , entered a theological seminary in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> and made plans tobecome a minister . 
Then , in his second year , he began doing field work as astudent chaplain at <ORGANIZATION>Trenton State Prison</ORGANIZATION> . 
There he met an inmate named Jorge " Chiefie " de los Santos , who was serving life for a murder he claimed he had notcommitted . 
De los Santos was so adamant that <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> agreed to read the trialtranscript . 
He found that de los Santos 's conviction had hinged largely on analleged confession he made to a fellow inmate . 
McCloskey tracked down the inmateand got him to admit he had lied . 
In the <DATE>summer of 1983</DATE> , de los Santos won hisfreedom , and <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> found his calling . 
" I felt this is what God has ordainedfor me to do , " he says . 
" Chiefie would say I saved his life . 
But he saved mine . 
" Centurion Ministries started out as a one-man shop that <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> operated fromhis living room . 
It now boasts five full-time and four part-time employees , anda <MONEY>$ 1 million</MONEY> annual budget , financed by foundations and private donors . 
From thestart , innocence was the watchword . 
McCloskey was n't interested in whethersomeone got a fair trial -- he says plenty of guilty defendants get a lessthan perfect one . 
" Innocence came to me -- I did n't go seeking it . 
And being alay person , not a lawyer , that 's all I was interested in . 
" He was shocked to discover that some police and prosecutors routinely lied orcut corners to make their cases . 
" I 've come to see the criminal justice systemas fraught with flaws and frailties . 
" Yet he sometimes engages in his own sleight of hand , wearing a priest 's collarin the field , knowing that it helps get people to talk . 
" I 'm a graduate of thePrinceton Theological Seminary , but I 'm not an ordained person . 
I introducemyself as <PERSON>Jim McCloskey</PERSON> , not as Reverend or Father , " he says.McCloskey and his team have never lacked for work . 
Their list of successesincludes <PERSON>Clarence Brandley</PERSON> , freed after 10 years on death row in <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> formurder after <ORGANIZATION>Centurion</ORGANIZATION> found an eyewitness who identified the real killers ; <PERSON>David Milgaard</PERSON> , who spent 23 years in a Canadian prison for murder and rapeuntil DNA testing confirmed his innocence ; and <PERSON>Clarence Chance</PERSON> and <PERSON>Benny Powell</PERSON> , imprisoned for more than 17 years for the murder of a <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> deputy sheriffuntil Centurion proved that investigators had coerced witnesses into falsetestimony . 
Not every case has been a triumph . 
<PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> reckons that four of theinmates his group has worked for turned out to have been guilty . 
In two of thosecases , DNA testing proved the prisoners ' guilt . 
In the other two , the prisoners ' accounts unraveled when <ORGANIZATION>McCloskey</ORGANIZATION> re-interviewed witnesses . 
He immediatelydropped each case , even if he had worked on it for several years.When <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> contacted Centurion in <DATE>1987</DATE> , <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> read the trial transcript , then spent three hours talking to <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> . 
" We went through everything : what hedid that night and why , who he encountered . " 
He told <ORGANIZATION>McCloskey</ORGANIZATION> about The ChoiceIs Yours , a program that <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> had organized with help from the CatholicDiocese of <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> in which he lectured potential young offenders about theprice of crime and the miseries of prison . 
" He was very calm , collected , rational , did n't come off as slick at all . 
Hewas n't a salesman . 
He did n't try to persuade me . 
But he answered whateverquestions I had . " 
McCloskey was impressed , and he trusted his instincts . 
" Iwalked away believing he was not the kind of person who would commit such abrutal murder . 
" McCloskey drove straight from the prison to <LOCATION>Grundy</LOCATION> , where he spent nearly amonth investigating the case . 
He persuaded Judge <PERSON>Persin</PERSON> to let him examine theevidence file . 
He interviewed those who had seen <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> that night , and hereenacted the timeline.He discovered that the jury had never heard about <PERSON>Phillip VanDyke</PERSON> 's timecard , which he punched at 10:41 on the night of the murder -- just minutes , VanDykesaid , after he had finished chatting with <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> . 
He noted that the Stiltnershad originally told investigators that <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> had visited sometime between 10and <TIME>10:30 that night</TIME> . 
Only when <PERSON>Sandra Stiltner</PERSON> testified in court did she nailthe time as exactly 10:20 . 
McCloskey believed VanDyke and his timecard ratherthan <PERSON>Stiltner</PERSON> 's testimony . 
And there were other nagging details : Why did WandaMcCoy have dirt on her hands and arms ? 
What about the medical examiner ' sconclusion that she had been sodomized as well as raped , a fact the jury neverheard ? 
How could one attacker have committed both acts within the space of a fewminutes?In <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> 's view , the police had jumped on the first plausible suspect , ignoring other possibilities . 
" A crime of this nature is very rare , and it justinflames the passions and prejudices of everybody in a community . 
And that wasmy view of what happened with <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> : They shoehorned him into this conviction . 
" On his way back to <LOCATION>Princeton</LOCATION> , <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to see <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> ' slawyers at <ORGANIZATION>Arnold & Porter</ORGANIZATION> . 
The easiest way to prove <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's innocence , hetold them , was to have the blood and sperm samples from the victim re-testedusing newly developed DNA techniques . 
But the lawyers were not interested . 
Theysaid the judge was unlikely to order a test and , in any event , samples that hadbeen lying around in an unprotected evidence box for eight years were unlikelyto yield a definitive result . 
But the real surprise was that <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> himself wasnot interested in DNA testing . 
He told <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> that after his arrest he hadhad sex in jail with a female guard , and he feared the authorities had plantedhis semen from that encounter as evidence . 
McCloskey dismissed <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's fearsas classic jailhouse paranoia , " but I also felt a certain amount of discomfortin my mind as to why he was n't eager for DNA testing . 
" Enough discomfort that <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> says he dropped out of the <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> case fornearly a year and concentrated on other , more promising clients . 
Then in <DATE>1990</DATE> , he found a reason to get back into it.TALL , SLIM AND DEEPLY EARNEST , <PERSON>Kathleen Behan</PERSON> , came to <ORGANIZATION>Arnold & Porter</ORGANIZATION> in July1990 as a 28-year-old legal associate with an abiding hostility toward the deathpenalty . 
One of the first cases she was handed was <PERSON>Roger Coleman</PERSON> 's appeal.She went down to <ORGANIZATION>Mecklenburg Correctional Center</ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> to meether client and was struck by <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's sincerity and mastery of the details ofhis case . 
Then she met with <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> , who was immediately impressed with her . 
" She was the kind of lawyer I love to work with -- as much fact-driven aslaw-driven , " he recalls . 
" She realized pretty fast that if <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was going to befreed we needed to develop new evidence . 
" <PERSON>Kitty Behan</PERSON> reversed the firm 's previous position and agreed to DNA testing.Judge Persin consented to having the evidence shipped to <ORGANIZATION>Edward Blake ofForensic Science Associates</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> , one of the pioneers in the newlydeveloping field.Coleman 's legal team got another potential break after <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> placed an ad in theVirginia Mountaineer newspaper seeking new leads in the case . 
On the day it ran , <ORGANIZATION>Arnold & Porter</ORGANIZATION> fielded a phone call from <PERSON>Teresa Horn</PERSON> , a 22-year-old woman whoclaimed that an unemployed miner named <PERSON>Bobby Donnie Ramey</PERSON> had attempted tosexually assault her one night in <DATE>1987</DATE> at a friend 's house . 
When she resisted , she said , <PERSON>Ramey</PERSON> warned her that he would do to her the same thing he had " doneto that woman on <ORGANIZATION>Slate Creek</ORGANIZATION> . 
" <PERSON>Ramey</PERSON> and his family lived just 50 yards uphill from <PERSON>Wanda McCoy</PERSON> 's house . 
Overthe years <PERSON>Ramey</PERSON> , a high school dropout , had had a number of scrapes with thelaw , ranging from fishing without a license to assaulting a police officer . 
Hisnickname was " Trouble . 
" But the DNA result that came back in <DATE>November 1990</DATE> was far from helpful to thedefense . 
<PERSON>Blake</PERSON> had had to work from an extremely limited sample -- the cottonswab of semen from the victim had disappeared from the evidence bag , and he wasforced to scrape DNA samples from the stick it had been attached to.Nonetheless , he found enough to determine there were two sets of sperm in thevictim . 
One presumably came from <PERSON>Brad McCoy</PERSON> , who testified he had had sex withhis wife two nights before the murder . 
Blake narrowed down the other toapproximately <PERCENT>2 percent</PERCENT> of the population , including <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> . 
The state ofVirginia 's experts would later argue that the proportion of men who had bothtype B blood and the DNA match was even narrower -- 0.2 percent.McCloskey remembers exactly where he was when he heard the news : at a pay phonein <LOCATION>Lancaster</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION> , where he was working on another case . 
" My first thought was , ' Son of a bitch , the guy did it . ' 
" But <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> was undaunted . 
She found other experts who claimed that the mixedsperm sample made an accurate DNA reading impossible , and who also challengedthe studies on which the percentages were based . 
And she and <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> seized onanother possibility -- that the second sample of sperm came not from BradMcCoy but from a second rapist . 
Since even the police accepted that <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> wasalone that night , the two-attackers thesis , if proved , could have exoneratedhim . 
McCloskey put his doubts aside , and he and <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> went back to work.Blake says that this was the moment when <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's defenders lost their ethicalbearings . 
Fixated on <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's innocence , they ignored or discredited evidencethat pointed to his guilt : " Somewhere along the way these people who weresupposed to be in the fact-finding business abandoned their responsibility tofacts and truth , and started operating on belief . 
" <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> insists he went where the facts led him . 
And , by late <DATE>1990</DATE> , the factswere leading him to <PERSON>Donnie Ramey</PERSON> 's door.MCCLOSKEY TAKES A FADING <ORGANIZATION>POLAROID</ORGANIZATION> FROM A STACK : " This is <LOCATION>Wanda</LOCATION> 's house , and thisis the <PERSON>Ramey</PERSON> home . 
There 's a perfect way to get down the hill , kill her and getback up without being seen . 
" <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> eventually found three other women who claimed to have beenattacked by <PERSON>Donnie Ramey</PERSON> . 
Horn and two of the women gave affidavits . 
The dayafter Horn gave an interview to a <LOCATION>Roanoke</LOCATION> television station repeating herallegations , she died of a drug overdose . 
Police found no evidence of foul play , but <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> was suspicious . 
" I interviewed each of these women , I was with them in their living rooms , I sawhow frightened they were , " he says.McCloskey and <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> also interviewed <PERSON>Keester Shortridge</PERSON> , a neighbor of <ORGANIZATION>Ramey</ORGANIZATION> 's , who claimed he had found a plastic bag containing clothes and bloody sheets inthe back of his pickup truck on the day after the murder . 
<PERSON>Shortridge</PERSON> said he haddumped the bag in a ravine after police expressed no interest in examining thecontents . 
Behan even rented a backhoe to dig up the evidence from the spot . 
Allshe found was a small patch of dirty sheet whose contents were too degraded tobe analyzed . 
Nonetheless , in <DATE>October 1991</DATE> , <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> filed a petition with JudgePersin citing newly discovered evidence suggesting that <PERSON>Ramey</PERSON> was <PERSON>Wanda McCoy</PERSON> ' skiller . 
In its response , the state attorney general 's office poked holes inBehan 's claim . 
Miners are required to provide their blood type in case ofaccident , and <PERSON>Ramey</PERSON> 's employment card identified his as type A , whereas WandaMcCoy 's rapist 's was type B. Also , <PERSON>Teresa Horn</PERSON> was a known drug user who had hada child out of wedlock and was n't sure who the father was . 
Neither she norRamey 's other purported victims had ever filed charges nor told the police oftheir suspicions . 
" I had serious problems with that woman 's credibility , " says <PERSON>Tommy Scott</PERSON> , theformer prosecutor . 
" But <ORGANIZATION>Arnold & Porter</ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON>Jim McCloskey</PERSON> and the national mediabought into it hook , line and sinker . 
" While <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> was lining up <PERSON>Donnie Ramey</PERSON> 's alleged victims , he did notinterview <PERSON>Roger Coleman</PERSON> 's surviving victims . 
<PERSON>Brenda Ratliff</PERSON> , the schoolteacherwho had accused <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> of attempted rape in <DATE>1977</DATE> , refused to talk to him . 
Andhe did not attempt to speak with the two librarians who had been confronted byColeman in <DATE>January 1981</DATE> , two months before the murder . 
By the time he heardabout them , he says , he was so immersed in a last-gasp search for new evidenceof <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's innocence that he did n't have time . 
And because <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> was n'tcharged with the library incident until after his murder arrest , McCloskeyassumed the librarians had n't identified him until police told them he was asuspected killer ; he decided their testimony was unreliable.Had he talked to <PERSON>Pat Hatfield</PERSON> , the chief librarian , he might have concludeddifferently.Hatfield and <PERSON>Jean Gilbert</PERSON> were about to close up on a stormy <DATE>Monday</DATE> <TIME>evening</TIME> whena young man in a navy blue jacket and dark pants came through the front door . 
" He had his pants unzipped , and he was masturbating , " <PERSON>Hatfield</PERSON> recalls . 
" He gotall the way up to about five feet from the front desk . 
By then , I had actuallylooked at him in the face . 
And that 's what really scared me because he had thisdead look in his eyes . 
A cold dead stare . 
Never blinked . 
And then he ejaculatedon the floor and on the desk . 
He never said one word to me . . . But what I sawin his eyes , it was so scary . 
It was like a dead soul . 
" The man ran out the door , and <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON> called the police . 
At an investigator ' ssuggestion , <PERSON>Hatfield</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gilbert</PERSON> pored through old high school yearbooks , andwithin days they had each identified <PERSON>Roger Coleman</PERSON> . 
But police persuaded themnot to file charges . 
" I told them it was a pretty serious case , but they told meit 's not a big deal , and at the most he 'd get a <MONEY>$ 30</MONEY> fine . 
And I knew better , butI let them talk me into it . 
" Two months later she got a phone call from her mother , " She said , ' Pat , there ' sbeen a girl murdered , and it 's <PERSON>Roger Coleman</PERSON> 's sister-in-law . ' 
And I tell you , Ithink the blood just left my body because I knew , I knew then . 
" Hatfield takes out a letter . 
It 's a firm but polite note from <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> , writtenfrom death row <DATE>six years later</DATE> . 
He writes that he 's tired of being accused ofthe library incident . 
He 's got an alibi for that evening , and he accuses anotherlocal man who supposedly looks like him . 
He signs off , " Sincerely , RogerColeman . " 
What <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> did n't know is that <PERSON>Pat Hatfield</PERSON> had tutored the otherman in high school and knew it was n't him . 
" Just an outrageous lie , " she says.In <DATE>December 1991</DATE> , Judge <PERSON>Persin</PERSON> dismissed <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> 's petition implicating <PERSON>Ramey</PERSON> . 
Twomonths later , he set <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's execution date for <DATE>May 20</DATE> . 
" IS IT DIFFICULT TO BE OPTIMISTIC ? " 
<PERSON>Bryant Gumbel</PERSON> asked <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> on the " Today " show , 15 days before the execution date.With six days to go , <PERSON>Larry King</PERSON> wanted to know : " How do you feel ? 
Are youbitter ? 
Angry ? 
" Five days later , <PERSON>Phil Donahue</PERSON> went straight to the point : " Wow . 
You 've 30 hoursleft to live . 
" Having failed in the legal process , <PERSON>Jim McCloskey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kitty Behan</PERSON> turned to thecourt of public opinion . 
They sent out press kits to dozens of publications , eliciting a parade of newspaper and magazine stories that tended to portrayColeman as an innocent victim and the citizens of <LOCATION>Grundy</LOCATION> as hillbillies runamok.In a piece headlined " Hung on a Technicality , " <ORGANIZATION>Newsweek</ORGANIZATION> portrayed a " small , sooted town " from which had " spun the kind of twisted tale that gives SouthernGothic a good name . " 
As for the original trial , " the courthouse should have hada big top . " 
The Washington Post reported that the crime had " whipped thisAppalachian town of 1,500 into a frenzy of hatred and suspicion , " and quotedColeman 's claim that " every minute of my time that night was accounted for . " 
TheLos <ORGANIZATION>Angeles Times</ORGANIZATION> reported that " startling new evidence has emerged " in the formof the <PERSON>Ramey</PERSON> allegation and <PERSON>Teresa Horn</PERSON> 's untimely death , but neglected tomention <PERSON>Blake</PERSON> 's DNA test implicating Coleman.Then came the television cameras . 
Coleman made excellent , even mesmerizing TV , as he patiently explained the timeline and the witness statements , analyzed theDNA evidence and coolly dissected his own emotions . 
" There 's a lot of anger , " he told <PERSON>Larry King</PERSON> . 
" There 's a lot of bitterness , anda lot of frustration . " 
During his first years of incarceration , he said , " I hada tremendous amount of hate , and it was consuming me . 
I had to deal with it , andI did a pretty good job of getting a handle on it . . . But now I 'm six daysaway from being executed , and those feelings are back , and they 're multiplied bya factor of 10 . 
" <PERSON>Tom Scott</PERSON> and fellow prosecutor <PERSON>Michael McGlothlin</PERSON> , <PERSON>Pat Hatfield</PERSON> , <PERSON>Jean Gilbert</PERSON> , <PERSON>Brad McCoy</PERSON> and <PERSON>Brenda Ratliff</PERSON> , the woman whom <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> had attempted to rape in1977 , all journeyed to <LOCATION>Richmond</LOCATION> to support <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's execution . 
" We tried to setthe story straight , but no one ever really listened to us , " <PERSON>McCoy</PERSON> recalls . 
Themedia had decided that <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> was the victim . 
" No one ever really understoodthat <PERSON>Wanda</PERSON> was the real victim . 
" McCoy even consented to appear on " Today " to confront his former brother-in-law . 
Asked by <PERSON>Bryant Gumbel</PERSON> if he had anything to say to <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> , <PERSON>Brad</PERSON> replied : " Yes , I would like to ask him why he did it , and I would also like to ask him to admitit . 
" <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> for once seemed to lose his cool . 
" I did not kill <LOCATION>Wanda</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Brad !</PERSON> 
I did n'thave anything to do with it ! 
And if you 'd open your eyes and look at theevidence we have now , evidence that the state has withheld . . . I mean , youjust listened to what they 've said , and you bought their theory , and you justclosed your mind to everything that we 've uncovered . 
" <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> and her associates at <ORGANIZATION>Arnold & Porter</ORGANIZATION> wrote to dozens of celebritiesseeking their support , and the firm issued press statements claiming to haveuncovered " the real killer . " 
One release claimed " the murderer still lives inGrundy and has continued attacking women ever since . 
" <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> , who was battling the disease lupus at the same time she was struggling tosave <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's life , felt crushed by an enormous sense of responsibility . 
" I ' mthe only person that stands between <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> and the electric chair , " she latertold author <PERSON>John C. Tucker</PERSON> . 
" And , you know , I 'm a pathetic substitute forSuperman , which is the only person who can save this guy . 
" <PERSON>Marie Deans</PERSON> says she was uncomfortable with the defense team 's strategy . 
Sherecalls participating alongside <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> at a media briefing in which hepointed the finger at <ORGANIZATION>Ramey</ORGANIZATION> . 
" <PERSON>Jim</PERSON> said some things that were just shocking tome , because we did n't have any proof , " she says.If the media were convinced , the courts were not . 
" After a review of the alleged ' new evidence , ' " declared a federal judge in dismissing <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's final appealeight days before the execution date , " this court finds the case against Colemanas strong or stronger than the evidence adduced at trial . 
" <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> and <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> made a last-ditch effort to persuade Gov. Wilder tointervene . 
The governor 's office received more than 6,000 messages , 95 percentof which favored <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> . 
McCloskey and <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> were elated when <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> put Colemanon the cover , figuring the governor would have no choice but to delay theexecution . 
But <PERSON>Wilder</PERSON> , a proud and prickly man who resented the pressure , was n'tabout to cave . 
Instead he offered <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> the chance to take a polygraph.The defense attorneys were outraged by the gesture . 
They believed it was unfairto compel a condemned man to take a test under such stressful circumstances . 
Butin the end they felt they had no choice . 
<PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> was helicoptered to statepolice headquarters on the morning of execution day . 
He emerged in manacles , hisarms lifted above his face to shade his eyes from the harsh sunlight , shufflingslowly through the door with armed state troopers on either side . 
None of hislawyers or friends was allowed to attend . 
Later in the day , Wilder 's officeannounced <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> had failed.That evening , <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> sat on the concrete floor next to <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> ' scell ; they were on one side of the bars , <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> on the other . 
For his lastmeal , he requested a Pizza Hut pizza , fudge cookies and Sprite . 
When it arrived , the pizza was cold and the Sprite warm . 
Still , <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> wolfed it down . 
" He showed no sign of fear , even anxiety , " <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> recalls . 
" It was surreal.Here we are sitting with a man we all know is about to die , and we 're talkingabout everyday life . 
We were all floating . 
" <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> told <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> he saw a positive side to his ordeal . 
" He said , ' If Ihad n't been wrongly convicted , I would be a nobody from <LOCATION>Grundy</LOCATION> for my entirelife . 
And here I am , I 've met <ORGANIZATION>Sharon</ORGANIZATION> , she means the world to me , I 'm famous , myface is on <ORGANIZATION>Time magazine</ORGANIZATION> . 
I 'm a somebody . ' 
" The guards said it was time to go . 
McCloskey met <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's eyes and solemnlypromised to prove his innocence . 
Then he and <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> left <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> with the deathrow chaplain . 
Neither <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> witnessed the execution.One of the journalists who did , <PERSON>Kathy Still</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Bristol</LOCATION> ( <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> ) <ORGANIZATION>Herald Courier</ORGANIZATION> , vividly recalls <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> entering the execution chamber . 
He was a few steps aheadof the chaplain and the guards , and he walked directly to the electric chair.Then he rapidly read his last words , which he had written on a paper towel , proclaiming his innocence and declaring his love for <ORGANIZATION>Sharon</ORGANIZATION> . 
" He held his headup the whole time , " Still recalls.AFTER THE EXECUTION , a devastated <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> spent a week at a religious retreat . 
" I reflected , and I grieved and came out of that with no answers at all . " 
Heeased the pain by plunging into other cases.Donnie <PERSON>Ramey</PERSON> filed a libel suit against <ORGANIZATION>Arnold & Porter</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> and Deans for <MONEY>$ 5million</MONEY> that the firm eventually settled for an undisclosed amount . 
But notbefore the defense lawyers deposed <PERSON>Ramey</PERSON> , who denied he had attacked any of thewomen who accused him of sexual misconduct . 
He also vehemently denied that hehad anything to do with <PERSON>Wanda McCoy</PERSON> 's murder and rape or that he had everclaimed otherwise . 
" We were n't saying he was a model citizen , " says <PERSON>Charles H. Smith III</PERSON> , <PERSON>Ramey</PERSON> ' sattorney . 
" But he was n't a rapist and a murderer . 
They had no justification forthe claim . 
" <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> , who argued that her accusations against <PERSON>Ramey</PERSON> were " well-founded andreasonable , " adamantly opposed the settlement . 
Still , she made partner at thefirm and became one of its most influential rainmakers . 
In <DATE>1998</DATE> , she madeWashingtonian magazine 's list of " Young Guns " -- top lawyers under 40 . 
The libel suit dried up funding for <PERSON>Marie Deans</PERSON> 's small organization , and shewas forced to close it down in <DATE>1993</DATE> . 
Inmates on <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's death row lost theirguardian angel . 
Deans says that before his execution <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> had elicited apromise that <ORGANIZATION>Arnold & Porter</ORGANIZATION> would donate funds to her group for the many hoursshe put in on his behalf . 
But when the time came , " I got a call from Kitty tosay they had decided to put that money somewhere else . 
" Looking back , <PERSON>Deans</PERSON> says she believes <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> did their best forColeman but should n't have accused <PERSON>Ramey</PERSON> without solid proof . 
" I do n't blameKitty . 
She was young and had never done one of these before , and she worked veryhard . 
But I did n't like the spin . 
I felt used , I guess . 
" For eight years , <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> did little to redeem his pledge to <PERSON>Roger Coleman</PERSON> . 
Itwas , he says , just too painful , and he was immersed in other work . 
But , with DNAtesting becoming more sophisticated , he decided it was time to seek a re-testingof the evidence . 
Then-Gov . 
Warner broke precedent by deciding to authorize thetest . 
" I believe we must always follow the available facts to a more completepicture of guilt or innocence , " he said in a statement.By then , most of the evidence in the <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> case had been lost or destroyed.But <PERSON>Edward Blake</PERSON> , the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> forensics expert , had adamantly refused toreturn to <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> authorities the DNA extract from his <DATE>1990</DATE> test -- less thana drop of fluid in a thimble-size microfuge tube . 
He agreed to provide thematerial to the <LOCATION>Toronto</LOCATION> crime lab.Many activists in the anti-death penalty movement enthusiastically embraced there-testing effort . 
Here was a chance for the Holy Grail : proof from a test tubethat an innocent person had been executed . 
But others , citing <PERSON>Blake</PERSON> 's earlierresults , were wary . 
" We already knew the odds were 49 out of 50 that he wasguilty , " says <PERSON>David Bruck</PERSON> , director of the <ORGANIZATION>Virginia Capital Case Clearinghouseat</ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Lee University</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I warned people to be cautious . 
" <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> was not unaware that a finding of innocence could strike a huge blowto the death penalty . 
But he says this was not his motive . 
" We 're part of nomovement except ourselves and those we serve . 
I believed in <PERSON>Roger Coleman</PERSON> , Imade a promise to <PERSON>Roger Coleman</PERSON> , spent our precious resources on him . 
I wantedthe truth to be known . 
" IT 'S TWO MONTHS AFTER THE FINDINGS WERE ANNOUNCED , and <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> has finallyremoved from his wall the framed <ORGANIZATION>Time</ORGANIZATION> cover of <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> in chains . 
Gone as wellis a sheet of drawing paper with the handwritten inscription : " This certificateis awarded to <PERSON>Jim McCloskey</PERSON> in recognition for being the best darn ivestigator [ sic ] in the whole US of A ! 
[ signed ] <PERSON>Roger K. Coleman</PERSON> , Chairman , SelectionCommittee . " 
" The last file boxes are going into storage , " says <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> . 
" We 've erased himfrom our Web site and our brochure . 
" Each of <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> 's closest supporters had expected the test results to exoneratehim , and each has had to deal with the news of his guilt . 
<PERSON>Marie Deans</PERSON> and SharonPaul say they do not feel betrayed . 
" I have to believe something , " says <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> , " and what I believe is , if <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> committed the crime , he had no memory of it , and that 's why he was able to be such a strong advocate for his own innocenceright until the end . 
" Still , the result has made her wonder about <PERSON>Jim McCloskey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Kitty Behan</PERSON> . 
" Ijust ca n't believe they were so wrong . 
I mean , these are people who do this fora living ; they 're not naive , they do n't get duped . 
And that <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> , this littleperson from southwest <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , could have fooled them for so long -- that ' sthe most difficult part for me to believe . 
" <PERSON>Behan</PERSON> has told friends that she still believes <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> was innocent and that shedoes n't accept the test findings . 
" This was a huge piece of <PERSON>Kitty Behan</PERSON> 's lifeand how she sees herself , " says author <PERSON>John C. Tucker</PERSON> , who wrote the <DATE>1997</DATE> bookMay God Have Mercy about the case . 
" It was not easy for anybody to find out thatyou were wrong . 
It 's easy to try and rationalize these results . 
" Unlike <PERSON>Paul and Deans</PERSON> , <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> does n't buy the theory that <PERSON>Coleman</PERSON> somehow haderased <PERSON>Wanda McCoy</PERSON> 's murder from his memory , but he 's not surprised that <PERSON>Colemanstuck</PERSON> to his claim of innocence even when sitting in the electric chair . 
" It wastoo late to tell the truth , " says <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> . 
" What would all those who were nearand dear to him think if he ever admitted that he did this ? 
He could n't allowthat to happen . 
So he had to go down to the end drowning in the lies . 
" <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> points to photos of the 24 inmates whom <ORGANIZATION>Centurion</ORGANIZATION> is currently workingto exonerate . 
At the top of the list is <PERSON>Walter Lomax</PERSON> , who has spent 38 years inMaryland 's prison system in the killing of a night manager during a Baltimoregrocery store robbery . 
There 's <PERSON>Barry Beach</PERSON> , locked away in a <LOCATION>Montana</LOCATION> prison for22 years in the killing of a young woman after police falsely claimed to haverecorded his confession . 
And <PERSON>Timothy Howard</PERSON> , sentenced to death in <DATE>1977</DATE> for bankrobbery and murder , and whom <PERSON>McCloskey</PERSON> recently helped win a verdict of " actualinnocence " from a <LOCATION>Columbus</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> , jury.This is his work , his life and his answer , finally , to the <PERSON>Roger Coleman</PERSON> case . 
" I do n't think I 'll ever put the pieces together . 
I 've tried , and I ca n't , andI 'm just moving on .
