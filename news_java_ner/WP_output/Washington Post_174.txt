<PERSON>Brittney Griner</PERSON> just led Baylor to a 40-0 record and a national championship.She 's an attractive woman with a quick smile , a well-spoken representative ofher university who is quick , in every interview , to deflect credit to herless-known - and less abused - teammates , and who will return for her senioryear in college rather than pursue a professional career.What a dreadful woman . 
Let 's all pile on.Griner did n't ask to be 6 feet 8 . 
She did n't ask for a low-pitched voice andsize 17 feet . 
Of course , those are perfectly good reasons for total strangers tospeculate about the gender of a 21-year-old college student.Shame on those who watched <PERSON>Griner</PERSON> play and whose sophisticated thought processesled them to that question . 
Shame on those who heard her voice and speculatedthat she might be a man , or had been a man , or might become a man . 
Shame onthose who have called her names and taunted her.I turned on WTEM-980 the other day and thought , " Who the heck is that squeakything ? " 
before realizing it was me , on " The Tony <PERSON>Kornheiser</PERSON> Show . " 
I 've alwayshad a high voice . 
Not a thing I can do about it.Mike <PERSON>Tyson</PERSON> also has always had a high voice . 
No one ever thought he was a woman , or suggested he had been a woman , or that he might become a woman . 
Nothing thathas been said about <PERSON>Tyson</PERSON> has been half as nasty as the <PERSON>Griner</PERSON> talk , despite thefact that he was convicted of rape , blew through <MONEY>millions of dollars</MONEY> , tattooedhalf his face , and who knows what else.But let a woman 's voice drop an octave and the gloves come off . 
Why does thatgive anyone the right to attack <PERSON>Griner</PERSON> ? 
This has always puzzled me . 
Why in theworld do people care so much about something that affects them so little ? 
Justcalm down.Of course we live in a country in which everyone is in everyone else 's business , thanks to social media . 
We 're just at a point in our history when toleranceseems to be at low tide . 
That 's not a great combination.Sports is supposed to be an escape from that , not just one more outlet for us touse to attack what we do n't understand and spew hate toward those who look orsound different than us.Every time I think we 're past this , finally , I am reminded that we still have along way to go in this country before we can just appreciate a talent likeGriner 's without looking for a way to explain it beyond her own God-givenabilities .
