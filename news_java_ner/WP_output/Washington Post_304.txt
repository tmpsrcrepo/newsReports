Regardless of what happens in the courtroom , <PERSON>Paula Jones</PERSON> 's sexual harassmentsuit against President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> has the Web in a whirl . 
Judging from a number ofpages on the Internet , most people believe <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> deserves her day in court.Little lavender ribbons , symbols of support for the Paula Jones Legal Fund , havepopped up in the unlikeliest places : The home page of <ORGANIZATION>Baseball Heaven</ORGANIZATION> , a rotisserie-league site , uses the ribbon topoint participants to <ORGANIZATION>Paula Jones</ORGANIZATION> 's legal expense fund.Robb <PERSON>T. Koether</PERSON> , a professor of mathematics and computer science atHampden-Sydney College , attached a lavender ribbon to one of his online mathassignments . 
" I think she deserves a chance to press her case , " <PERSON>Koether</PERSON> says from his officeon the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> college 's campus . 
" Even though <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> is president , heshould n't be allowed to duck this case until he 's out of office . 
" <PERSON>Mike Smith</PERSON> 's Politically Incorrect Sing-Along Page sports a pale purple loop.Smith is a <LOCATION>Manassas</LOCATION> resident who works for <ORGANIZATION>ORBCOMM</ORGANIZATION> , a Dulles-based satellitecompany . 
He 's also an aspiring satirist . 
To that end , he 's posted several songparodies penned for the occasion . 
The sharpest is sung to the tune of theBeatles ' " Ticket to Ride . 
" I think I 'm gon na be sad , I think it 's today , yeah , The girl that 's driving me mad , Ai n't going away.She wants a piece of my hide , She wants a piece of my hide , She wants a piece of my hide , and she do n't care.She said that meeting with me , had caused her distress , yeah , For she would never be free , until I confess.You get the drift . 
" I ca n't pass judgment on who said what , " says <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> . 
" Pretty much the samepeople who supported <ORGANIZATION>Anita Hill</ORGANIZATION> have turned their backs on <ORGANIZATION>Paula Jones</ORGANIZATION> . 
I do n'tthink <PERSON>Jones</PERSON> has been treated fairly . 
" <PERSON>Carolyn C. Gargaro</PERSON> agrees . 
A Web site designer for a New Jersey Internet serviceprovider , <PERSON>Gargaro</PERSON> dreamed up the " Support Paula Jones Lavender Ribbon Campaign " last <DATE>summer</DATE> . 
Her pages lead you to the official Paula Jones Legal Fund and toCamille <PERSON>Paglia</PERSON> 's pro-Jones rant in the <DATE>January</DATE> issue of Salon.Gargaro 's not the first to use a ribbon . 
More than 140 Web sites employ thecolor-coded symbols . 
Online , ribbons are used to show support of just abouteverything -- from awareness of prostate cancer , to keeping <PERSON>Hanson</PERSON> off of TV , toremembering victims of church bombings , to kicking nitwits off the Net.There 's even a " No More Ribbons Campaign Against Campaigns . " 
Such is theleveling effect of the Web.But for some reason , there is little balance in the <LOCATION>Paula Jones</LOCATION> affair . 
In fact , there 's a surprising paucity of support for <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> on the Internet . 
Theofficial <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> site lists his administration 's accomplishments , but makesno mention of the Jones suit . 
Jokes about <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> and Jones can be found allover the Internet . 
Washingtonpost.com , Court TV and other online publicationsmaintain files on the controversy.But visitors to the Web will mostly find Jones advocates and <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> detractors.Why is that ? 
Perhaps the Web really is living up to one of its promises , achance to lash out at big government and large media companies . 
" There 's noother place where you can voice your opinion so publicly , " <PERSON>Gargaro</PERSON> explains . 
" The Internet is a great place for the common person to reach a lot of people .
