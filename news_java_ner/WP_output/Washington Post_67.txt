<PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> was a liar , there 's no doubt about that now . 
He was also a cover-upartist . 
If the Freeh report is correct in its summary of the <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> childmolestation scandal , the public <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> of the last few years was a work offiction . 
In his place is a hubristic , indictable hypocrite.In the last interview before his death , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> insisted as strenuously as adying man could that he had absolutely no knowledge of a <DATE>1998</DATE> police inquiryinto child molestation accusations against his assistant coach , <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky.This</PERSON> has always been the critical point in assessing whether <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> and otherPenn State leaders enabled <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> 's crimes.If <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> knew about <DATE>' 98</DATE> , then he was n't some aging granddad who was deceived , but a canny and unfeeling power broker who put protecting his reputation aheadof protecting children.If he knew about <DATE>' 98</DATE> , then he understood the import of graduate assistant MikeMcQueary 's distraught account in <DATE>2001</DATE> that he witnessed <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> assaulting aboy in the <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> showers.If he knew about <DATE>' 98</DATE> , then he also perjured himself before a grand jury.Guilty.Paterno did n't always give lucid answers in his final interview conducted withThe <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post eight days before his death , but on this point he wascategorical and clear as a bell . 
He pled total , lying ignorance of the ' 98investigation into a local mother 's claim <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> had groped her son in theshower at the football building . 
How could <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> have no knowledge of this , Iasked him ? 
" Nobody knew , " he said.Everybody knew.Never heard a rumor ? 
" I never heard a thing , " he said.He heard everything . 
" If <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> 's guilty , nobody found out till after several incidents . 
" Not a whisper ? 
How is that possible?Paterno 's account of himself is flatly contradicted in damning detail by exFBI-director <PERSON>Louis Freeh</PERSON> 's report . 
In a news conference <DATE>Thursday</DATE> , <ORGANIZATION>Freeh</ORGANIZATION> chargedthat <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> , along with athletic director <PERSON>Timothy Curley</PERSON> , university presidentGraham <PERSON>Spanier</PERSON> and vice president <PERSON>Gary Schultz</PERSON> , engaged in a cover-up , " anactive agreement of concealment . 
" <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> was not only aware of the '98 investigation but followed it " closely " according to <ORGANIZATION>Freeh</ORGANIZATION> . 
As did the entire leadership of <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> . 
E-mails andconfidential notes by <PERSON>Schultz</PERSON> about the progress of the inquiry prove it . 
" Behavior - at best inappropriate @ worst sexual improprieties , " <PERSON>Schultz</PERSON> wrote . 
" At min - Poor Judgment . " 
<PERSON>Schultz</PERSON> also wrote , " Is this opening of pandora ' sbox ? " 
and " Other children ? 
" A <DATE>May 5 , 1998</DATE> e-mail from <PERSON>Curley</PERSON> to <PERSON>Schultz</PERSON> and <PERSON>Spanier</PERSON> was titled " <PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> " and it says , " I have touched base with the coach . 
Keep us posted . 
Thanks . 
" A second e-mail dated <DATE>May 13 1998</DATE> from <PERSON>Curley</PERSON> to <PERSON>Schultz</PERSON> is titled " Jerry " andit says , " Anything new [ in ] this department ? 
Coach is anxious to know where itstands . 
" There is only one aspect in which the Freeh report does not totally destroyPaterno 's pretension of honesty . 
It finds no connection between the ' 98investigation and <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> 's resignation from <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's staff in <DATE>' 99</DATE> . 
The reportalso suggests that <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> genuinely believed the police had found no evidenceof a crime.Paterno can be forgiven for his initial denial , for refusing to believe hiscolleague was a child molester in <DATE>' 98</DATE> . 
What 's not forgivable is his sustaineddetermination to lie from <DATE>2001</DATE> onward.This is how <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> testified in <DATE>January 2011</DATE> before the grand jury . 
He wasasked : " Other than the [ <DATE>2001</DATE> ] incident that <PERSON>Mike McQueary</PERSON> reported to you , doyou know in any way , through rumor , direct knowledge or any other fashion , ofany other inappropriate sexual conduct by <PERSON>Jerry Sandusky</PERSON> with young boys ? 
" <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> replied , " I do not know of anything else that <PERSON>Jerry</PERSON> would be involved inof that nature , no . 
I do not know of it . 
" <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's family continued to insist <DATE>Thursday</DATE> via a statement that <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> ' saccount was not inconsistent with the facts , and he " always believed , as we do , that the full truth should be uncovered . 
" But <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> was no more interested in the full truth than Walt Disney.In his final interview , he played the faux-naif who insisted he had " never heardof rape and a man . " 
Who had n't followed up on <ORGANIZATION>McQueary</ORGANIZATION> 's report out ofsqueamishness . 
Who was wary of interfering in university " procedure . " 
Whoinsisted it was unfair to put <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> on trial along with a pedophile , andthat this was not " a football scandal . 
" In fact , in <DATE>2001</DATE> Paterno had every reason to suspect <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> was a serialdefiler of children . 
In fact , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> was not reluctant to interfere inuniversity procedure ; he helped dictate it . 
In fact , this was a footballscandal . 
The crimes were committed by a former assistant football coach in thefootball building . 
Ten boys , and 45 criminal counts , at least five of themmolested on the <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> campus after <DATE>1998</DATE> when <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> committed the awfulmisjudgment of continuing to allow <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> to bring boys to his locker room , sosure was he that <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> was " a good guy . 
" We ca n't un-rape and un-molest those boys . 
We ca n't remove them from the showersand seize them back from the hands of <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> . 
That should have been anunrelenting source of rage and grief to <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> . 
Yet in perhaps the mostdamaging observation of all , the Freeh report accuses <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> and his colleaguesof " a striking lack of empathy " for the victims.Everything else about <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> must now be questioned ; other details about himbegin to nag . 
You now wonder if his self-defense was all an exercise in sealingoff watertight compartments , leaving colleagues on the outside to drown . 
Youwonder if he performed a very neat trick in disguising himself as a modest andbenevolent man . 
The subtle but constant emphasis on his <ORGANIZATION>Ivy League</ORGANIZATION> education , the insistence that <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> football had higher standards , now looks morelike rampant elitism.Undeniably , for many years <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> did virtuous work at <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> . 
His combinedwinning records and graduation rates were indeed much higher than those of hispeers.It 's a relevant part of the <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> affair and worth stating , becauseit contributed to the institutional response . 
The Freeh report cited " numerousindividual failings , " but it also found " weaknesses of the <ORGANIZATION>University</ORGANIZATION> 's culture , governance , administration , compliance policies and procedures for protectingchildren . " 
As other commentators have rightly observed , <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> 's huge successeshelped form those potholes . 
He was the university 's culture.He was the self-appointed arbiter of character and justice in <ORGANIZATION>State College</ORGANIZATION> . 
Hehad decided <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> was " a good man " in <DATE>1998</DATE> , and he simply found it too hardto admit he made a fatal misjudgment and gave a child molester the officenearest to his . 
He was more interested in protecting a cardboard cutout legacythan the flesh and blood of young men.The only explanation I can find for this " striking lack of empathy " isself-absorption . 
In asking how a paragon of virtue could have behaved like sucha thoroughly bad guy , the only available answer is that <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> fell prey to thesingle most corrosive sin in sports : the belief that winning on the field makesyou better and more important than other people.jenkinss@washpost.comFor previous columns by <PERSON>Sally Jenkins</PERSON> , visit washingtonpost.com/jenkins.More coverage from <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post Sports : Freeh report reveals ' total disregard ' for victimshttp : / / www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/freeh-report-on-penn-states-handling-of-jerry-sanduskys-child-sex-abuse-reveals-total-disregard-for-victims/2012/07/12/gJQAfVoMfW_story.htmlDocument: Read the full Freeh reportSandusky found guilty on nearly all counts of child sex abusePaterno 's final interviewhttp : / / www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/joe-paternos-first-interview-since-the-penn-state-sandusky-scandal/2012/01/13/gIQA08e4yP_story.html_blank | Excerpts from interviewVideo : <PERSON>Paterno</PERSON> speaks following <LOCATION>Sandusky</LOCATION> allegations_blank_blankJenkins discusses her interview with Paterno_blankPoll : Does <ORGANIZATION>Penn State</ORGANIZATION> football deserve the <ORGANIZATION>NCAA</ORGANIZATION> 's death penalty?http : / / www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/post/does-penn-state-football-deserve-the-death-penalty/2012/07/12/gJQAM50SfW_blog.html#commentsEugene <PERSON>Robinson</PERSON> : <PERSON>Joe Paterno</PERSON> 's shame
