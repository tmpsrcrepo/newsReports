Florence Deacon wants a new pope " with experience of living with a lot ofordinary folks . 
Someone who understands the difficulty of having to live thegospel and at the same time get a little boy to eat his breakfast before he goesoff to school . 
" <PERSON>Margaret Farley</PERSON> wants to see a church leadership " marked by the grace oflistening and respect - and mutually so . 
" Deacon and <PERSON>Farley</PERSON> are not just Catholic women , they 're nuns . 
And both have runafoul of the administration of Pope <PERSON>Benedict XVI</PERSON> . 
Sister <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> is presidentof the <ORGANIZATION>Leadership Conference of Women Religious</ORGANIZATION> , which continues to beinvestigated for what the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> has called doctrinal inconsistencies , including " radical feminism . " 
Sister <PERSON>Margaret</PERSON> is an emerita professor at Yale.Her <DATE>2010</DATE> book , " Just Love , " was censured by the church 's Congregation for theDoctrine of the Faith for being " in direct contradiction with Catholic teachingon sexual morality . 
" No wonder these women , who have given their lives to God , hope for a pontiff whomight signal a new era of diversity , listening and respect , and an understandingof - if not experience with - the way real people live real lives.The <ORGANIZATION>Second Vatican Council</ORGANIZATION> ended with a resounding call for the inclusion ofwomen into church life . 
" The hour is coming , " read the council 's closing documents , " in which womenacquire in the world an influence , an effect and a power never hithertoachieved . 
That is why , at this moment . . . women imbued with a spirit of theGospel can do so much to aid humanity in not falling . 
" But that prescient rhetoric has turned up empty . 
The status of nuns within theCatholic organization , at least in the West , has dropped precipitously - and so , accordingly , have their numbers.Sister <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> says that although her organization represents 50,000 Americansisters , the LCWR has no regular audience with the pope . 
She has never met anypope . 
No one in the American church leadership has ever asked her opinion on amatter of national , political or ecclesiastical significance , such as thecontraception mandate in President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> 's health plan or the use of condoms toprevent the spread of AIDS.Regular meetings with church leaders would " allow you to see each other as realpeople , and if you have a question or a concern , you talk it over . 
You do n't letthings get blown out of proportion and let situations fester . 
It would be niceto have periodic access , " she says . 
Instead , the <ORGANIZATION>LCWR</ORGANIZATION> is in the position ofhaving to defend itself to the pope 's men against allegations made by the pope ' smen.In the meantime , the church hierarchy has closed ranks , appearing to the publicmore than ever like a group of old guys in dress-up , deaf to the real concernsof their members . 
Allegations of sexual abuse and coverups continue to ripplethrough the church at high levels , while an insistence on the immorality ofbirth control seems to define the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bishops ' public position on the entireuniverse of male-female relations . 
It is no wonder that the young leave theRoman <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> in larger numbers than members of most other Christiandenominations.Most mainline Christian denominations made their peace with women in leadershiproles in the past century , but the <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Church</ORGANIZATION> has not . 
Not only can womennot be ordained as priests , they are represented in very few real leadershiproles at all . 
In the dicasteries - the committees that together form the <ORGANIZATION>Vatican</ORGANIZATION> - very few of the highest-ranking administrators are women . 
About a quarter ofU.S . 
dioceses have put women in the position of chancellor , a job that can beeither very powerful or very bureaucratic , depending on the bishop in charge . 
" For the church to thrive , we must take seriously the role of women and createopportunities to elevate women to positions of meaningful leadership in thechurch , even in the Roman Curia , " says <PERSON>Kerry Robinson</PERSON> , executive director of <ORGANIZATION>theNational Leadership Roundtable on Church Management</ORGANIZATION> . 
" Pope <PERSON>Benedict XVI</PERSON> ' ssuccessor would do well to recognize that the church is impoverished when we donot avail ourselves of the full gifts and talents of women . 
" To that end , Sister <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> has done some research , and she contends thatthere 's no reason women ca n't become cardinals . 
In recent memory , cardinalshave been priests first , but " in the past , " she says , " people could have beenmade cardinals and then ordained . 
I have n't heard anyone seriously pushing this , but the cardinals are seen as advisers to the pope . 
" Sister <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> speaks like a person who enjoys being a bit of a provocateur . 
" It 's an idea to play around with , and it puts a twinkle in my eye .
