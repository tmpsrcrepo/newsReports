This week marks one year since Sens. <PERSON>Joe Manchin</PERSON> ( D-W . 
Va. ) and <PERSON>Pat Toomey</PERSON> ( R-Pa . ) 
formed their unlikely alliance to strengthen background-check laws ongun sales.Manchin was seeking a Republican to team up with after the school massacre inNewtown , <LOCATION>Conn</LOCATION> . 
So he approached border-state pal <PERSON>Toomey</PERSON> , and the two drafted amodest proposal that still enraged the <ORGANIZATION>National Rifle Association</ORGANIZATION> , and failed toget enough votes in the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> , but did earn them a spoof on " <DATE>Saturday</DATE> NightLive , " with actors <PERSON>Jason Sudeikis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bill Hader</PERSON> as their stand-ins . 
A year later , it was <PERSON>Toomey</PERSON> 's turn to ask for <PERSON>Manchin</PERSON> 's help on backgroundchecks - not for guns , but for school employees . 
The Republican senator has beenpushing a bill that would require any school that receives federal funds toperform background checks on all existing and new employees , includingcontractors . 
There is currently no national standard.On <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> , the senators penned an op-ed in the <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> Post-Gazette abouttheir latest joint effort . 
The legislation was inspired by the <DATE>1997</DATE> murder of a12-year-old boy in <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> by a teacher who had been fired from aPennsylvania school for molesting a student.Though their shared causes are solemn ones , the two senators seem to enjoy theirfraternity.Toomey told the Loop : " <PERSON>Joe Manchin</PERSON> is interested in getting things done . 
Thisis n't the first time or the last time we will team up on bipartisan legislation.He is a strong partner in my effort to protect children from sexual and violentpredators . 
" So the team 's back together . 
But do n't look for another " SNL " parody.Just a wee questionIt took a 6-year-old to leave <PERSON>Hillary Clinton</PERSON> speechless about her politicalplans.The former first lady , senator and secretary of state , who after <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> isofficially " thinking " about running for president , did not have an answer to afinal question from an elementary-schooler who inquired about the most pressingpolitical mystery - with a new twist . 
" In <DATE>2016</DATE> , would you prefer to be called Madam President or Mrs. President ? " 
thegirl asked through a moderator at an event in <LOCATION>Portland</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ore.</LOCATION> ( Yes , sticklers ,2017 would be the year for such choices - but the kid is 6 and delightfullyprecocious . ) 
Her question drew applause and laughter as <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> sat smiling - but neveranswering . 
She leaned in toward the moderator and said it was a really goodquestion . 
As she got up to walk off stage , she paused , looked at the audienceand offered an exaggerated shrug.The Loop believes the young questioner has a promising future in politicaljournalism.In debt , but on timeFacing jail time does not come with a " Get Out of Campaign Finance Reporting " card.Disgraced former congressman <PERSON>Rick Renzi</PERSON> ( R-Ariz . ) 
, charged with several countsof public corruption that included embezzling money from a family business tohelp pay for his first congressional campaign in <DATE>2002</DATE> , filed his <ORGANIZATION>quarterlyFederal Election Commission</ORGANIZATION> report <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> . 
It shows him nearly half a milliondollars in debt.Renzi , who did not seek reelection in <DATE>2008</DATE> , because he was under investigation , faces three years in prison . 
But he appealed the charges , and a federal courtagreed in <DATE>February</DATE> to let him stay out of jail during the appeal.Most of the debt is from personal loans <PERSON>Renzi</PERSON> made to his campaign committee , though he owes <PERSON>Patton Boggs</PERSON> <MONEY>$ 106,157</MONEY> in legal fees . 
Renzi 's campaign coffershave <MONEY>$ 1,244</MONEY> left - little surprise , no campaign donations came in <DATE>last quarter</DATE> - so the lawyers probably wo n't see that money anytime soon.But the campaign got its 11-page report filed on time , so that 's something.It 's not uncommon for politicians to use their hard-earned fundraising dollarsto pay legal bills that result from their own alleged wrongdoing . 
In <DATE>February</DATE> , for example , <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> election officials said Gov. <PERSON>Chris Christie</PERSON> ( R ) coulduse his campaign money to pay back bills incurred in the bridge matter.Let 's go to the videotape!Washington 's latest sex scandal - involving newly installed Rep. VanceMcAllister ( R-La . ) 
and an aide - may seem just another in a long history ofsordid behavior on the part of congressional and administration officials . 
Butthis appears to be the first uncovered by actual video evidence.There have been photos , of course - for example , a selfie tweeted by then-Rep . 
<PERSON>Anthony Weiner</PERSON> ( D-N.Y. ) . 
Other scandals have included flirtatious e-mails , suchas those that led to the resignations of Reps. <PERSON>Mark Foley</PERSON> ( R-Fla . ) 
and <ORGANIZATION>ChrisLee</ORGANIZATION> ( R-N . 
Y ) . 
And there was the spectacular video of President <PERSON>Bill Clintonhugging Monica Lewinsky</PERSON> along a rope line of supporters greeting him on theSouth Lawn of the White House.But most often there are scarcely any photos of the two lovers together , muchless a videotape showing them , if not in flagrante delicto , then at leastseriously making out . 
The surveillance video allegedly shows the marriedMcAllister , with the back of his shirt out , and <PERSON>Melissa Peacock</PERSON> , hisalso-married district scheduler , in an extended and most passionate embrace.And although there have been calls for <PERSON>McAllister</PERSON> 's resignation ( <ORGANIZATION>Peacock</ORGANIZATION> isalready off the payroll ) , the congressman told the <ORGANIZATION>Monroe News Star</ORGANIZATION> that heintends to run for reelection " unless there is an outcry for me not to serve , and so far there has been an outpouring of support . 
" Well , people can surmount these obstacles . 
Remember that Mark " The Hiker " Sanford , then the governor of <LOCATION>South Carolina</LOCATION> , told his wife he was on theAppalachian Trail when in fact he went to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> to be with his mistress.Last year , the Republican easily won election to the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> .
