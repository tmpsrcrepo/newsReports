For 11 days of the 14-day Occupy Wall Street march from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> 's <PERSON>Zuccotti Parkto</PERSON> <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> last month , I joined dozens of protesters as they trekked throughrainstorms and 30-degree chill . 
They slept in tents ; ate handouts of Halloweencandy and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches ; and endured severe shinsplints , knee injuries and catcalls of " Get a job ! " 
They argued among themselves as muchas with others they met along the way.As this odyssey ended , I thought about the public perception of the Occupymovement and about the Occupiers I 'd met on the road . 
There is the Occupy shownby the news media , defined by police clashes and a lack of hygiene - images thattell non-Occupiers that the movement is leaderless , chaotic and on its way out.But as the marchers passed through towns large and small , and ordinary Americanscame out of their homes and businesses to give food , money and words of support , it became clear that this movement is n't going away.Since its encampments are being shut down by local authorities across thecountry , the movement is now Occupying by walking rather than staying put . 
Andanother march , which departed <DATE>Thursday</DATE> from the <ORGANIZATION>Martin Luther King Jr.</ORGANIZATION> memorialin <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , plans to travel more than 600 miles to the civil rights leader ' sgrave site in Atlanta.Certainly , Occupy Wall Street protesters have different ideas about themovement 's mission . 
Many of the marchers I met even disagreed on the purpose oftheir trek - some thought it was about getting to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> to protest the " supercommittee " ; others thought it was about visiting other Occupations.But here are four who , in different ways , represent what the movement wants : direct democracy , accountable leadership , and a country that listens toeveryone 's voice and believes in second <PERSON>chances.Kelley Brannon</PERSON> , 27 , an organizer of the march , says she intended for thejourney to spread pure democracy , a form of decision-making in which everyperson votes on every decision , as widely as possible.On <DATE>Nov. 17</DATE> , Day 9 of the march , <PERSON>Brannon</PERSON> calls for a general assembly to recruitnew Occupiers along the highway near <LOCATION>North East</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Md.</LOCATION> " We need to have a general assembly now , " she says . 
" It 's our last chance in thelight . 
" Another marcher objects : " We said we 'd do general assemblies when we are donefor the day . 
We are n't done . " 
" I 'm going to move to split the march into groups , " <PERSON>Brannon</PERSON> responds . 
" One groupwho came here for the original purpose and one who came here for somethingelse ! 
" The group does not split up . 
But along the way , it loses a handful of marchers - and picks up many more.Brannon had been camped in <LOCATION>Zuccotti Park</LOCATION> since <DATE>Sept. 17</DATE> , heeding <ORGANIZATION>Adbusters</ORGANIZATION> ' callover the <DATE>summer</DATE> to Occupy Wall Street on that date . 
She 's a natural leader in aleaderless movement , and her attempts to be in control do n't sit well with a lotof the marchers , especially since she 's hardly the diplomatic sort . 
( At aDunkin ' Donuts near <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> , she tells someone holding a coffee : " I thinkthe fact that we 're supporting giant corporations is pretty disgusting . " ) 
Before <PERSON>Brannon</PERSON> started Occupying , she spent her time in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> creating filmsand multimedia art - and , to pay her rent , making sandwiches at a cafe . 
" I ' mmaking the same money I made in high school 10 years ago , " she says , laughingbitterly.She later tells me that her art will be featured this month in a <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> coffeeshop , where she plans to charge less than <MONEY>$ 100</MONEY> for each piece . 
" I do n't make art for the <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> , " she says . 
" So I 'm not going to charge 1percent prices . 
" That is , if she sells them at all . 
" I 'm a really bad artist because I do n't like selling my work . 
It feels like I ' mselling myself , " she says.After the march , <PERSON>Brannon</PERSON> returned to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> , where she is taking a break fromOccupy to edit her footage of the journey.Ephraim <PERSON>Cruz</PERSON> does n't say anything about the pot-smoking , the dozen homelesspeople stealing protesters ' food or the rape investigation that was announcedjust after we arrived at <LOCATION>Occupy Philadelphia</LOCATION> , one of the <ORGANIZATION>East Coast</ORGANIZATION> 's roughestencampments . 
But after night falls on Day 6 of the march , a young man at thesite gets in another 's face , holds his collar and demands money . 
Cruz steps in . 
" You take your thuggin ' and buggin ' somewhere else , " he says to the aggressor.The kid backs off . 
" And you , " <PERSON>Cruz</PERSON> says , turning to the other , " if you owe him money , pay up . 
" Cruz , in his late 30s , says he got his sense of justice growing up in the Bronxas one of seven children raised by a single mother who eked by on socialprograms . 
Since age 18 , he has been an auxiliary officer in the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> PoliceDepartment , a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Border Patrol agent , a candidate for the <LOCATION>Arizona</LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION>Houseof Representatives</ORGANIZATION> and a campaigner for <PERSON>Barack Obama.But Cruz</PERSON> has always been an idealist , and in recent years he thought that thegovernment just kept coming up short . 
In <DATE>2004</DATE> , he became a whistleblower againstthe <ORGANIZATION>Border Patrol</ORGANIZATION> , alleging that the agency mistreated immigrants caughtcrossing the U.S.-Mexico border.In <DATE>2009</DATE> , he grew disenchanted with President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> after the health-care fight.And on the morning after the <ORGANIZATION>NYPD</ORGANIZATION> 's <DATE>Nov. 15</DATE> raid on <LOCATION>Zuccotti Park</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Cruz</PERSON> callshis other former employer a " legal gang . 
" Cruz does n't finish the march , disappearing after <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> , two days before thegroup reaches <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . 
Like the leaders who had disappointed him before , themarch co-organizers did n't hold themselves accountable , he thought , giving himno choice but to leave them behind , too.Cruz has returned to <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> , where he 's a major player with Occupy the <PERSON>Bronx.Cologino Rivera</PERSON> , 21 , gets a lot of laughs among his fellow marchers for hisaccent , which brings to mind the ersatz Kazakh star of the <DATE>2006</DATE> mockumentary " Borat . " 
Rivera laughs along with the jokes , quickly assuming the role of thegroup 's jester . 
When I ask him early on what he 'll do after the march , he quipsthat he 'll go to <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> to " occupy the beach . 
" A few days later , <PERSON>Rivera</PERSON> gets more serious . 
He says he was inspired to joinOccupy after months of working 60-hour weeks as a waiter in <LOCATION>Owego</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>N.Y.</LOCATION> " Sometimes when I look at my check , it makes me want to cry , " he says . 
At age15 , he left <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> - a country " in a very depressed state , [ where ] jobs arescarce " - for the land of opportunity , but he quickly found that it did n'talways live up to its promise.He says he left his country because his family members inexplicably kept gettingshot . 
" I think it 's wonderful in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> that people ca n't just get away withanything , " he says . 
In <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> , no one was charged with his uncle 's shooting.Here , maybe it would have been different.On <DATE>Day 4</DATE> , at a rest stop somewhere past <LOCATION>Trenton</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Rivera</PERSON> addresses the fullgroup for the first time . 
" I have an announcement , " he says.The group giggles.He tries again : " I 'm trying to talk ! 
" More laughing . 
" Listen , I understand I have an accent . 
This is not news to me ! 
I immigratedhere more than <DATE>five years ago</DATE> . 
" His voice rises and quiet seeps in . 
" You need to listen to my voice , not my accent ! 
You need to have respect . 
" Finally , a space for <PERSON>Rivera</PERSON> to get serious : " Now , I will start a list ofnecessary needs for the march . . . " " This is good , " a marcher says to me , smiling . 
" He feels empowered . 
" <PERSON>Rivera</PERSON> joined the marchers who left <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> for <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> on Thursday.Melvin <PERSON>Hicks</PERSON> frequently gets impatient as personalities clash and tensions risealong the march . 
" I do n't think this group is ready for a day of action ! " 
<PERSON>Hicks</PERSON> says , his wordsslurring as he gets angry , speaking through missing teeth . 
" If we ca n't come toone issue to agree upon , we are no better than the people in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . 
" <PERSON>Hicks</PERSON> dislikes the journalists who show up along the way , the long discussionsabout changing the marchers ' route . 
He dislikes stopping for breaks at all . 
Hisonly detour : On <DATE>Day 11</DATE> , en route to <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> , he scrawls " We are the 99percent " in freshly poured sidewalk concrete.But like many others who are frustrated , <PERSON>Hicks</PERSON> is n't about to leave the march.Hicks , who is in his early 30s , says he was convicted more than a decade ago ofdrug trafficking , joining the <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> of Americans who have been convicted ofa felony , and he 's had trouble finding a job because of his criminal past . 
Henow works as an electrician.When asked why he 's marching , he says , " I want <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> not to judge me for mypast , but for my future . 
" On a night when another marcher is smoking a joint , <PERSON>Hicks</PERSON> does n't partake . 
Hedoes n't drink , either , even when the other marchers get beers in <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> on <DATE>aFriday</DATE> <TIME>night</TIME> . 
<PERSON>Hicks</PERSON> - much like the Occupy movement - wants to do something morethan just get arrested . 
" I got to rise for what I believe in , " he says . 
" BecauseI know we are doing the right thing . 
" After the march , <PERSON>Hicks</PERSON> , who does not have a phone or an e-mail address , couldnot be found.elizabeth.flock@washingtonpost.comElizabeth Flock is a blogger for <ORGANIZATION>The Washington Post</ORGANIZATION> 's BlogPost .
