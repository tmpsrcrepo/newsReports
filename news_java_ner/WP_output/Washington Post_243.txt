Every month or so , in the parade of offenders coming before her in court , she ' dspot a military veteran.Usually it was for a misde-meanor , a squabble , assault and battery , somethingpetty.Then <PERSON>Penney S. Azcarate</PERSON> , chief judge of the <ORGANIZATION>Fairfax County General DistrictCourt</ORGANIZATION> , would see the same guy in court again . 
For something more serious.And in each of her six years on the bench , <PERSON>Azcarate</PERSON> saw more and more veteransunravel before her in just this way . 
" It 's probably up to a few every week now , " said <PERSON>Azcarate</PERSON> , 48 , who served in theMarines in the <DATE>1991</DATE> Persian Gulf War before going to law school and becoming acounty prosecutor.In a county that has one of the nation 's highest concentrations of veterans - about 85,000 , according to <ORGANIZATION>George Mason University</ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON>Laurie Neff</PERSON> - the cost of war is on gut-wrenching display in the courthouse every day.Azcarate and the nine other judges in her court see the patterns . 
They ' regetting a stream of veterans who had no criminal record before they went intothe military rack up rap sheets as they battle post-traumatic stress disorder , traumatic brain injury , substance abuse or the fallout from sexual assault.The spiral often ends in one of two ways : First is serious prison time . 
There are so many vets at the medium-securityIndian <ORGANIZATION>Creek Correctional Center</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Chesapeake</LOCATION> that the <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Department ofCorrections has created two special dorms for them decorated with murals of theNavy 's Blue Angels and other military logos and insignia.In <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> , 76 veterans are jailed , said <PERSON>Neff</PERSON> , who also served in the <LOCATION>Marinesand</LOCATION> is director of the law school 's Clinic for Legal Assistance toServicemembers and Veterans . 
About <PERCENT>10 percent</PERCENT> of the nation 's prisoners onceserved in the military.Second is suicide . 
Every day , about 22 veterans kill themselves . 
That 's onealmost every <PERSON>hour.Seth Masterson</PERSON> , 29 , was on a fast path to one of those outcomes.He served in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> during the bloodiest year , 2006-07 . 
In a photo with 15 of hisfriends , five are circled in red . 
All of them have severe PTSD , most have beenlocked up , one killed himself.Masterson came home after seeing his best friend die and had a difficult timeslipping back into the life that the other <PERCENT>99 percent</PERCENT> of Americans were living - shopping , rush-hour traffic , child care.As a <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> police officer , he was getting written up a lot . 
He lashed out atco-workers , and on the day he was denied treatment for PTSD , he threatened tokill his wife.He was relieved of his duties and divorced by his wife . 
He lost custody of hisson.All of it could have been avoided if his PTSD had been caught and treated early , he said at a meeting last month with judges , fellow vets , social workers , advocates and court officials.The damage - psychological and physical - we 're seeing in our nation 's veteransis historic . 
" With only <PERCENT>1 percent</PERCENT> of our population wearing the uniform , you have a system ofmilitary personnel going out on deployment four or six times , " <PERSON>Azcarate</PERSON> said . 
" This has an amazing impact on your mental health , and it 's unprecedented in ourhistory - <DATE>22</DATE> suicides a day . 
We have to learn how to deal with this epidemic . 
" Azcarate thinks she knows one way to begin . 
At the meeting , she outlined herplan to create a veterans treatment docket in <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> , much like the veteranstreatment courts already operating around the country . 
The way the system worksright now , there 's no way to know who is a veteran . 
" Sometimes , if they 're at parade rest , I see it , " <PERSON>Azcarate</PERSON> said . 
Or they ' llthrow out some jargon . 
But unless they identify as a veteran or an attorneypoints it out , it 's not so easy for a judge to consider the possibility thatcombat-related syndromes could have been a factor . 
" And maybe we can address those issues before they escalate , preventrecidivism , " she said.Once a defendant is identified as a veteran and is placed on the special docket , the court would connect the offender with the kind of services or treatment heshould be getting.Sometimes , the guy who just got locked up for a bar fight needs to be in apsychiatrist 's office , talking about the wartime trauma he witnessed rather thancooling his heels in a jail cell.Azcarate 's plan is to get this up and running by <DATE>January</DATE> . 
" I just want to catchthem early enough before it turns deadly , " she said.These kinds of courts are becoming increasingly popular , with at least one innearly half the nation 's states.And it 's about time <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> begins acknowledging the special needs of its hugeveteran population with more than monuments , memorials and meal deals.The state is the nation 's 12th-most populated , but it has the sixth-largestveteran population , with nearly 850,000 who 've served , and it 's the only statewith a growing military population , <PERSON>Neff</PERSON> said.Azcarate does n't like to quote <PERSON>Hillary Rodham Clinton</PERSON> much but said it takes avillage to return a military veteran to society.A court that catches veterans when they begin to fall is an important step.We 've lost enough people in battle on foreign turf . 
The least we can do is endthe battle they face at home.petula.dvorak@washpost.comTo read previous columns , go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak .
