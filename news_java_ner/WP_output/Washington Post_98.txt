Candidate : President BushImages : Young girl pouring milk in a kitchen ; <PERSON>John Kerry</PERSON> speaking ; a girlplaying on a suburban porch ; another boarding a school bus.Time : 30 secondsAudio : When it comes to issues that affect our families , are <PERSON>John Kerry</PERSON> ' spriorities the same as yours ? 
Kerry voted against parental notification forteenage abortions . 
Kerry even voted to allow schools to hand out the " morning-after " pill without parents ' knowledge . 
He voted to take control awayfrom parents by taking away their right to know . 
<PERSON>John Kerry</PERSON> has his priorities.The question is , are they yours?Analysis : This ad , with a female narrator , continues the president 's " values " assault against <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> and tries to frame the abortion issue in a way that makeshim appear insensitive to parents.Kerry in <DATE>1991</DATE> voted against a Republican amendment to force clinics to notifyparents when a minor seeks an abortion . 
But he voted for a Democratic amendmentto allow adults other than the parents to determine whether a girl was matureenough to decide on her own . 
<PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> says he , like the American MedicalAssociation , opposes mandatory notification because it could put some girls atrisk of abuse , family violence , late-term abortions or unwanted childbirth , andthat his approach allows judicial exceptions with the consent of other relativesand the girl 's doctor . 
In <DATE>2000</DATE> , <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> voted to kill an amendment barring federal funds for thedistribution of the " morning-after " contraceptive pill on school grounds . 
Kerrysays schools should be able to provide such contraception to girls who arevictims of rape or incest or not covered by insurance.In both cases , the votes cited are accurate , but <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> 's explanations , howeverwell argued , are complicated.The <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> camp also released a radio ad , airing on African American stations inseven cities from <LOCATION>Philadelphia</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Cleveland</LOCATION> , that repeats these charges andrecycles others in attacking <PERSON>Kerry</PERSON> 's " extreme voting record . " 
The spot follows aKerry television ad targeted at black voters , but <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> strategists say thatunlike the senator they are not tailoring separate messages for differentgroups .
