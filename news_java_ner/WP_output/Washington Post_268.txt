If you 're an <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> player , you must want to punch <PERSON>Aaron Hernandez</PERSON> in hisdumb-sullen jaw for making his face into the face of the league . 
If you have anykind of pride in your profession , you must want to shove him in the tattooedchest , with the florid stupidities etched on it , and tell him to quit spillinghis ink all over you and your teammates.Appearances matter , not as a moral issue but from a purely practical standpoint.That 's the lesson to take from <PERSON>Hernandez</PERSON> 's self-portrait as a pop-style killerwith a dead jailhouse gaze , one dangerously in love with his muscled-up arms . 
Ifhe 's innocent , good luck proving it to the masses and a jury . 
It would be niceto say <PERSON>Hernandez</PERSON> 's appearance in court is his problem and his alone , but itis n't . 
It has become the problem of every guy he played with or against becauseHernandez has convinced many people , <PERSON>Geraldo Rivera</PERSON> and Rush Limbaugh amongthem , that the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> wittingly harbors gang executioners.Hernandez 's example has become Exhibit A for braying commentators who havepainted the entire league in stigmas as crude as snake and dagger tattoos.Rivera denounced the league 's " jungle ethos " and - incredibly - described NFLplayers as " fatherless " products recruited from the " inner city " in need of " minders . " 
Actually , <PERSON>Hernandez</PERSON> was not fatherless , and he 's from middle-classConnecticut suburbs , not the inner city , and we all know what that 1970seuphemism means . 
It means poor and non-white and therefore brutal . 
Rivera wasfollowed closely by <PERSON>Limbaugh</PERSON> , who said , " This has the potential to blow the lidopen on the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> and gangs and the whole concept . 
" Here is a fact that you may find hard to believe after listening to them : NFLplayers commit crimes at a much lower rate than their peers in the generalpopulation . 
Around 2,700 players pass through <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> training camps every season , and 1,696 make rosters . 
Yes , some of them get arrested - about 2 to <PERCENT>3 percent</PERCENT> ayear . 
The national arrest rate for males aged 22 to 34 ? 
It 's <PERCENT>10.8 percent</PERCENT> , according to <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> crime statistics for <DATE>2009</DATE> . 
There have been a grand total of 34 arrests of <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> players since the Super Bowl , according to a crime database compiled by the <LOCATION>San Diego Tribune</LOCATION> . 
If that numbersounds high , juxtapose it next to the 1,600-plus men who did not get arrestedand who did exactly nothing to deserve the phrase " jungle ethos . 
" Now let 's take a look at some of those arrests , break them down and see whatkind of crimes they were.Seven of the arrests were for DUIs . 
This is not a great statistic , yet it ' shardly surprising , given that men between the ages of 21 and 25 are the worstoffenders when it comes to drunken driving . 
One study in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> showed thatthe age group has a DUI arrest rate of about 17 per 1,000 licensed drivers.Two of the arrests were for public intoxication . 
Three were for marijuanapossession . 
Three more belong in the category of risky or feckless butcomparatively benign behavior : Cardinals running back Javarris <PERSON>James</PERSON> failed toappear for a court proceeding , <ORGANIZATION>Eagles</ORGANIZATION> tackle <PERSON>Jason Peters</PERSON> got caught drag racingand Broncos safety <PERSON>Quinton Carter</PERSON> tried to cheat in a casino.One was an arrest for minor weapons charges , when a player forgot he had alegally registered handgun in his luggage and took it to an airport.At least six arrests were for violence-related crimes and were matters of thedeepest concern . 
One was Browns linebacker <PERSON>Ausar Walcott</PERSON> , who almost killed aman with a punch in a bar fight.Jets running back <PERSON>Mike Goodson</PERSON> faces an assortment of charges for riding in acar found to contain a loaded semi-automatic weapon with hollow point bullets , as well as drug paraphernalia . 
Browns defensive lineman <PERSON>Desmond Bryant</PERSON> wasarrested for criminal mischief when he tried to break down the door of astranger 's home . 
And Colts safety <PERSON>Joe Lefeged</PERSON> was charged with carrying anunlicensed gun and fleeing police after a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> traffic stop.Then there is <PERSON>Hernandez</PERSON> , who is in another category altogether , charged with onemurder and under investigation for two more and who has pleaded innocentdespite the growing number of people who seem to get shot around him . 
Whoseself-portrait holding a <ORGANIZATION>Glock</ORGANIZATION> will haunt every sap in the league who getsarrested for too many cocktails or for pulling on a bong or who happens to havetats crawling up his arms . 
Right now the Limbaughs and Riveras are looking atthem all as if they need to be manacled and perp walked.As the previous recitation shows , the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> has its share of legal and socialproblems . 
And there is no minimizing the three notorious murder cases in thelast 15 years among <PERSON>Rae Carruth</PERSON> ( 2001 ) , <PERSON>Jovan Belcher</PERSON> last year and nowHernandez . 
Clearly it 's not always easy to tell the difference between men whoare talented at a violent game and men who are simply violent.But the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> is not the only organization that unwittingly harbors criminals . 
Themilitary had 26,000 cases of sexual assault last year . 
And for sheer volume ofcriminal activity , do n't look at the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> ; look at financial institutions , whichin <DATE>2011</DATE> accounted for 1,719 <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> cases . 
The statistics suggest the men who playfootball are , on the whole , less criminally violent than soldiers and moreethically respectable than looters with <ORGANIZATION>Harvard</ORGANIZATION> MBAs who commit acts of grandlarceny with " financial instruments . " 
Or the middle management creeps employedby <ORGANIZATION>Cleveland Browns</ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON>Jim Haslam</PERSON> at Pilot Oil , who have pleaded guilty tobilking long-haul truckers.The league constantly deals with stereotype . 
It fights an ongoing war againstportrayals of players as gun brandishing , wife-beating , uneducated , morallybankrupt , assaulting criminals . 
In fact , <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of retired <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> players overthe age of 50 have college degrees , compared with <PERCENT>30 percent</PERCENT> of the generalpopulation , according to a <ORGANIZATION>University of Michigan</ORGANIZATION> study . 
That same survey said64 percent of <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> retirees between the ages of 30 and 49 found are still marriedto their first wife . 
As a group they are more committed and disciplined thanmost employees , evince deep loyalty to their bosses and colleagues and sacrificetheir long-term health for their families . 
In return for which they get rantedat by fans for being overpaid and stigmatized as thugs by foaming commentatorsin need of story lines.So the next time <PERSON>Hernandez</PERSON> appears in court , do n't identify him as an NFLplayer . 
He 's not one anymore . 
And he never was a particularly representativeone.sally.jenkins@washpost.comFor <PERSON>Sally Jenkins</PERSON> 's previous columns , visit washingtonpost.com/jenkins.More on the <PERSON>Aaron Hernandez</PERSON> case : A charmed life turned tragicThe Early Lead : <PERSON>Hernandez</PERSON> is denied bailThe Early Lead : Ex-Patriots tight end is under investigation for <DATE>2012</DATE> murdersThe Early Lead : Hernandez jerseys are selling well on eBayThe Early Lead : A reported <DATE>2007</DATE> incident details trouble at <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION>
