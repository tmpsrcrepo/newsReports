Catching <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 's bicycle groper wo n't be easy , but we should n't let ouroutrage fade until he 's been found.This is the guy who sexually assaulted a young womanin <ORGANIZATION>Dupont Circle</ORGANIZATION> last week , in the middle of a bright , sunny <DATE>summer</DATE> day , in a nice part of town . 
He rodepast <PERSON>Liz Gorman</PERSON> on his bike , put his hand up her skirt , violated her , then spedoff.After reporting the attack to police , <PERSON>Gorman</PERSON> , a 25-year-old photographer , blogged about it , describing the man 's orange shirt , mountain bike and dark hat.He laughed through the whole thing , said <PERSON>Gorman</PERSON> , whose account of " walking whilefemale " immediately went viral.Nearly a week later , the jerk who assaulted her is still out there , looking forhis next victim.Police , who sent five patrol cars to the scene when <PERSON>Gorman</PERSON> called for help , areworking the case , but have nothing new to report . 
" We 're not taking this lightly , " <ORGANIZATION>3rd District</ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON>George Kucik</PERSON> said . 
These aretough cases to solve , he said , because they happen in an instant , and there isusually little evidence to go on . 
" A lot of times in these cases , if you catch him , you catch him right away , likeif an officer happens to be right there or someone just grabs him , " Kucik said.But there are leads that can be followed . 
The manager at the <ORGANIZATION>Carlyle Hotel</ORGANIZATION> , where security cameras may have caught the attack on the sidewalk , said policehave n't asked him for any footage yet.Some people have expressed doubt that <PERSON>Gorman</PERSON> could have been attacked from apassing bike.But not one reader , whose girlfriend also was assaulted by a bicyclist . 
" Pervs have not only the audacity but a lot of skill and accuracy with repeatedoffense , " wrote this man , who chased his girlfriend 's attacker down , yanked himoff the bike and was surprised to see that he was about 14 years old . 
" I would not question the mechanics of how <PERSON>Liz Gorman</PERSON> 's [ attacker ] did it , " hesaid in an e-mail . 
It obviously was n't the first time the guy had done this . 
And , unless he ' sstopped , it probably wo n't be the last time.Still , far worse crimes occur every day in the city than what happened toGorman , as she herself concedes.But that 's exactly the kind of attitude that got <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> police in trouble withHuman Rights Watch , which is finishing a 16-month investigation that says thedepartment is insensitive and inefficient when it comes to adult sexual assaults . 
" Our research indicates that a serious number of sexual assault cases are notbeing documented , " <PERSON>Sara Darehshori</PERSON> , senior counsel for <ORGANIZATION>Human Rights Watch</ORGANIZATION> , wrotein a <DATE>May 30</DATE> letter to <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> Police Chief Cathy Lanier.The study showed that often the number of reports at local hospitals is higherthan the number of police reports . 
That means not all victims who come to thehospital are interviewed by police , and plenty of the folks who do n't go to ahospital are blown off.Lanier lashed back , saying the research was flawed and giving the organization alist of ways in which the department is improving on this front.But even when sexual assault investigations get the full-court press , theyare n't easy to solve.http : / / mpdc.dc.gov / mpdc/frames .

pdf " title = " mpdc.dc.govJust ask the <LOCATION>New York PoliceDepartment</LOCATION> , where detectives believed they 'd found a serial groper who hadterrorized at least four women in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> earlier this year.But <PERSON>Kurt Vanderhoudewas</PERSON> not their man . 
Turns out that Vanderhoude just happenedto look like the groper . 
All the charges were dropped a month after hishigh-profile arrest.Despite the obstacles , the <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> police owe it to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> 's women to find theguy who groped Gorman.The attack on her resonated with so many women who 'd had similar experiences.Their e-mails to me were painful to read.They were assaulted while jogging in a <LOCATION>Maryland</LOCATION> park , riding the Metro , workingin their government office . 
Some reported it and were rebuffed or treatedpoorly , but most never said a word to anyone.And that gnawed at them . 
" Harkens me back to an assault more than 30 years ago , " one woman wrote . 
" I waswalking to the train station in <LOCATION>Gaithersburg</LOCATION> , when a well-dressed young man in abrown suede jacket fell into step with me . 
It was easy to assume he was a fellowcommuter . 
" The man groped the woman , and she spun around to hit him with her briefcase butmissed.She did n't report it but kept seeing him at the train station . 
She switched herroutes , ducking , dodging . 
Several months later , a couple of young girls weresexually assaulted , and someone was arrested . 
" I never saw brown-jacket man again , and felt guilt over never reporting theoriginal incident , " assuming it was her attacker who had moved on to the girls , she wrote . 
She signed her note " Should Have Known Better . " 
" The problem with sexual assault is that you remember it not as if it wasyesterday , but as if it just happened , " a 66-year-old woman wrote to me.She , too , was assaulted out in the open , on a busy block of <ORGANIZATION>Madison Avenue inNew York City</ORGANIZATION> . 
" I wore a yellow madras shirtwaist dress . 
Remember madras ? 
The sidewalk was verycrowded . 
I felt a large hand grope my crotch from someone who had seemed to cometoward me . 
Though surprised , I turned around to see who it was as he wascontinuing on his way - just a crowd of bobbing heads , " she wrote.It happened in <DATE>1963</DATE> . 
" Writing this is cathartic , " she wrote . 
" I think I 'm going to cry . 
" This is why we should care .
