People who " disagree " with Church teachings are not denied Communion.Politicians who publicly support a practice -- abortion -- that contradicts thevery heart of Christian philosophy about life and the soul are denied theEucharist . 
As one supports the destruction of a new individual , one turns one ' sface from God and from the faith community . 
It has nothing to do with politics.It has everything to do with the blessed unity of a group of believers who dareto stand out against <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> 's modern holocaust . 
-- <PERSON>Rachel Lee Poole</PERSON> , <LOCATION>Fairfax</LOCATION> StationCommunion is the right of every Christian , based solely on the conscience of theperson receiving Communion . 
The priest is merely the provider . 
As Christians , weare not supposed to make judgments about people , only their behavior . 
Thus , wecan incarcerate someone as a danger to society based on behavior , but we cannotmake judgments about that person 's soul . 
Only God can do that , and that is whythe Church is opposed to capital punishment.Refusing Communion to anyone is tantamount to blasphemy because the priest takesfor himself something that belongs only to God -- judging a human being 's soul . 
-- <PERSON>William A. Miner</PERSON> , AlexandriaThe word " communion " implies that we are in union with the <ORGANIZATION>Church</ORGANIZATION> , her teachingsand that we want what she offers , namely the Eucharist ( Communion ) . 
If apolitician is not in union with the Church or her teachings , does not accept andlive them , then I have to ask : " Why do you want Communion ? 
Is this just a showfor you ? " 
-- <PERSON>Sara McCray</PERSON> , ArlingtonI am a fifth-generation <ORGANIZATION>African American Catholic</ORGANIZATION> . 
When my ancestors becameCatholic , the church hierarchy not only was silent on the question of themorality of slavery in this country , but there were some Catholic churches whereblacks could not worship with whites.I find it troubling that the Church hierarchy , all men , is so selective aboutthe issues that cause them to climb on moral high ground.I am also irate that the one issue they focus on , almost to the point ofobsession , is abortion . 
Abortion is legal in this country . 
Period . 
On the otherhand , sexual abuse of children is not . 
When the church hierarchy forbidscardinals , bishops and priests who are guilty of sexual abuse or complicit incovering up sex abuse from either distributing or receiving Communionthemselves , then their calls for denying Communion to pro-choice Catholics wo n'thave the ring of hypocrisy that they do now . 
-- <PERSON>Roxanne Evans</PERSON> , WashingtonCatholics conscious of manifestly grave sin ( advocating and/or voting forliberal pro-abortion laws ) should deny themselves Holy Communion . 
What anindividual bishop or priest does in denying or not denying Communion to one ofthe Roman Catholic faithful is only a matter of prudence on the bishop 's orpriest 's part . 
If a Catholic is conscious of having committed grave sin and hasnot been forgiven of that sin in the Sacrament of Confession , then he or shebrings condemnation upon himself or herself by receiving . 
-- <PERSON>Gene Arbogast</PERSON> , SpringfieldNo . 
A priest should never withhold the <ORGANIZATION>Body of Christ</ORGANIZATION> [ from ] a Catholic . 
God isthe only one who truly knows what is in the recipient 's heart.However , a politician should not " pretend " to be a Catholic if he does n't upholdthe teachings of the <ORGANIZATION>Church</ORGANIZATION> . 
Supporting abortion is directly contrary to theChurch 's position on upholding the dignity and sanctity of all life -- born andunborn .
