Whoa , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . 
You 're totally confusing us here.Rainbow flags and Old Sparky in the same week?When news broke <DATE>Thursday</DATE> that <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON>Mark R. Herring</PERSON> willfight the state 's ban on same-sex marriage - after he voted for it eight yearsago - it seemed that the time had come to start calling the commonwealth NewDominion.But before you think that <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> is going all squishy liberal , the state Houseof Delegates ( remember , those guys who proposed that whole vaginal probe thing ) overwhelmingly passed a bill to make the electric chair the default method ofexecution if lethal injection is not available . 
Right now , electrocution is usedonly if a Death Row inmate requests it.Turns out that the European manufacturers of the drugs used in lethal injectionswo n't sell them to executioners anymore , so it 's becoming harder for states toeuthanize people . 
In most business scenarios , when you 're cut off , it meansyou 're doing something pretty bad.But <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's leaders did n't use the moment as an opportunity to look back onthe cases of 16 men in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> who have been exonerated by the InnocenceProject - including <PERSON>Earl Washington Jr.</PERSON> , who came within days of being executedfor a murder and rape he did not commit - and rethink the state 's dedication toexecutions.Instead , they want to go all 1800s on us with the electric chair , ensuringthat 's how the 10 people on Death Row will die.In many ways , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> offers a fascinating window on American culture rightnow . 
We 're undergoing swift change in some areas , but in other ways we remainpretty draconian.And when you look at how changes , or the lack of them , are playing out acrossthe country - from marriage equality to minimum wage laws to family leavepolicies - we Americans come off as pretty schizophrenic in our values.For example , 33 states , including <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , still ban same-sex marriage , whilethe rest have moved to legalize it.So <ORGANIZATION>Herring</ORGANIZATION> 's plan to fight the law is huge news . 
Legalizing same-sex marriagewould put <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> on the right side of history - unlike in the battle forinterracial marriage . 
In <DATE>1958</DATE> , the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> overturned the arrest ofMildred and <ORGANIZATION>Richard Loving</ORGANIZATION> by <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> authorities for violating state laws , clearing the legal path to marriage for interracial couples across the country.This time , the commonwealth has a chance to do it right from the start.And the change in <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's same-sex equality laws could be what spurs changeacross the rest of the country.This is <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> 's new role in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , apparently . 
During the last twopresidential elections , the pundit chatter was all about <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> becoming oneof the hot , new swing states.From <DATE>1968</DATE> to <DATE>2008</DATE> , Virginians had steadfastly voted for Republicans . 
But duringthe past two national elections , the increasingly diverse state has shiftedDemocratic and become a bellwether state by voting for President Obama.Herring said he changed his mind on rights for same-sex couples because theworld around him - including his kids - helped him evolve . 
" I had voted against marriage equality eight years ago , back in <DATE>2006</DATE> , eventhough at the time I was speaking out against discrimination and ways to enddiscrimination , and I was wrong for not applying it to marriage , " Herring toldNPR 's " Morning Edition " on <DATE>Thursday</DATE> . 
" I saw very soon after how that hurt a lotof people , and it was very painful for a lot of people . 
" Herring 's thoughtful evolution brings us back to Old Sparky.Wouldn ' t it be wonderful to see the state 's delegation rethink its status as oneof 32 states that still support the death penalty?Recently , legislators have been conflicted about the practice , anyway . 
Theytried to expand capital punishment to include accomplices <DATE>four years ago</DATE> , butthat bill was shut down by the <ORGANIZATION>Senate Courts of Justice</ORGANIZATION> committee after a stateexecutioner , <PERSON>Jerry Givens</PERSON> , testified about the difficulty of carrying out 62executions over the course of 25 years . 
" The people who pass these bills , they do n't have to do it , " he said afterward . 
" The people who do the executions , they 're the ones who suffer through it . 
" Keep listening , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> . 
Keep showing the rest of the country how to gracefullygrow into change.petula.dvorak@washpost.com√Ø ... OE For previous columns , go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak .
