You ca n't just walk into <PERSON>Billy Martin</PERSON> 's law firm , <ORGANIZATION>Martin & Gitner</ORGANIZATION> . 
You have tobe buzzed in . 
It 's a K Street address after all , home to some of the mostwell-known and well-respected law firms in the country.Once inside the double glass doors and beyond the L-shaped reception desk withgranite countertops , you 'll find <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> , 65 , down the hall looking verycorporate in a gray suit and red tie.His eighth-floor office is cluttered : Binders , backpacks and books about SupremeCourt Justice <PERSON>Clarence Thomas</PERSON> and wrongful executions rest on the windowsill . 
Aputter , chipping cup and ball are propped in a corner .

Martin a decade ago after being namedone of Washingtonian magazine 's top <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> lawyers . 
" I 'm usually in it every year , " he says unapologetically . 
" I 'm one of the mostrecognized lawyers in <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , and I know that I 'm one of the most recognizedAfrican American lawyers in the country . 
" It sounds like unbridled arrogance , but <ORGANIZATION>Martin</ORGANIZATION> 's client roster would make agentsdrool : bad boys of the <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NHL</ORGANIZATION> . 
Big-name actors and politicians . 
Martinis the go-to attorney when you 're in trouble - real trouble.Facing-significant-prison-time trouble . 
He 's the lawyer people hire to get lesstime , when the evidence is stacked against them.According to those who have seen him in action , he 's brilliant at trial , particularly with opening statements and connecting with a jury . 
" When I was a clerk and went to the <ORGANIZATION>Public Defender 's Services</ORGANIZATION> , I wanted to belike <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> , " says <PERSON>Errol R. Arthur</PERSON> , now a <ORGANIZATION>D.C. Superior Court</ORGANIZATION> magistrate judge . 
" As a young attorney , you think , ' Wow , if I could just get to that level . ' 
" Attorney General <PERSON>Eric Holder</PERSON> describes him as " sophisticated " and a " goodtactician . " 
" He 's the kind of person to present the client with a factual , realisticdetermination of what the situation looks like , and that takes guts , particularly when they 're paying you , " says Holder , who has worked with <PERSON>Martinon</PERSON> several cases . 
" He can convince clients that the lawyer knows best . 
" Martin is the modern-day <PERSON>Johnnie Cochran</PERSON> , minus the bling and the brashness , butwith swag intact.As he arrived at <ORGANIZATION>D.C.

( The <ORGANIZATION>NFL</ORGANIZATION> suspendedhim last <DATE>February</DATE> for violating its substance-abuse policy , and the next day hewas charged with driving while intoxicated in <LOCATION>Fairfax County</LOCATION> . 
Those charges weredismissed at trial . ) 
After a 20-minute private briefing with <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> , <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> went upstairs to Courtroom119 to wait for the case to be called . 
" Lockup number 62 , " the clerk announced.Martin took his place as a shackled <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> emerged from a holding cell on theother side of the courtroom door . 
The charges were one count each of assault andattempted threats . 
The 6-foot-4-inch <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> let <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> do the talking ; it 's whathe gets paid <MONEY>$ 650</MONEY> an hour to do . 
" Not guilty , " <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said on behalf of his client during the eight-minutearraignment . 
The judge ordered <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> to stay away from his ex , <PERSON>Vergie Magbanua Arandid</PERSON> . 
" I spoke to Mr. <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> ; he has no problem staying away , " <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> told the judge.Reporters rushed outside to get a sound bite from <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> , who paused to choosehis words carefully . 
Everything <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> does is measured and calculated . 
" We 're really disappointed these charges were filed , " he told them . 
" <PERSON>Fred Davishas</PERSON> not been involved with assaulting or threatening this woman . 
" After fielding questions , <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> thanked the journalists , then slipped back intothe courthouse to hustle <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> to an SUV waiting out of sight for the drive backto <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> 's house in <LOCATION>Leesburg</LOCATION> , Va.The charges were later dropped after <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> asked prosecutors to " reevaluate " the case . 
" He 's a top-notch lawyer in demand , " says <PERSON>Inez Smith Reid</PERSON> , a senior judge on theD.C . 
Court of Appeals . 
" He 's expensive - very - but he 's worth it .

The Johnsons were led - handcuffed - from their home.Facing up to 20 years in prison , <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> turned to <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> , who rushed to thefederal courthouse in <LOCATION>Greenbelt</LOCATION> to meet with him after getting a call fromJohnson 's son , <PERSON>Jack Jr.</PERSON> " I like <PERSON>Jack</PERSON> , " <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> says.The two met about 20 years ago when <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> was the county 's deputy state ' sattorney . 
Martin and <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> were both <ORGANIZATION>Howard University</ORGANIZATION> grads , avid golfers andhad mutual friends . 
They clicked.Martin stood by <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> throughout the ordeal that ended with <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> amblinginto the courthouse with a cane a few weeks after his arrest . 
Depression andParkinson 's disease , he told the judge , who sentenced <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> to 87 months . 
Healso fined him <MONEY>$ 100,000</MONEY> and ordered him to undergo alcohol treatment and forfeit <MONEY>$ 78,000</MONEY> and his antique Mercedes .

Vick hired <ORGANIZATION>Martin</ORGANIZATION> , pleaded guilty in 2007and received a 23-month sentence.Former <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> mayor <PERSON>William</PERSON> " Bill " <PERSON>Campbell</PERSON> retained <ORGANIZATION>Martin</ORGANIZATION> after he wasindicted in <DATE>2004</DATE> on racketeering and bribery charges .

Campbell received a30-month prison sentence , far less than the nine years he could have gotten .

" Maybe if he had kept me , he would n't have gone to prison for three years , " Martin says.William <PERSON>Robert Martin</PERSON> is the sixth of eight children - six girls and two boys.He grew up in <LOCATION>Sewickley</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Pa.</LOCATION> , a borough of 4,000 on the <LOCATION>Ohio River</LOCATION> 12 miles fromPittsburgh .

Martin 's father , <PERSON>Felton</PERSON> , migrated from <LOCATION>Augusta</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ga.</LOCATION> , and toiled in the steel mills . 
Martin 's mother , <PERSON>Isabelle</PERSON> , was a <LOCATION>Lynchburg</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Va.</LOCATION> , native and second-generation " Sewickleyite " who stayed at home to raise herfamily , working occasionally as a caterer for the upper crust.Martin is quick to credit his dad with instilling in him a sense of hard workand punctuality .

He decided on law school after realizingthat he was good at arguing and making his case.His career began as a prosecutor with the city , where he enjoyed trials so muchthat if he finished one early , he 'd go from courtroom to courtroom persuadingother prosecutors to let him try the cases they did n't want.By the end of his first year , <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> had tried more than 50 cases , four timesthe average of his colleagues , he says proudly . 
" I had such a thirst for trials , " he says .

She asked herfriend <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> to dinner , too . 
" Whether intentionally or accidentally , she said yes to both of us , " recallsMichel , who at one point reported for The <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post.The three met at the <ORGANIZATION>Shark Bar</ORGANIZATION> restaurant on the <LOCATION>Upper West Side</LOCATION> . 
Martin andMichel exchanged pleasantries , but nothing came of the encounter . 
The pair metagain <DATE>seven months later</DATE> at the <ORGANIZATION>Radio and Television Correspondents ' AssociationDinner</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , where <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> received an award . 
As <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> congratulatedher , he noticed her struggling to hold the weighty crystal prize . 
" He took my shawl and bag and walked around with me so I could show off myaward , " she says.Martin gave her a lift home , and <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> decided to throw a dinner party to fixhim up with a friend . 
It did n't work . 
" It was kind of like magnets repelling each other , " she says.Martin and <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> " hung out " for the next couple of months , and <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> realized " I like him . " 
Their friendship blossomed.On Christmas Eve in <DATE>1999</DATE> , as <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> cleaned up after a family dinner , Martinshowed her two <ORGANIZATION>Pittsburgh Steelers</ORGANIZATION> ornaments and asked her to pick one .

One day , a box of trophies showed up . 
Yearspassed before <PERSON>Erica</PERSON> , now 37 , learned it was her father who donated them.He 'd rise at <TIME>6 a.m.</TIME> every weekday , work out in his home gym , then twice a weekdrop the twins at school . 
When the kids attended <PERSON>Lowell</PERSON> , the <MONEY>$ 30,000-a-yearprivate</MONEY> school , he 'd walk them from their 4,100-square-foot home in NorthwestWashington . 
" I would see him every morning , " says neighbor <PERSON>Denise Gibson Bailey</PERSON> . 
" He 'd holdtheir hands . 
It was very sweet . 
" Afterward , he 'd start returning some of the 100 or so e-mails he gets dailybefore arriving at the office by 9 . 
He was a loyal Metro rider until a homelessman " thought it was his mission " to announce that <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> was on the train . 
" Does everybody know who this man is ? " 
Martin says , imitating thewell-intentioned homeless man . 
" He 's one of the best lawyers in <LOCATION>D.C.</LOCATION> " " Everyone turned and looked at me , " he recalls . 
" I thought , ' I need moreprivacy . ' 
" Ask <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> about his favorite client and he does n't hesitate : <PERSON>Jayson Williams</PERSON> , the former <ORGANIZATION>NBA</ORGANIZATION> power forward . 
" <PERSON>Jayson</PERSON> really has a good heart , " he says . 
" He 's very thoughtful of others.People might find that hard to believe considering he was involved in ahomicide . 
" <PERSON>Williams</PERSON> was charged in <DATE>2002</DATE> with the <ORGANIZATION>Valentine</ORGANIZATION> 's Day shooting of a limousinedriver , whom <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> had hired to drive his friends from an event inPennsylvania to <ORGANIZATION>Williams</ORGANIZATION> 's estate in <LOCATION>New Jersey</LOCATION> .

" It really was an accident , " <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> says.His favorite case ? 
Representing <PERSON>Monica Lewinsky</PERSON> 's mother , <PERSON>Marcia Lewis Straus</PERSON> , in <DATE>1998</DATE> . 
And yes , he saw the blue dress . 
" How many times in a lifetime are you involved with a key witness in a case thatinvolves the impeachment of the president of the United States ? " 
Martin asks.Straus needed an attorney because independent counsel <PERSON>Kenneth W. Starr</PERSON> ' sprosecutors had subpoenaed her to testify against her daughter before theWhitewater grand jury looking into <PERSON>Lewinsky</PERSON> 's alleged sexual relationship withPresident <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> . 
She hired <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> after walking into his office . 
" The first thing I saw when I sat down was a painting - a portrait of MartinLuther King , " <PERSON>Straus</PERSON> remembers . 
" I was a student in the late '60s , and this wasa profoundly iconic image to me . 
And I knew I was in good hands . 
" <PERSON>Straus</PERSON> says <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> has a " brilliant legal mind " but says it 's his " extraordinarykindness and compassion for his clients " that sets him apart . 
" <PERSON>Billy</PERSON> did n't justcare about the law , he also cared about how his clients were affected by thelaw , " she adds.Straus recalls how <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> offered to drive to <LOCATION>Pittsburgh</LOCATION> to meet with her son , <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> , who was away at college and was unable to talk to his mother or sisterfor fear of being subpoenaed . 
" <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> ... has told me since that day how much that meant to him , " she says . 
" I will never forget that . 
" Martin fought to keep Straus from testifying , but failed . 
" It was a shock to both of us when I was ultimately forced to testify , " shesays . 
" After I broke down on the second day , he eloquently defended me outsideon the courthouse steps . 
" After <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> intern <PERSON>Chandra Levy</PERSON> , who had been romantically linked to Rep.Gary <PERSON>A. Condit</PERSON> ( D-Calif . )

A family friend recommended <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> .

<PERSON>Chandra Levy</PERSON> was found murdered a year later in Rock Creek Park.At his age , when many lawyers are cutting back or giving up their practice , <ORGANIZATION>Martin</ORGANIZATION> seems to thrive on the long hours . 
He recently wrapped up a two-yearstint as president of <ORGANIZATION>the Washington Bar Association</ORGANIZATION> . 
At a black-tie gala lastspring , <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> worked the room like a young politician campaigning for office.He greeted a prosecutor with a slap on the back , hugged old friends he had n'tseen in a while and gladly posed for pictures with anyone who asked . 
" I 'll know when it 's time , " <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> says about retirement . 
" But I 'm not thereyet . 
" Martin pulls his Cadillac into the garage , having just picked up Aminah fromgymnastics . 
As she scurries upstairs to her room , <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> throws a log on thefire in the family room , decorated with mementos from his wedding . 
In one corneris the broom that he and <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> jumped - an African custom that represents a newbeginning . 
The pillow carried by their ring bearer is nearby . 
On a wall is theirframed wedding invitation.Within minutes , <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> 's house is filled with family : <PERSON>Michel</PERSON> enters with theirson ; <ORGANIZATION>Martin</ORGANIZATION> 's two eldest daughters come in with their four young children intow . 
Their husbands are n't far behind.Chaos.Martin does n't mind .
