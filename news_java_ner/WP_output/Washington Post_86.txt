Trust might as well be a four-letter word . 
American public opinion seems to havebecome an unguided Weapon of Mass Suspicion , and it 's not hard to understandwhy . 
But those who would exploit distrust , dissatisfaction and anger forpolitical gain had better worry about collateral damage.The overhyped Tea Party phenomenon is more about symbolism and screaming thananything else . 
A " movement " that encompasses gun nuts , tax protesters , devoteesof the gold standard , <PERSON>Sarah Palin</PERSON> , insurance company lobbyists , " constitutionalists " who have not read the Constitution , Medicare recipients whooppose government-run health care , crazy " birthers " who claim President <PERSON>Obamawas</PERSON> born in another country , a contingent of outright racists ( come on , people , let 's be real ) and a bunch of fat-cat professional politicians pretending to be " outsiders " is not a coherent intellectual or political force.But even people who would n't be caught dead at a <ORGANIZATION>Tea Party</ORGANIZATION> rally have lost trustin powerful institutions that are supposed to be working in the public ' sinterest -- with considerable reason . 
Just look at the headlines.There 's obviously no reason to trust Wall Street . 
Theoretically , the only reasonfor the financial system to exist is to service the economy -- and the Americanpeople -- by channeling capital to its highest and best use . 
The charges filedlast week against <ORGANIZATION>Goldman Sachs</ORGANIZATION> illustrate the extent to which capitalism ' sprecepts have been turned on their head by financiers who believe the economyexists to service them.The allegation , basically , is that <PERSON>John Paulson</PERSON> , a hedge fund mogul who wantedto place a billion-dollar-bet that the housing market would deflate , persuadedGoldman to round up patsies who would bet the other way . 
Then the transactionwas allegedly rigged so that <PERSON>Paulson</PERSON> would almost surely win his wager , which hedid . 
Goldman denies the allegations of fraud and says that , in any event , itlost money on the deal.Leave aside for the moment whether <ORGANIZATION>Goldman</ORGANIZATION> 's action fell just inside or justoutside the line demarcating what was legal . 
What possible socially redeemingvalue did the transaction have ? 
How did the concoction of a " syntheticcollateralized debt obligation " benefit anyone except the lavishly compensatedtraders at <ORGANIZATION>Goldman</ORGANIZATION> and the outrageously compensated <PERSON>John Paulson</PERSON> ? 
Is this asystem the rest of us could possibly trust?Another story that wo n't go away is the pedophilia scandal in the Roman CatholicChurch . 
On <DATE>Sunday</DATE> , during a visit to <LOCATION>Malta</LOCATION> , Pope <PERSON>Benedict XVI</PERSON> prayed with eightadult victims of childhood sexual abuse by priests and reportedly expressed his " shame and sorrow . " 
But practically every day , there are new revelations ofpedophile priests having been transferred to other parishes rather than beingdefrocked and reported to authorities.A CNN poll showed that <PERCENT>56 percent</PERCENT> of <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Catholics disapprove of how Benedicthas dealt with the crisis . 
Even the judgment of the Vicar of Christ is beingquestioned.Perhaps most striking of all is a new <ORGANIZATION>Pew Research Center</ORGANIZATION> poll showing that thepublic 's trust in the federal government has plummeted . 
Just <PERCENT>22 percent</PERCENT> ofAmericans say they can trust the government all or most of the time , Pew found.Only <PERCENT>19 percent</PERCENT> of respondents say they are " basically content " with thegovernment , while <PERCENT>56 percent</PERCENT> are " frustrated " and another <PERCENT>21 percent</PERCENT> describethemselves as " angry . 
" According to the Pew survey , Americans have negative views of many largeinstitutions -- banks and financial firms , <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> , large corporations , thenational news media , federal agencies , the entertainment industry , labor unions.The nation still has a positive view of colleges and universities , churches , small businesses and technology companies . 
Respondents were evenly divided onthe <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> administration , with <PERCENT>45 percent</PERCENT> being positive and 45 percentnegative . 
Given the current climate , the president might be tempted to claim amoral victory.There are some contradictions in Pew 's findings . 
Americans strongly believe that " more government control over the economy " is a bad idea . 
But by a much biggermargin , they believe that " stricter regulation of financial companies " is a goodidea . 
This is the needle that <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> -- with an all-time-low approval ratingof <PERCENT>25 percent</PERCENT> -- is now trying to thread.Republicans have been actively encouraging this groundswell of distrust on thetheory that it 's bad for incumbents , meaning Democrats . 
Indeed , the approvalrating for the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> has plunged to <PERCENT>38 percent</PERCENT> . 
The problem is thatapproval of the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION> has also fallen -- to 37 percent.The moral here , for giddy <ORGANIZATION>GOP</ORGANIZATION> strategists , is the one about people who live inglass houses.The writer will be online to chat with readers at <TIME>1 p.m.</TIME> <ORGANIZATION>Eastern</ORGANIZATION> time Tuesday.Submit your questions and comments before or during the discussion.The writer will answer questions at <TIME>1 p.m.</TIME> <DATE>today</DATE> at www.washingtonpost.com .
