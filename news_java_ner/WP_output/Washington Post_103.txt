Someone , somewhere in cyberspace , does n't like <PERSON>Edward Donato</PERSON> , a <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> publicrelations man . 
For nearly nine months , in dozens of obscenity-laden postings onan Internet message board , <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> 's anonymous antagonist has let his or herfeelings be known unambiguously , usually to <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> 's dismay and distress . 
" Your [ sic ] going to die soon , " reads a typical posting , mentioning <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> byname . 
Sometimes the threats are aimed at him , sometimes at his teenage son.They 've falsely accused <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> of being a child molester , a drug abuser , apromiscuous homosexual . 
His street address , Social Security number and elderlyfather 's name have been posted . 
His tormentor occasionally posts under <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> ' sson 's name , or under that of his deceased mother.Donato has pleaded with the operator of the board to scrub the messages andbanish the offending party . 
But he 's made halting progress , and he thinks heknows why : The message board is operated by the <ORGANIZATION>American Civil Liberties Union</ORGANIZATION> , an organization that has long championed the First Amendment 's guarantee of freespeech.Donato believes the <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> has protected a miscreant , partly out of indifference , but primarily because the organization is reluctant to put itself in the ironic -- and perhaps embarrassing -- position of curtailing someone 's free speechrights on its own Web site . 
" I do n't believe that death threats should beprotected speech , " he says . 
" I 've written to [ <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> officials ] and said that thisperson is doing the equivalent of yelling ' fire ' in a crowded theater . 
" <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> officials acknowledge that some of the messages <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> has complained aboutviolated the Web site 's policies . 
At the same time , however , the organization issensitive about being placed in the hypocritical role of censor of theInternet 's unbridled give-and-take . 
" It 's not our judgment to decide what 's harassment , " says <PERSON>Gabe Rottman</PERSON> , an ACLUspokesman in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . 
" There 's a legal definition for that , and a legalrecourse for it . . . . This [ message board ] is supposed to be our gift to freespeech on the Internet . 
Speech that might be considered personally offensivemight get pulled on other boards , but not ours . 
" Indeed , companies and organizations that maintain message boards and chat rooms , such as America Online and washingtonpost.com , generally prohibit the posting ofvulgarities , threats and " hate speech , " admittedly a loosely defined class ofspeech.AOL , for instance , practices " zero tolerance " toward hate messages and physicalthreats made in its chat rooms and on its message boards , and removes suchmessages " promptly after we are notified , " says spokesman <PERSON>Nicholas Graham.Graham</PERSON> defined hate speech as language that degrades another based on " age , disability , ethnicity , gender , race , religion or sexual orientation . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> also has a lengthy series of posting guidelines , but it makes nospecific provision for vulgar or threatening messages . 
Its two main prohibitionsare against " spamming " -- sending identical messages , usually ads , to allmembers of a group -- and posting personal information about another member " which they have not made public online . 
" It also explicitly encourages more active and vigorous exchanges than arepermissible elsewhere . 
" This is a free speech forum , " reads its message boardpolicy . 
" It is not without rules and regulations or supervision , but it isconsiderably less regulated than most message boards . 
If you find thatdisturbing you may want to find a more regulated environment . 
" <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> 's exasperation with the messages posted about him and his family havebeen poured into a long-running campaign . 
For months , he has peppered the Website 's administrators with complaints , attaching a list of specific postings . 
Hehas written and called <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , including <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON>Nadine Strossen</PERSON> . 
He has contacted law enforcementofficials and turned the material over to an attorney.And still the messages keep coming . 
" You are one dead [ expletive ] , " read a note posted on <DATE>Tuesday</DATE> . 
It was signed " Your son , " followed by <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> 's son 's full name . 
In <DATE>June</DATE> , someone used <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> ' sson 's name to send this message : " I think you gave me aids daddy . 
" Although the <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> did remove some posts last <DATE>December</DATE> saying they revealedpersonal details , others were left untouched for months . 
A threat to decapitateDonato 's son , for example , came down two months after <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> alerted the <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> toit . 
As for other messages , the <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> that it would n't act againstmany of them because they did n't reveal personal information about <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> , otherthan his name . 
" We 're the <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> , " says <PERSON>Phil Gutis</PERSON> , the organization 's director oflegislative communications , " We 're not in the business of yanking posts . 
" <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> officials wo n't say so publicly , but there is concern that <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> is notall that he seems . 
In an e-mail correspondence with <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> , an <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> employee whohas since left the organization , said <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> officials were uneasy about takingaction because " they are worried you are trying to cause trouble . . . . Theconcern is that you are doing this for fun so that you can go around braggingthat you got the <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> to abridge the free speech rights of someone on theinternet . 
" <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> replied that he " resents " the notion that he would make up threatsagainst himself and his family , and repeatedly denied in interviews that he didso . 
<ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> officials could offer no evidence that <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> himself is posting themessages.But <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> does have an idea about who might be . 
For some time , he said , hemaintained an e-mail correspondence with a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> woman he met online . 
Thetwo became friendly and made arrangements to meet . 
But before that happened , <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> discovered that the woman had misrepresented certain facts about herself , and he broke off the relationship . 
He thinks the woman , or a male friend ofhers , is now paying him back , using personal information he had once shared withher.Yesterday , after several conversations with a <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> Post reporter , ACLUofficials said all of the messages <PERSON>Donato</PERSON> found objectionable have been removed , with the exception of several that did not identify him . 
" He complained and wedealt with it , " says <PERSON>Gutis.Except Donato</PERSON> says that is n't so . 
Clicking on his computer , he was easily ableto find offensive postings identifying him by name from <DATE>June</DATE> and even lastDecember , when his " nightmare " began . 
" When I saw them , I called , e-mailed , cried , complained , yelled , threatened and begged the <ORGANIZATION>ACLU</ORGANIZATION> to do something , " hesays . 
" They did nothing . "
