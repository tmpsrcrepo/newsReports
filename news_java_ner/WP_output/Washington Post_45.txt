Applying for a job at <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> ? 
Be prepared to disclose everything about yoursordid past.That 's the new drill at the mega-retailer , which will start running criminalbackground checks on applicants this <DATE>fall</DATE> . 
The company said it has no plans torun checks on its thousands of current employees.The retailer 's announcement this month triggered a wave of discussion andsurprise , but it probably should n't have.According to a study released by the <ORGANIZATION>Society for Human Resource Management</ORGANIZATION> inJanuary , <PERCENT>80 percent</PERCENT> of 270 companies surveyed -- which included manufacturing , insurance and retail industries , among others -- say they conduct criminalbackground checks on employees . 
That 's up from <PERCENT>51 percent</PERCENT> in <DATE>1996</DATE> . 
Why the increase ? 
Employees in government contracting and defense have alwayshad to go through stringent background checks . 
But , as we keep being told , theworld changed after <DATE>Sept. 11 , 2001</DATE> , and many companies like <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> seem to betrying to keep up with it . 
But there 's more . 
Lawsuits against companies foremployee behavior have increased . 
And background-check technology has made theprocess cheaper and easier.The <LOCATION>Bentonville</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ark.</LOCATION> , retailer is n't saying much about why it began testing theprocess a year ago . 
It was part of a " standard review we do on all practices andpolicies , " said spokesman <PERSON>Gus Whitcomb.But</PERSON> the announcement comes on the heels of two sexual assault cases involvingWal-Mart employees and children . 
In both cases , the accused molesters hadearlier convictions related to sexual offenses , something that would likely havebeen caught with a criminal background check . 
" Typically , in part because it was time-consuming and cost-prohibitive , [ retailers ] restricted [ background checks ] to key positions or those who hadaccess to high levels of cash , " said <PERSON>Daniel Butler</PERSON> , vice president of retailoperations at <ORGANIZATION>the National Retail Federation</ORGANIZATION> . 
" What we 're seeing over time is atool that is becoming more available and more affordable . 
" Usually , larger organizations set up a kiosk or computer terminal in theirhiring department to do the checks . 
Potential employees enter their name , dateof birth , Social Security number and current and former addresses.The background software checks the information given against several databasesto look for arrest records . 
That information automatically goes back to thehiring manager , according to <PERSON>James E. Lee</PERSON> , chief marketing officer <ORGANIZATION>atChoicePoint Inc.</ORGANIZATION> near Atlanta.ChoicePoint has been named by several sources as the company that will doWal-Mart 's checks , but neither <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION>ChoicePoint</ORGANIZATION> would confirm this . 
" In . . . such a litigious society , I 'm blown away they were n't doing backgroundchecks on frontline employees , the ones who have contact with the public . 
From aliability perspective , that 's amazing , " said <PERSON>Jared Callahan</PERSON> , sales director atEmployment <ORGANIZATION>Screening Resources</ORGANIZATION> , a human resource consulting firm thatspecializes in background screenings.Although the thought of a criminal check may leave some shaking in their shoes , it does n't necessarily mean they wo n't be able to sell , well , shoes . 
Companiesthat do checks typically disqualify people based on specifics . 
So if someone hasa DUI conviction , companies like <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> will probably still let them selldiscount stone-washed jeans and camouflage parkas . 
Of course , they probablywo n't have much luck getting a job driving a truck.But some people wonder whether such checks are legal.According to the <ORGANIZATION>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</ORGANIZATION> , while doing backgroundchecks is legal , the company has to be careful that its disqualification ofthose with records does not translate into racial discrimination , as has beenargued in courts , said <PERSON>Dianna Johnston</PERSON> , assistant legal counsel at the EEOC.According to an <ORGANIZATION>EEOC</ORGANIZATION> policy guidance , " since the use of arrest records as anabsolute bar to employment has a disparate impact on some protected groups , suchrecords alone can not be used to routinely exclude persons from employment . 
" <ORGANIZATION>Wal-Mart</ORGANIZATION> has emphasized that it would follow state law . 
But in a recentstatement , the company said that any employee found to have lied on anapplication regarding a criminal past will be disqualified for the job . 
" We actually get a lot of complaints and questions from those subject tobackground checks , " said <PERSON>Beth Givens</PERSON> , director of the Privacy RightsClearinghouse . 
" People are concerned that maybe a criminal conviction that hasbeen expunged might be found and impact them . 
They are concerned that perhapssomething they did in their youth could come up in the check . 
" In one instance reported to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse , a 49-year-oldengineer was fired from his job because a background check reported there was anoutstanding warrant for his arrest . 
After he spent hours trying to find thesource of the inaccurate information , he learned a background-check company hadconfused him with a much younger man with a similar name and of a differentrace.The company refused to change its report and the court refused to change thefile . 
The employee was not able to get his job back . 
The best this victim coulddo , according to <PERSON>Givens</PERSON> , was to obtain a letter , which he must carry with him tojob searches , from the state attorney general saying there is no outstandingwarrant for his arrest.And he 'll probably need that letter , no matter where he applies . 
" Employers are risk-averse , so they do n't want to hire someone who might causethem to be sued on down the line because of sexual harassment or identityfraud , " <PERSON>Givens</PERSON> said . 
" I think employers are much more cautious than five yearsago .
