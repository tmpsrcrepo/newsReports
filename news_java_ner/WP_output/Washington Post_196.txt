Federal agencies can no longer escape the cost of settlements and judgments indiscrimination and whistle-blower reprisal cases brought by their employees.Under the No Fear Act , agencies must reimburse the Judgment Fund at the TreasuryDepartment when they settle or lose bias and reprisal cases , effective today , the start of fiscal <DATE>2004</DATE> . 
Previously , agencies were not required to reimbursethe fund , and critics argued that let agencies avoid accountability for acts ofdiscrimination or reprisal against their employees . 
" It is pretty significant , " <PERSON>Mark A. Robbins</PERSON> , general counsel at the <ORGANIZATION>Office ofPersonnel Management</ORGANIZATION> , said yesterday . 
" A small agency with a big judgment isgoing to have to figure out how to pay for it . 
" The <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> has directed <ORGANIZATION>OPM</ORGANIZATION> to write the regulations implementing the law , and <PERSON>Robbins</PERSON> said the rules would be issued in stages . 
The first , being publishedthis week , lays out the reimbursement procedures that agencies must follow whenthey tap the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> fund to pay legal bills in bias and whistle-blower cases.The law does not specify how agencies are to make the reimbursements , except tosay that they can not raid employee pension funds or law enforcement accounts tocome up with the money.Robbins said the <ORGANIZATION>OPM</ORGANIZATION> 's regulations will give agencies a deadline for paying backfunds , such as 45 days . 
If an agency can not meet the reimbursement deadline , itwill be asked to submit a plan to the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury Department</ORGANIZATION> showing how it intendsto pay back the money.The law has raised concerns in numerous agencies , in part because of thereimbursement requirement . 
Officials have asked whether they could reducespending on a program , furlough employees or take some other drastic stepbecause they lose a big case . 
The law also raises difficult questions aboutwhether agencies must take stronger and swifter steps to discipline managersfound at fault in such cases.The law , the Notification and Federal Anti-Discrimination and Retaliation Act of2002 , grew out of a <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> investigation into what congressional aides called adisturbing pattern of intolerance , harassment and discrimination at <ORGANIZATION>theEnvironmental Protection Agency</ORGANIZATION> . 
During the probe , federal employees at otheragencies complained of similar problems.In the past , agencies could avoid financial penalties in bias and reprisal casesby turning to the Judgment Fund to cover their legal costs . 
<ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> created thegeneral fund to avoid having to approve specific appropriations for such legalbills and , in theory , to allow for prompter payment.But the No Fear Act removes that shield and hits them in their pocketbooks . 
" There is anxiety out in the departments and agencies over how this will playout over time , " <PERSON>Robbins</PERSON> said.Other regulations to implement the law will be issued during the next twomonths , he said . 
The law requires agencies to file reports with <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> and theattorney general on the number of complaints filed against them by employees , the disposition of each case , the total of all monetary awards charged againstthe agency and the number of employees disciplined for discrimination orharassment.Marsha Coleman-Adebayo , the leader of a coalition of federal employees who havesuffered from discrimination , said yesterday that her group would urge the <ORGANIZATION>WhiteHouse</ORGANIZATION> to become more involved in ensuring that agencies obey the No Fear Act andthat they tighten up their handling of bias complaints.Robbins said he plans to get feedback on No Fear regulations from the coalition.He also noted that <ORGANIZATION>OPM</ORGANIZATION> has been consulting with the <ORGANIZATION>Equal Employment OpportunityCommission</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Office of Special Counsel</ORGANIZATION> on how to fashion the regulations.What problems do you encounter when applying for federal jobs ?
